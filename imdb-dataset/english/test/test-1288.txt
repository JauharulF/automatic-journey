<START> i remember this film of old it's a great chilling atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a scottish castle only to discover that there are strange goings on in the corridors at night and there are even stranger events taking place out back in hollywood's most familiar hedge maze yes this is the maze you've seen in every feature length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle up to and including the shining but the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess i certainly didn't see it coming this is a fine example of how good and convincing a movie can be even when the premise is utterly loopy bordering on laughable i'd recommend it to anyone
<START> this was eisenstein's first completed project in over ten years the film takes place in the 13th century during an invasion of russian by germans teutonic knights i think released in 1938 its a very loose parallel to russia's nearing involvement in wwii and germany's advancement into eastern europe there are some incredible scenes most notable the battle near the end of the film and there is a shocker when children are thrown into a pit of fire but its not an easy watch the film drags and isn't as consistently brilliant as potemkin or ivan the terrible sometimes eisenstein is better in clips his brilliance is present however and its a must see for eisenstein fans and film historians russian propaganda at its finest
<START> even though he only made his debut film in australia and left for great britain and then america to continue his career australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was errol flynn i'm not sure he ever even went back to australia after his breakout success in captain blood still i attribute this film to the well known aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own br br part of the problem in telling errol flynn's life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir my wicked wicked ways i could see that a lot of the film was based on that and upon reading between the lines of that book br br his mother's infidelity to his father was not written but could have been inferred in reading my wicked wicked ways he didn't particularly like the woman that is clear from a few sources br br i wish the film had dealt more with his new guinea adventures that to me was the most interesting part of my wicked wicked ways as for his street fighting in the depression i tend to disbelieve that even if he had been successful at it i guarantee that enough of that would have ruined his looks and he would never have had a career as a leading man br br still the folks down under seem to think the atmosphere of sydney during the depression was captured well and guy pearce is a charismatic errol flynn american audiences know him best as the uptight but honest lieutenant in la confidential which came out the same year as flynn br br but la confidential was a far better film
<START> the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn't have to pay for it i saw it for free at college and if a college student can't find humor in something that was free it's hopeless br br stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet bewildering set design that goes out of its way to market volkswagon beetles i don't know what michaels myers was doing in this movie but i have never seen anything more depressing this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch which has its opponents but i enjoyed it very much it's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it br br you want a funny seuss adaptation go with the grinch
<START> i'm not the type of person to watch t v shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or too dramatic but this show is perfect everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situations everyone has their own personality and gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny rory gilmore is a good role model for all girls she takes pride in wanting to attend harvard and boys boyfriends always come second in her book she's a loyal friend and always the peace maker there's subtle romance which is what i like personally not the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives but a realistic type of romance every character eventually gets it and they don't find their prince charming at first glance and they don't just fall in love with every guy that comes their way it's a realistic show but when you watch it you better brush up on your movies pop culture and random facts because gilmore is always making references i fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance so will you
<START> this picture doesn't have any big explosions or expensive chase sequences however it does have really wonderful performances and an exceptional script that puts this at the top of my indie must see list taylor nichols and james remar are terrific together the young cast surprised me with really consistent acting usually indie pictures have some weak link but there are no weak links here impressive go get this one
<START> i remember watching this film as a kid and i was in complete awe of it i couldn't take my eyes of the television this movie has it all for horror fans this movie had no funny moments expect a couple of one liners by stooge who was my favorite character in the film kevin tenney directed this jewel and did a wonderful job with a low budget i thought the end was awesome the only thing that could stop them was by surviving the night they were unstoppable killing machines the effects done by steve johnson we're excellent i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for low budget horror movies because as the old saying goes they don't make them like this anymore the sequels were pretty good too but not as good as good as the original this is a must have in any horror collection buy it if you can find it you won't be disappointed
<START> this is the best french movie of the year i saw it twice and i found it great both times i didn't think it boring at all even though it is very long 3 hours i'm seventeen so i obviously didn't get to live the events of may 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in french history but it doesn't really matter since i still really enjoyed the film it's actually quite universal people of my parents' age can identify to the characters and so can people my age garrel seems to perfectly understand young people the way they think and the complications of love as well as the loss of illusions concerning the possibility of changing the world maybe that's because the character played by louis garrel his son is actually meant to represent philippe garrel himself well anyway great movie no action have to be honest on that point but so strong feelings that you can't possibly stay indifferent to it if you're looking for a relaxing sunday evening movie don't waste your time on this you'll be disappointed but if you like cinema you'll like les amants which is a bewitching movie close to those made in the 50's and 60's by the nouvelle vague artists
<START> i saw this movie today opened yesterday here and was simply delighted br br i saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie but then found it was based on shakespeare's twelfth night and then started trying to justify liking this flick on shakespearean grounds i really think this is going way overboard the only connections i could see with twelfth night are a the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man b the extensive male female humor arising out of that basic conceit and c some of the names including viola duke br br aside from those names the thematic a b are really great themes for any script and this movie's script is no exception beyond that though this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary traditional teen flick and that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it like alluding to shakespeare br br the movie is bright fast paced emotive stylized funny full of teen hormones and teen humor and male female humor suitable for all ages and that's really the best part imho really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over the top fun those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately with such a complexity of invention that i'm still a little bewildered but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard it's not that kind of a movie things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split second happening br br amanda bynes really is just delightful as viola sebastian channing tatum makes a wonderful duke david cross does a wonderfully over the top principal gold all of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target cinematography was excellent br br wonderful entertainment from beginning to end check it out
<START> i like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film terrance stamp guy pearce hugo weaving have all proved themselves as some of the best most capable actors around but i could not get into this i don't know if it's because i don't understand the lifestyle or what but i could not get my head around this film worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens i've ever seen i think that was part of the point i don't know i realize that is probably an insult but i don't know what else to call them i must say i bought the guys as the performers the correct term but the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either i will say that i can't usually appreciate costume designers very well although i notice them when they are wrong or out of place but i was very much impressed with these very creative to say the least just not attractive but i don't think they're supposed to be i don't know i am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers but i wouldn't go see ballet or opera either so i don't know if this is your kind of film then you will probably like it but if it's not skip it because it is well not for most of us i just checked it won the oscar for costume design i will say rightfully so i must say ebert didn't care much for this film either though he liked it better than i did
<START> since wesley snipes descended or ascended to the world of dtv action movies the result has been miss so so and miss was weak 7 seconds was entertaining the marksman was the proverbial scraping of the septic tank br br and what of the detonator we'll anything would be above suffering the marksman again but the detonator holds a small amount of merit that is hampered by a lazy star and low budget br br sonny griffith is a not so by the book covert op who busts illegal arms dealers in poland when his latest assignment ends up a bullet buffet leaving a pile of bodies sonny then is ordered to escort a witness nadia the ever hot silvia to the us trouble is sonny is being duped by a traitor in his own organization who is keeping his trail hot for gangsters with ambitions br br snipes delivers in the action department he is in half blade mode here he actually does well in the first 15 minutes of the detonator before descending into pure sleepwalking mode that ruined the marksman does more than look pretty there is some conviction to her scenes a lot of the actors look familiar and have been in the last 3 or 4 seagal snipes movies its always good to see michael brandon again br br the action is telegraphed here but never boring running car chases fights director po chih leong seems to have gotten better after the seagal farce out of reach he does a credible job but is constantly hampered by the low budget enough with the eastern euro locations its the movie's look cannot be that much expensive can it br br the detonator ends just average it does not have the so bad its fun aspect of mercenary for justice but it is nowhere near as entertaining as van damme's second in command nor as thrilling as dolph's mechanik perhaps dolph should direct wesley next eh br br its high time the producers pump a little more money and thought into these dtv titles with the kind of money they are making from them its only fair the result could be a high seller perhaps br br snipes would be advised to try making this one his last dtv action flick its sad to see yet another waste of this gifted actor's talents
<START> the peace and beauty of koyaanisqatsi was a powerful affirmation of the natural world in naqoyqatsi we are assaulted by images of the synthetic the competitive the violent and the digital the destructive constructs of our culture br br some liberties are taken with the images with distressing and much slow motion the connections between the sequences are inscrutable if there are any naqoyqatsi is defined at the film's end a missed opportunity to place the images in context br br the film is difficult to watch the quality of the archival footage uneven and it's most redeeming qualities are its theme and the hypnotic score of philip glass
<START> another bad spanish picture this is very baaaad i only save the photography and the music of josÃ© the rest of the film is the worst i've seen in years paz vega is horrible don't see it
<START> after the success of muppet babies warner brothers chalked up tiny toons but instead of making bugs bunny daffy duck and all the rest of the looney toon gang kids they created new animal characters who were kids with their own distinct personalities but personalities that nonetheless mirrored their predecessors the leads included buster babs bunny no relation which became their running gag or catch phrase plucky duck hampton pig dizzy devil shirley 'the' loon montana max furball the rats and assorted animals of prep and the original looney toons cast themselves the tiny toons lived in acme acres and attended acme where the looney toon gang worked as teachers who served as mentors to the younger generation the ins and out of comedy br br during the show's run various pot shots were taken at the bush sr administration pop culture and coupled with various other gags and spoofs br br buster babs arguably the show's main characters as mentioned above were similar to bugs bunny in some respects but they also had their own differing personality ticks and comic styles namely babs' tendency to impersonate anyone and everyone while buster capable of being a great goof himself usually played straight man or straight rabbit to babs' antics plucky duck was a virtual copy of daffy duck not screwball daffy but egomaniac daffy with nearly as big an ego as daffy and just as much of an obsession with upstaging the buster babs as daffy had with upstaging bugs though he usually fell flat on his face in his attempts yet he remained strangely endearing through out hampton was an even more shy version of porky pig and he had the thankless job of playing porky to daffy shirley the blond duck gal was a new age valley girl type whom plucky would go in and out of phases of mocking or vying for her affections dizzy was the purple version of the tasmanian devil furball was the silent sylvester and was the pink bird there was also the purple female skunk who longed for a boyfriend and the pint sized versions of wile coyote and the road runner evil was defined in the form of montana max a rich kid who was always out to make a buck or make people's lives miserable there was also a deranged animal lover whom everyone feared and then there was dodo an odd thing a ma gig creature who had no clearly designated species except that he was from wacky land or something like that br br pop culture references included batman quite frequently actually michael jackson vanilla ice dances with wolves indiana jones star trek fast food joints the ten commandments the twilight zones saturday night live and even the simpsons among others br br not only funny but it also managed to be warm and touching something it's successor animaniacs never quite attained also followed by taz mania
<START> now i like johnny vegas which is a good start i also enjoy toilet humour br br such as young ones and bottom etc this however failed to bring even a br br small smile to my face the story follows johnny around after his wife br br chucks him out how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know br br as he attempts to shag anything that moves failing normally i was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a waste br br of my time altogether unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother br br
