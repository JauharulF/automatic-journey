<START> although i don't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago i still think it is one of the best coming of age movies i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch i saw the opening titles of that movie and then i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there it really affected me personally i still remember how i felt when i first saw it i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a shy boy fantasizing about kissing his dream girl no offense but if that was an american movie you would certainly see at a certain point mainly climax the shy boy making love to his girl and i really can't grasp this contradicting concepts till now i have a simple request if anyone knows how to get this movie on a dvd by mail please let me know cause i need a shot of memories thanks
<START> touching bollywood epic melodrama about a 10 year old girl who finds out that she's adopted and is determined to find her birth mother the film's major success is the performance of p s who plays the girl the first half of the film is very good there are a few really good songs too especially the number that introduces the protagonist unfortunately the film's second half which takes place in war torn sri lanka feels like an entirely different and disappointing movie it's big on explosions and special effects with sri lankan soldiers and rebels dodging grenades running from fireballs and being yanked by stunt wires all the film can offer as insight are cheap platitudes like some day there must come peace and perhaps the children will find a way the final sequence where the daughter and mother are reunited is good but so over the top with the music and a well timed downpour that it feels like a cheat i know i know it's all in the style of bollywood but this is a story where big moments simply detract from the simple powerful central story bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times too
<START> honestly i have to admit that i go and see certain stupid films based on the hype they have generated or are currently generating this dumb salman khan govinda feature is one of those stupid films okay by now we've all seen starring will smith as a date doctor trying to help out odd people find true then why would we need to see salman khan re enact this therein lies the 64 000 question in case you were wondering govinda plays the oddball in search of the love of his life an unreachable socialite played by katrina kaif br br lara dutta is along to play eva mendes and real life love kaif pretty much plays her character like every role you've see her in thus far no stretch no acting required and for nearly three and a half hours we get tortured with spoofs of other bollywood films and characters or better yet we get treated to low rate performances of past hit films rajpal yadav co stars f
<START> not even cooking can save this disjointed idiotic nonsense starring as a tv chef from the food channel who with help of the crew to try to make the show better poor plot and stupid script throw this show down the drain robert urich wasted in the poorly supporting role and sadly this was his last one ever r i p br br this is the worst show of 2001 and it will be on the list of the worst shows of this decade br br i feel very sorry for for making this sitcom he even said himself it stunk br br it's hard to believe that they are the same producers of designing women that did this mess br br tv review 1 star
<START> did anyone notice when miss brook went skinny dipping she left the water wearing white bikini bottoms and yet had previously taken it all off to join cabin boy this could have been a good film without miss brooks phony accent and a year on the island please how come that kelly looked always clean and ready for a fm photo shoot what started out with premise turned in to soft porn and billy zane come on you cant be that hard up for film offers check out dead calm also when the people took her away how come she scoffed her face and after all that time didn't feel like throwing up i suggest billy find decent scripts kelly stick to photo shoots and cabin boy play the son of zorro in a future sequel
<START> wow what an overrated movie this turned out to be it was supposed to be an extremely suspenseful tale of a crazed killer holding a woman hostage and in terror in her home well i doubt it terrorized audiences in the early '50s and i know it would put today's audiences asleep br br sends shivers down the spine proclaims the new york times no the only shivers i get is that anyone is left on the planet who believes anything the n y times prints about anything br br well it was about a deranged man who held a woman hostage for a short time in her house but the man howard wilton robert ryan was actually harmless and friendly in fact this was one of the nicest roles ryan ever played yes wilton was nuts but he never harmed the woman and only wanted a friend to trust br br the film even turned boring after awhile with very little going on except a lot of yakking br br beware my reader this sucks
<START> if you're going to spoof james bond it's a brilliant idea to find a leading man who resembles both sean connery and leonard so step forward jean who captures perfectly the connery sneer that masquerades as a smile plus the self delusion of thinking he is suave plays it like a clouseau who can hold his own at karate the plot has him looking for our man in who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such improbabilities as a nazi cell concealed inside a pyramid if there is a jarring note it is the leading lady who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed but only just by it's good for one viewing but that's about it
<START> this is a must for all but especially african americans it is about time there is a movie that expresses and shows the concerns going on in african american relationships it also allows other cultures to see in a fictional humorous manner how positive african american relationships are and the outcomes of them instead of the undesirable stereotype that plagues the african american community i love this film a must see
<START> though i saw this movie dubbed in french so i'm sure it lost something in the translation lack of accents etc it was an excellent fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room a real pick me up that portrayed accurately and positively the complexities of individual sexuality gender role and finding a place within the communities to which one is supposed to belong male gay urban 30 ish etc i was very proud of french television for showing such an honest and positive portrayal of the gay community while the fact that the gay lead character ends up somewhat straight in the end is mildly disappointing that's life and that happens sometimes this is a great movie whether alone or with a date a really enjoyable experience
<START> michael played by steven robertson has palsy and lives a quiet and dull life in residential home when a newcomer to the home rory mcavoy befriends him he proceeds to show michael how to live past the disability despite or maybe because of crippling disability unable to move all but his head and a few digits on his hand rory is fiercely independent and extremely rebellious his affect upon the quiet and reserve michael is spectacular and the two soon leave the care home to set up lives in the outside world where they recruit the help of siobhan romola garai as a care assistant br br this film is one of the gems of the year much like last year's in america the film goes from being extremely funny to distressing touching upsetting and truly moving without once seeming saccharine sweet knowing exactly where to tug at the heartstrings and where to simply let the story and characters do their thing o'donnell has crafted a wonderful film which tells us all to look past the surface and see what lies within br br the true strengths of the film come in the lead actors so convincing are their characters that you truly do believe that they are disabled to further manage to convey humor and sorrow on top of the already great performances is amazing the pair really seem close friends and as their tale unfolds you care completely for them br br this is definitely one of the finest examples of film this year telling a very relevant story in a simple way if this film fails to touch your heart then you must contain pure ice inside
<START> wow this movie really sucked down below the normal scale of dull boring and unimaginative films i've seen recently the acting was poor and robotic the story was so bland you could have summed it up with a simple 5 minute short audio was so poor and dirty it was hard to even listen to perhaps it was unedited from the camera it was shot off of i'm not sure which movie the 3 glowing reviewers were commenting on but it wasn't this one perhaps the director had his hand in seeing that his film received a good review at least before the real reviews started to show up br br save your time or you'll just be wasting your time and money on this film absolute suckage
<START> matt is a loyal communist in a pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party even though this isolates himself from his son family and neighbors what makes this even more difficult is that is actually an fbi agent posing as a communist in order to obtain information about party activities the party is trying to create a strike at the mill whereby the pro strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda also has to contend with beautiful eve a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that is a double agent when eve learns the ugly truth about the party's real motives the reds decide she must be liquidated and must aid her without endangering himself the film should have plenty of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but by today's standards very cheesy propaganda and little action or thrills lovejoy is very good in the main role but even he and the rest of the cast seem listless few surprises here and how did this film receive a oscar nod for best documentary rating 4
<START> terror is saved from a '1 by the presence of canadian cutie simmons as the heroine she is a delight to watch from the front back and side otherwise what you have here is your standard monster movie playing like a low budget shipboard version of the relic john rhys davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported and the very monster is simply a man in a suit he does commit about 100 senseless gory killings at least so the body count in this one is pretty awesome formulaic to say the least i love the moment when simmons ominously tells someone what stands for goat eater scary
<START> house calls is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as how they used to make them it stars walter matthau in one of his best roles as a recently widowed doctor who goes out on the dating scene again and hits paydirt as he seems to have a different woman every night he then meets hospital patient glenda jackson and soon develops a relationship with her but it's one that will be severely tested as she informs him she is a one man woman and expects him to be a one woman man br br this is a sweet very funny film also starring art carney as the senile hospital administrator and richard benjamin as matthau's friend and fellow doctor it's a must see for any matthau fan or any fan of light comedy br br you won't be disappointed
<START> this film very succeed in the film festival in vary czech rep logically it' s based on a very good book excellent actors good camera the best director and icelandic it was probably the most black comedy i've seen br br i really do recommend it to you
