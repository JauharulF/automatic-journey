<START> the original isn't by any means a must see movie in the genre in fact if it weren't for it's chilling first 25 minutes there wouldn't be any logical reason for watching it the remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85 minute teen horror flick br br now i don't have anything against pg 13 horror movies but the tendency surrounding them is getting lame when you see the pg 13 rating you expect a movie filled with false scares teen t v or music stars and a plot that has been used for several times don't even ask for gore or violence br br i know that it's not correct to compare both the original and the remake but i think that it's necessary to do it because the whole idea of the new one is based on the beginning of the original the tension that is felt through the first movie is not present by any means in the remake not even with the amazing settings or great use of lightning no tension suspense thrills nothing the movie goes too slow before it gets a little interesting and that's when the stranger appears the chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there's a feeling of what will happen next but that's it the situations that set up for the climax are predictable boring and lack of suspense the original has merits for having suspense in the most important scenes and also for a chilling climax for the most important scene of the movie br br now i understand that this is a pg 13 horror movie but if you pay respect to the original why change it's most important situation the children are not supposed to survive after the ending i felt like this movie was pointless so the baby sitter was playing cat and mouse with a wacko that's it then the sequence at the hospital was plain stupid and worst of all it means that a sequel may be on the way br br camila belle is the best thing about the movie she delivers a cute believable performance she needs to pick better projects although this role will gain for her thousands of teenager fans br br please don't watch this movie some people say that in order to support the horror genre we are supposed to support any movie that comes out i don't necessary agree if we ignore movies like then the producers of horror movies will understand that we won't accept crap we want good horror movies not lame flicks filled with false scares br br watch the original when a stranger calls instead because it's first 25 minutes are way better than the whole pointless remake
<START> everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched well maybe a do good cab driver in philly is pushing it a little at least the cab drivers ive met but that's what makes the show great br br the fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun its highly watchable and even though u know mike wins out in the end he never wins in life david morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role his supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great br br all in all i watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action i watch this show because its got great acting a good premise and a great story line every week it's also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by or know what intersection he's at i love this show and i love philly give this show a shot
<START> when a movie called hell ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker clichÃ© with character names like comanche and the gent i braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that the dialogue soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while cc rider plays and they talk about sex and violence yawn the three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable seeing old men like bishop and madsen in a freaking ruffled shirt riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men trying desperately to relive their youth poor eric balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost even an appearance by dennis hopper in full easy rider swing couldn't save it and let's talk about the store bought tans shall we many have compared this to tarantino's work it is not even close what makes tarantino's work so brilliant is he knows it's over the top so he just goes balls out and takes it as far over the top as possible bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploitation genre
<START> project a ii is a classic jackie chan movie with all the kung fu crazy stunts and slapstick humor you expect not as good as the prequel but still it is a great movie if you just want something fun to watch the story is simple jackie chan versus the evil men so if you want a movie that you don't have to be a to understand i would suggest this one
<START> there is something about this show that keeps me watching and hoping for the future of it in the writing the jokes are few and far between and the story lines are a bore so i figure it must be the physical comedy and the visuals br br i do enjoy the camera movement set dressing and wardrobe it's amusingly highly contrasted against the dullness that reigns and i'm pretty sure every time i have laughed it was because of john or molly's physical comedy the two of them make a sickeningly cute couple that make me laugh and want to puke at the same time br br so here i go ready to sit down to kim one more time tonight to see what path this production will go down or up as the case may be looking forward positively
<START> tell you what that was excellent dylan moran is simply the funniest actor on screen and on stage and with micheal caine as your partner ain't to bad either both are great to watch in a really funny film true not all the gags come off but its worth sticking around for the ones that do but come on its got micheal caine in a dress in it the whole admission fees worth that and every time dylan moran's on screen its more like bernard blacks movie the story is two actors moran and caine who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by acting out different persona's to fool them all but getting away with it's a different matter basically the actors is a great british comedy that was somehow missed by many seriously if your a moran fan or want to see micheal caine in a dress definitely see this
<START> 'this is not a film' works because it is so true in what it is trying to say if you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus in on the message you will see a little bit of yourself in the main character michael whether male or female all of us have come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and a situation or a relationship did it really occur like we remembered what went wrong michael's desire to find grace is completely selfish more than anything he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out but even so he is a sympathetic character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships we would not be in them otherwise as the film ends i am not sure if michael has learned anything new about himself or not our best gauge on the relationship is through his friend nadia she is the soul of the movie and reminds us of how there are always two sides to every story i found michael to be pompous arrogant and just plain clueless which is exactly why i liked him he is a real character if you've ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship then this is a film for you in closing it is a film for everyone
<START> boyle heights los angeles legendary south american goat sucking vampire el is on the loose feeding on anyone unlucky enough to cross its path animal control officer eric alegria and expert author divide elina madison attempt to track down the creature but find their progress hampered by a pair of dumb cops money hungry locals keen to capture the beast for a fat reward and a couple of nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experiments br br stinking higher than a two week old taco el is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies might struggle to sit through with its dreadful script awful direction by not one but two talentless jones and paul laughable dialogue and some of the worst acting this side of a porn flick i recommend this film about as much as i do drinking the tap water in mexico br br as and proceed with their investigations viewers are treated to some incredibly weak gore the worst designed book jacket in history the most unconvincing dead person i've seen since the blinking corpse in dr butcher md and a high tech computerised security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a post br br to be fair for a guy in a rubber suit the monster itself is fairly creepy hairy with big claws and a face like a particularly ugly bat but its appearances are few and far between with more screen time spent on the tedious trials and tribulations of whiney officer than on the killer antics of the titular creature just how many times is it necessary to see handing in paperwork to his bitchy boss br br if like me you make the mistake of wasting your hard earned cash on this dreadful latino bilge in my case it was a whole consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually watching it
<START> black scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can morph into her snazzy armored scorpion mobile she battles the evil and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time imho i loved the bit about her having to say yo to get the car's computer to take orders is so evil he wants to give the entire city asthma it's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it the scene where black scorpion attacks her partner steals the show you'll know it when you see it this dvd also has a fun interview with joan she's a doll black scorpion is a fun dvd loved it
<START> i have some of the older videos and dvds of dr who i've played them over and over i adore each of the doctors for different reasons but due to a man in the bbc hierarchy dr who was canceled even though it was still one of the mainstays of the bbc line up with the departure of sylvester mccoy the doctor stayed alive through the fans bbc graciously allowed fans to write books and cartoons the momentum of dr who has been steady even after 1989 then they took a chance with paul mcgann the movie was flawed but it gave the bbc an idea of what we wanted in 1999 the man was gone and the newbies at the bbc felt it was time to bring the doctor back it was a complete success here in america the sci fi channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well although the writers were having to start over and explain the dr who mythology for new viewers it is incredible to me that they have done it in season 1 staring christopher eccleston with russell t davis as lead writer and phil collinson as producer the doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is the doctor who universe has always been about choice love and sacrifice this is what they provided it makes me want more and it saddens me that mr eccleston has chosen to leave the show my first doctor was doctor no 3 jon pertwee's doctor mr eccleston needn't worry about his position in the dr who universe it is as solid as the rest he is the 9th doctor i didn't know of mr eccleston prior to his performance in dr who but i do now i wish there was some way he could know there is push out in the dr who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it we have already seen that he is a great actor
<START> when i went to see this documentary on communist bloc musicals i was expecting something totally demented along the lines of a communist cop rock some scenes did deliver including a rousing clip from a soviet film called tractor drivers br br you'd think that moviemakers given the task of making ideologically correct musicals that sing dance and espouse the party line face insurmountable odds and yet one of the surprises of east side story is that some of the films presented actually looked promising one was a mid 1950s east german effort called my wife wants to sing in which as the title implies an unhappy seeks to launch a singing career over the objections of her traditionally minded husband br br another genuinely interesting looking movie also from east germany was called midnight revue in this film within a film the producers spoof their own creative plight with the story of a group of filmmakers under party orders to make a musical the on screen filmmakers themselves get to do a musical number about avoiding too hot subjects very reminiscent in tone of the 1957 movie silk stockings br br the documentary is marred by somewhat insipid narration but it's still a lot of fun to watch look for the closing dedication to the person who made it all possible
<START> eliza dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress she manages to be the rock steady centre of calling but that's not enough to rescue her tv series from mediocrity it's a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as dushku should go from a meaty supporting role in buffy the vampire slayer to this clunker br br unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip calling fails to excite on any level above hormonal the eponymous heroine spends a lot of her time running hither and yon across what must be a very small city in order to avert the deaths of good looking corpses to be that she's already met in the mortuary where she works despite all the running she does she always arrives looking like she's just stepped out of a portable air conditioned dressing room br br in every episode eliza dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to breath life into the bland characterless screenplays but it's a pointless exercise calling just lies on the slab gazing lifelessly at the ceiling
<START> audrey i know you truly cherish your husband ted's memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes dr seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories images fantasies and characters they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books br br it is indeed your property to do with as you wish i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while save what is left of dr seuss thank you
<START> i have to say that there is one redeeming speck in regards to this film it firmly establishes the bottom of the barrel now filmmakers know what to aim above when making a movie other than that i regret watching this debacle what shameless abandon the making of this film was what a waste of 100 000 that's right folks one hundred thousand dollars this film reminds me of that adult video awards show in which of group of industrial prostitutes stand up a praise themselves believing that they are real actors actresses and filmmakers ironic then how i've watched blue movies with better acting directing and writing i also found it funny that the executive producer justin just had to be in the movie he plays deputy jake barker i'm sure his acting career has taken off ted the writer has a part he no doubt was wallowing in the clichÃ©d glory he created it should be noted that carrie has a lead role in the movie you might remember her from gus van sant's 'elephant' though i'm not too sure that she'll want to write this film on her resume and i'm not sure which is a more depressing point money was spent to make this film or people are going to watch it along with and 'sky captain and the world of tomorrow' one of the worst films if not the worst film of 2004
<START> in hong kong 1962 the editor chow mo wan tony leung wai and his wife and the secretary su li zhen chan maggie cheung and her husband simultaneously move to an old building each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home and chow and li zhen have the same habits they like kung fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love later they realize that their mates are having an affair chow falls in love with li zhen but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level 'in the mood for love' is a very slow beautiful melancholic and romantic love story with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition the film had not had a screenplay and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting later the director edited his story based on the footages when chow moves to singapore there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966 when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined leaving questions such as who is the boy with li zhen my vote is eight br br title brazil Ã da 'love on the surface of the
