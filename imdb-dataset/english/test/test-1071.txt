<START> this movie started out as a quite decent looking film but it never really kicked off instead it became predictable and even a bit silly some scenes were quite well made the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch but since the story was quite slow it didn't manage to keep the interest alive and more importantly its not scary at all it's supposed to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting br br to be frank the actors weren't all that great either no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your days br br overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and once you've finished watching it it wont last long until its already forgotten br br the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores but i disagree and instead i would grade it 4 out of 10 if you still want some japanese horror i would suggest you watch ju on instead br br
<START> this movie was such a waste of my money it was disgusting as well as disturbing honestly i would never recommend this movie to anyone who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog seriously it was a waste of my time i kept watching the movie hoping it would get better and a plot would emerge but that never happened i'd rate the movie an f this movie should have been rated r for its disturbing nature i would never let children of any age see this movie this movie sucks this movie is horrible this movie was a waste of my time i could have spent the night doing some worth my time instead of renting this movie this movie was a waste of gas money to get to the store and definitely a waste of two dollars to watch it pretty much no one should watch this movie this movie should be banned and burned
<START> i always enjoy watching this cartoon with sylvester trying to catch tweety on a train rather than at grandma's house it's actually a standard fare but entertaining especially when tweety pulls the emergency stop cord one of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train when you watch this over and over like my little boy did who loves trains which is why he liked it so much you begin to notice some things br br throughout this short the position of the baggage car changes on the train either 3rd 4th or 5th and in long shots not at all the engine has either the number or or none at all the coal tender has either the number 99 or the letters s p q r on it or no number or letters at all the coaches carry the s p q r without the in long shots and then in closeups it has the words southeast and western br br all of this doesn't interfere with the story but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully br br still this cartoon is among my favorites with sylvester and tweety
<START> even worse then the incredibly boring the exorcism of emily rose it started off decently and right up until the mom said to the dad see i knew she was possessed in an i told you so voice it was a terrible line spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie every family member has an issue from the past with the priest the dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife or actually having an affair with her culminating with him killing his buddy then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadn't slept with his wife after all people are dying others are coming under possession and by this point most viewers don't even care anymore except for their employee miguel none of the characters in this movie was actually likable making it hard to care about any of them the acting was terrible and the writing even worse glad i saw it for free although i feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time i lost
<START> this movie travels farther on 8 gunshots 2 kisses and 100 clichÃ©s than should be possible yet it still works brilliant br br as i was driving home from the theater i tried to figure out how it got away with movie staples like the pages of a novel manuscript blowing across a beach or the impossible series of fortuitous coincidences without the entire audience standing up and screaming i've seen that a million times before and you've pushed beyond the edge of believability but the actors were so enchanting and the screen so filled with believable extras that i forgot to care a friend who saw it with me said it transported him to paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in indiana br br overall a romantic comedy thriller with subtlety wit and elan
<START> i really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star because the film has so many eye rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental br br the acting if you want to call it that is so stilted and contrived that it makes ed wood's actors appear life like sammy the lone black character must be husband in real life because he appears in her other films but he has zero acting ability his lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery though i suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character his old man make up in her other turkey pushed to the limit is no budget junior high school quality with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray painted hair br br i cannot fathom anyone actually buying this video unless people like to throw their own mystery science theater parties and need a copy of something like this on hand it really is beyond fear it's actually beyond funny
<START> this film would have put the typical hollywood tearjerkers to shame the emotions portrayed are subdued and understated in a very comfortable fashion the plot is cliche enough with a lead role having terminal disease this is not a spoiler and was well established quite early into the movie the method of execution is somehow unique from most love stories you ever saw not even a kiss was being exchanged and yet you will feel the enormous current of love between the two leads initially i assumed this restriction on emotions to be something to the typical eastern values but later decided against it br br this film is so understated that if you compare it with movies like cinema paradiso cp would have felt overtly manipulative by comparison so it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea br br after watching the film i have this strong feeling that holly wood love movies or love movies all around to be accurate have been glorifying romance or passion and label it as love i am sure we all have our own definitions and i wouldn't say these qualities are mutually exclusive but i would venture to say that the movie will let you wonder if there is any added dimension you have with you loved one br br it's very obvious that i enjoy this movie a lot considering the fact that the movie is so plain in appearance it is paradoxically one of the more cinematic movie i saw lately
<START> gromit in the curse of the were is the same type of animation and from the same creators of but the story now is other wallace a inventor who loves cheese and his smart dog gromit who is always helping wallace in his problems are trying to keep the rabbits away from everybody's vegetables since there is in their town an annual giant vegetable competition but when wallace tries an invention he did to make the rabbits avoids vegetable the one who is going to be cursed is him before watching this movie i didn't knew that these two characters already existed and were famous i loved gromit and i think he is one of the coolest dogs i already saw br br aka wallace gromit a dos brazil
<START> after spending five years in prison dr thomas reed played by the incomparable vincent ventresca himself to purgatory flats and winds up tending bar he soon meets the luscious angel faced sunny alexandra holden you are wicked he tells her you have no idea she replies as she her slo comfortable screw and languidly drags on her cig reed finds himself entwined in the violent troubles of her family and the femme fatale story unfolds set against the desolation and desperation of the oil drained western town br br canny direction great performances superb entourage work and some lust scenes that sizzle like the sun in purgatory
<START> granny directed by boris who sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psycho killer dressed in a old hag rubber mask and a interrupts their party br br they say you can't judge a book by its cover but it appears that the same is not true of dvds i was in the mood for a really bad horror film last night and since the cover of granny featured a shoddily photo shopped image of the titular killer swinging an axe terrible typography they even use the system font sand a definite design no no and credits featuring absolutely no one i had heard of i reckoned it would be pretty lousy br br it was br br when a film clocks in at just under an hour long it really shouldn't waste too much time before getting to the action granny however spends the first 20 minutes or so with its unlikable group of friends indulging in pointless games and extremely banal conversation anyone who actually stays with the film long enough for the killing to begin and i doubt most sane people would bother will be treated to several dreadful death scenes featuring amateurish gore loads of awful acting and a surprise ending that comes as no surprise if you've seen april fool's day then you'll guess what the twist is way before it is revealed br br granny is uninspired unexciting and almost unwatchable avoid
<START> i once saw a bit of this film and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars the result being that i agree basically the film begins with kermit the frog steve whitmire telling all his muppet chums that they have lost everything and he ends sitting depressed and possibly thinking about suicide on the bench meanwhile in another world heaven angel daniel david arquette who had already been in muppets from space visits the 'boss' whoopi goldberg another reason i wanted to see the film to show that kermit really needs help in the flashbacks it shows kermit miss piggy eric jacobson not the original and better frank oz gonzo dave goelz fozzie bear also jacobson pepe the bill and all the other muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the christmas holiday and it all seems to be going well but the really mean rachel bitterman joan cusack is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down and kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen of course kermit fails the last time and bitterman tells him that they are finished and she can officially take the theatre this is where daniel is sent as kermit's guardian angel to try and help him but kermit is not in the mood and eventually ends up saying i wish i was never born obviously you can recognise the spoof of it's a wonderful life with kermit as the george bailey and cusack as the mr potter and in the end obviously kermit realises how much he means to everyone and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark also starring whitmire as rizzo the rat and beaker goelz as dr bunsen and waldorf as dr teeth rowlf the dog and swedish chef jacobson as animal and yoda the only character who sounds similar to oz's version william h macy as glenn matthew lillard as luc fromage carson daly molly shannon zach sarah neil flynn john c mcginley and judy reyes mel brooks as joe snow brian henson as scooter and janice jerry nelson as robin the frog statler pops and floyd pepper and kevin clash as sam the eagle the most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of moulin rouge besides that and the well known faces in it not fantastic it was nominated the emmy for outstanding music and lyrics for the song everyone matters the muppets were number 47 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons adequate
<START> ok we were going along with the stereotypical bad orphanage experience and explaining to our son adopted from russia that this was over the top acting and dramatization so we could get to the dog playing soccer since he plays soccer but the last scene in which the dog goes back to his original owner put my son over the edge and he cried for 15 20 minutes he's been replaced this from an elementary child i do not recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child it displays adoption orphanages and adults badly and in the end even though they win the game the dog that the boy bonded with has to leave and this is too much please be wary if you have any adopted children and beware families with biological children because the impression of children who are adopted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and nasty the dog is cute but not enough to save our family's reaction to this movie
<START> sure it's hard being gay especially in the south we get it over and over again br br what stood out was that the film makers focused almost wholly on the more extreme characters in these small town gay bars the drag queens the seedy sleaze of a bar long closed and on a guy who was brutally murdered for being gay yet had nothing to do with either of the bars which were the focus of this film br br there were snippets of interviews from other people people viewers would perhaps be better able to relate to but they were glossed over practically skipped maybe shown in a glimpse in the background br br it would have been more interesting to me at least to hear the experiences of the more common gay men and women who were either enriched or otherwise by the experiences of a small town gay bar and or the absence of that community
<START> much about this movie was beautiful the acting the scenery and without a doubt aaron's cinematography background showed through on the beautiful shots definitely worth watching as your attention will be captivated the entire time and it ends on just the right note br br the acting by newcomer jonathan was superb as one would think he was a pro acting since he was born he has gone on to act in other feature films but this starring role will always be remembered br br the film does have that academy award feel to it at times where it's slow and scenic and quiet so it's not a movie that a d d kids can sit through however the rustic feel of east bend and played out well as a 1940's era film
<START> a straight forward x file that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence rob bowman's direction is crisp and sharp the episode looks just as fresh now as it did almost a decade ago david and gillian both give fine performances and both seem to relish the lack of baggage it's a standalone x file that even non fans could happen upon and enjoy junior brown gives both the leads a run for their money during his scene with them he's so convincing that you could believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to bryan cranston is intense and energetic as patrick crump he has since admitted in interviews that he knew next to nothing about the x files prior to this role a fact that makes his hit the floor running performance all the more incredible a brilliantly dumb episode
