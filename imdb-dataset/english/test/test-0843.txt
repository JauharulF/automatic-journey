<START> this great tv movie told of the 1975 murder of martha in greenwich connecticut by a nephew of ethel kennedy the use of the ghost of martha to provide some of the details was very effective and added a lot of heart to the story christopher meloni seemed to capture the personality of mark very well who got so much underserved bad publicity in the o j simpson trial has certainly vindicated himself by his contribution of bringing the killer to justice after about 27 years
<START> screen treatment of the comedic broadway success the gay divorce a title which was considered too scandalous for american moviegoers though it was used in the u k concerns a man and woman fred astaire and ginger rogers meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse they dance argue make up dance argue some more and dance some more betty grable is very appealing in a brief bit singing and dancing in the number let's k k with overtly edward everett horton but the star couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout the surroundings are screwball sophisticated yet the characters are not more than one dimensional 1 2 from
<START> is a visually astounding film however i felt as if some of the story line may have been sacrificed there is hardly any character development which left me feeling personally detached from the film which is ironic because all puns aside this film really does draw you in with its many slight spiral effects and stunning scene transitions at first the overall cinematography threw me off but as you get used to the overall appearance you start to see the beauty in this twisted film this is a great movie if you are looking for a looker with out too much substance or deeper meaning it is a great horror film that is not actually scary or suspenseful but somehow eerie
<START> this is a documentary unlike any other it has so many layers and shows us so much that trying to analyze it all at once is nearly impossible documentarian william greaves shows us the process of film making from a different perspective we see the struggles of the actors the director the sound crew and everybody else trying to hang in there and make this film successful if this was just about a movie being made it would be ordinary what greaves does is make it more complex by having a crew film the actors and then this will be filmed by another crew only to have another crew film the whole thing three cameras each with a different goal it has an almost dizzying affect on you but at the same time is exciting i like the parts where the crew organizes together and discusses what is going on even they are somewhat in the dark as to what greaves is trying to do half see this as an experiment while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confusing failure no matter what side you choose you can't argue that greaves doesn't get you involved in this process
<START> bad dialog slow story scenes that drag on and are absolutely pointless i can't believe this much money was invested in such a poorly written film the directing and acting couldn't save this bomb either br br 50 through the movie and you're still waiting for it to start they lay the foundation with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up nothing you watch 40 minutes of footage that is absolutely directionless in an attempt to do what i have no idea br br much of this film is like watching a really bad french movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just sort of dull lifeless and living without purpose or care br br avoid this film at all cost anyone that recommends it is setting you up for disappointment and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth
<START> a totally pathetic attempt at movie about sacrifices of australian soldiers during the new guinea campaign total waste of money even if you only see it on dvd thankfully the video store provided a free weekly hire with the dvd else it would have been a complete waste of money probably made by arty types and full of the symbolism that today's socialists seem so into frankly this movie is an insult to the memory of the brave chaps that never came back somebody please provide the funding to make a decent movie at least the equal of saving private ryan hopefully the will put as much distance between itself and this movie as possible the story needs to be told from all sides the australians the locals the japanese although getting the latter to tell the truth about anything that happened during the second world war is highly unlikely basically its rubbish don't see it don't buy it walk away
<START> this film is all right fairly silly and to be taken lightly but what i can't stand are the numerous heroes and that boy's sentimental comment near the end look they all look the same isn't that by far passing the good taste standards i thought it was revolting as were the heroic unselfish acts by some of the people in this film i'm not saying it won't happen like that but zooming in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach churn
<START> something strange is happening in remote areas of the arctic an air force weather station is found wrecked its occupants missing an eskimo village is destroyed a fishing vessel disappears curious are found in the snow a four foot piece of a living organism is found near a destroyed airplane the piece looks like half of the claw of a giant alaskan crab the military craig stevens as an air force officer and its experts are baffled a distinguished scientist william hopper and his pretty assistant alix are called in from new york hopper deduces from this flimsy evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous praying mantis he's right the pretty assistant happens to look out the window of the office and sees the hideous face with its bulging eyeballs staring in at her she drops what she's carrying her hands to her cheeks and screams in horror br br the mantis begins flying south along the gulf stream pausing now and again to attack major population centers like washington and new york to overturn buses and eat people military weapons don't affect it much but finally stevens crashes into it in his jet fighter and mortally damages the beast which comes to earth and occupies the manhattan tunnel linking new york and new jersey br br stevens having survived the collision leads his team into the tunnel and kills the big bug with mines despite its fierce appearance threatening behavior and earth shattering roars stevens and kiss in front of the body while hopper chuckles and takes their picture br br ho hum br br like the deadly mantis itself the formula by this time was panting and gasping for air flopping around seeking as its prey not human beings but anything at all in the way of a fresh or original idea as it is they overlooked one clichÃ© hopper should have hurriedly had to invent a super duper ddt that alone could defeat the insect that's what the mines should have been filled with rather than ordinary explosive br br the model work is pretty good considering what the budget must have been not much money could have been spent on anything else because everything else is pretty routine craig stevens is bland a face and style made for a tv series william hopper looks right tall and silver haired but his instrument has only one note the pretty assistant is rather plain considering her role the part calls for joan or laurie nelson they couldn't act either but carried with them slight but distinct of anything would have helped this fagged out movie br br i wish the deadly mantis hadn't roared so loudly and so often because you can't roar you can't even whisper if you don't have lungs i didn't mind though when the monster met its demise in the tunnel a praying mantis is a graceful insect in its own spindly way and it's great to have them in the garden because they eat and whatnot but when you get right down to it they aren't really very appealing the male mantis is smaller and weaker than the female as in humans and when the couple are just about through copulating the female bites the head off the male also as in humans but at least human males know when to stop the male mantis keeps on copulating for several minutes even though he is now without a head we humans don't have mindless males copulating with goal driven females do we
<START> although a woman's story i found this still fairly interesting it is unusual in that is has three real life sisters playing sisters in the movie i am referring to priscilla rosemary and lola lane br br why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad boy rebel john garfield in their twisted liberal dominated minds all american characters are sickening but sour on life poor attitude types like garfield played here are people they can identify with despite that this movie still has an overall feeling of goodness which is why i liked it some of the characters may have done stupid things but they good hearts whose heart was bigger than ann's priscilla lane in here i agree with the imdb user comments critic in here who says this is film as much as the beloved not by me garfield's br br with a director the caliber of michael curtiz the film is better than it might have been under someone else curtiz made sure no scene soapy or otherwise went on too long br br in addition to the lane sisters and garfield we have claude rains who adds much needed humor to the story jeffrey lynn the main love interest of the girls gale page dick foran frank mchugh and mae robson br br apparently this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin offs from it neither of them approaching this one in content and box office success
<START> hayao miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser on the cliff by the sea his latest animated film which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off i thought that the trailer featured its song which was quietly hypnotic and i didn't have to wait for an invite to make sure i got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie scheduled to open here next week br br for fans of studio ghibli films you'll probably know what you're in for as miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography that will win new fans over i'm embarrassed to say the least that i've so far watched only my neighbour totoro eyes that pile of ghibli dvds and love it to bits but i guess this would serve as a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that i would enjoy br br voiced by is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea with her constant forays in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek nonetheless these ambitions do not bode well with her humanoid dad fujimoto who harbours some hatred toward the human race for pollution and briefly touching a subplot on environmental protection revenge by mother nature as well an accident one day sees being washed ashore and picked up by five year old boy who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother lisa yamaguchi while dad koichi is mostly out to sea since he's a sailor and you can expect some moments of throwback to the likes of the little mermaid or splash made for kids saying anything more would be to spoil the fun br br the artwork here is still simply astounding even though it's in 2d glory knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on there are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame that you'll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all this definitely beats any 3d or cg animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity and not only from the artwork department but on its story too despite complaints coming in that it took a leaf from the hans christian andersen classic while there are avenues to make this film extremely dark it only suggested certain dark themes but opted instead for a film with more positive emotions suitable for both kids and adults alike br br at its core its about love that between the family members of koichi lisa and and especially between mother and son more so it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened and i tell you herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of bolt and eve all hands down characterization here is top notch and it's hard not to fall in love with in whichever form adopted especially when she's such a playful being who doesn't hide her emotions if she's upset with you either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face br br on the cliff by the sea is a definite shoo in to my top films of this year without hesitation and the next time i go to tokyo i'm sure as hell going to make my way to the ghibli museum to under the magical world brought to us by hayao miyazaki highly recommended film so don't you go missing this on the big screen
<START> i saw this movie on my flight from philly to denver the screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 x 10 so i really wasn't going to watch it but i like malcolm in the middle so i thought i'd watch just a few minutes next thing i know i'm sucked in having a great time and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by i agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment being one of the older baby boomers i was also pleased to see lee majors with a role in the movie as with a couple of other actors who were famous yesterday but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselves br br it's your basic kid is wronged kid gets even and then some and everyone enjoys themselves in the process no heavy thinking no great analysis needed just a good fun way to pass the time br br 3 5 out of 5
<START> hedy lamarr who may have been kept by more men on screen than any other actress is again the kept mistress of kent taylor society playboy and general all around rat on a boat from the after taylor's given her the brush she tries suicide but doctor spencer tracy saves her from drowning in the caribbean br br tracy's quite the all around medical fellow i guess he never heard the word specialist he runs a clinic in manhattan for the poor and his trip was a sideline into medical research lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him into her world and he even becomes a partner of society doctor louis calhern of course kent taylor reenters the picture and the hollywood inevitable happens br br watching i take this woman it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by tracy's oscar winning boys town unfortunately his role as doctor karl decker ain't a patch on what he did as father maybe they were trying to give father a little romance in his life in this film so to speak br br tracy and lamarr did not get along too well in fact this film was dubbed i retake this woman because the original director joseph von sternberg walked off the film presumably because lamarr was not working out for him the way marlene dietrich did she did lady of the tropics and then mgm went back to filming this with their contract director woody van dyke who was known for the speed of his productions and a whole new supporting cast was brought in br br fortunately both spence and hedy had better roles in store for both of them
<START> i cannot understand the need to jump backwards and forwards to scene set and pad out the plot showing that someone has a skill right before they use it i believe is offending our intelligence it's starting to feel a little contrived and as though they are making up for being so vague for the first three series a little disappointing this episode br br furthermore using past quirks like locke's ability to know when a storm is ending is frankly insulting are we supposed to ooh and or laugh at the softer side of locke br br this episode was all over the place
<START> the only positive thing i can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now i finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie i ever saw was called br br it would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even br br why would anyone want to produce such waste br br i refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented br br making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point br br anything else just doesn't make sense
<START> this movie is a story of a catholic nun as an advisor of convicted killer on death row the movie describes what she does as a nun who does not have any productive role she might have had doubt in her actual role but eventually she does the role only a nun could do who has nothing but faith in christ in america there are so many movies that describe condemned criminals or jails those scenes especially execution are too much different from japan
