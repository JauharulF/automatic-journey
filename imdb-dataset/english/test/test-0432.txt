<START> it's not fair i was really expecting this to be a hilarious entertaining movie i mean i like drake bell from drake and josh and leslie neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics airplane and the naked gun however after seeing superhero movie i'm glad i didn't even have to pay for it it just wouldn't have been anywhere near the 9 per ticket more like a dollar and a few pennies because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes and as disappointing as this film was i'm glad the running time was that short if not shorter i just cant believe how incredibly vulgar unnecessary and above all stupid some of the scenes were and above that i've seen better acting from a wooden dummy without the ventriloquist it's as if craig purposefully wanted to make a film that deserves its 3 7 if not lower and even try to be worse than meet the spartans very disappointing indeed
<START> this is quite possibly the worst documentary i have ever seen it looked so amateurish chris was one of the directors of the war room which was a great movie albeit a little one sided but it looked beautiful com looked like it was shot in some guy's basement the quality was so pitiful that i couldn't stand watching it i saw about 30 minutes or so and i had to take it back to blockbuster and get something else i can't understand how something so amateurish some from someone like chris how the hell did this win any awards to begin with the war room definitely deserved an award as did another great documentary called both won awards this documentary looked like it was done by uncle joe who also does weddings on the weekends shaky dimly lit unflattering lighting bad sound a 10 year old could make a better film than that guy did
<START> despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that i felt were not developed enough i enjoyed it and would recommend it to others richard gere and diane lane are great in their lead roles the basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they meet both also are searching for healing unexpectedly they find that they can help heal each other there were aspects of the film that i wished i'd seen play out more where simple flashes merely suggested themes that my mind had to fill in the blanks on such as the apology to the bereaved widower and how adrienne goes from feeling guilty about having slept with paul to feeling okay with it soon after an opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was merely suggested they were going to make love with the hurricane coming but in the end the film left me feeling deeply appreciative of the relationship that my wife and i share and there were moments that moved me to the verge of tears so i have to say it is well worth viewing
<START> comment that ms paget's ultra lewd dance in this film is the most erotic in the history of films is certainly one doozy of an exaggeration it isn't even debra paget's most erotic dance her near nude gyrations in fritz lang's the indian tomb make this number look decidedly tame as for being the most erotic in the history of dance well where do i start salma performance as pandemonium in from dusk to dawn 1996 jamie lee curtis in true lies 1994 jessica alba in sin city 2005 rose in terror planet 2007 sheila kelley in dancing at the blue iguana 2000 blah blah blah br br don't get me wrong i love the sequence and have included it in my cheesecake dance series on youtube i just think that making a claim like most erotic in the history of film is really going out on a very fragile limb
<START> this movie was awful plain and simple the animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics it was very clear to see that this film had about the budget of my grocery bill the acting was just as bad i've seen better acting in pornographic films i would seriously like the hour and twenty minutes of my life back in fact i registered on imdb just so that other people don't get sucked into watching this like i did don't get me wrong though i love sci fi films this one seemed more like the intro to a video game i'm glad i only spent a dollar to see this one the story line reminded me of the movie pitch black a prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes oh my goodness what are we gonna do i would not even let this play in the background of my house while i was cleaning bottom line here you can do better
<START> this movie was very disappointing and except for a few moments wasn't fly at all more than anything it was just flippin' stupid the music was frickin' bad and the plot played out like a byu bowl game Â very predictable avoiding embarrassment by scoring a late game flurry of a rally that falls short and leads to a loss in essence the half childish half naive will the movie's and his religiously confused brother danny we'll just call him a democrat treat kirby the movie's sweet spirit the 3rd member of their hapless mormon boy band like crap until the man and father figure of the film the stage manager jill has a talk with will and straightens him out believably will's personality changes 180 degrees and he's instantly the mature and self aware leader of the band this would be a cute perhaps funny 10 minute roadshow gig but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long really sucks the life out of you if you watch it to the end my advise Â take the money you'd normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your fireplace or flush it down the toilet Â more entertainment with much less time commitment if you want to watch a better movie of the same genre get saints and soldiers Â not a comedy but an infinitely better show actually kirby has more funny stuff in saints than he does in sop
<START> how does a movie become a biblical epic simply by quoting a couple of scriptures using some names out of the bible for your characters the only thing that was biblical about this epic was the names of the characters oh i almost forgot the 3 kingdoms israel egypt sheba were also used where did king vidor get the rest of his story from it surely wasn't from the bible it was complete utter nonsense if you want to read about solomon's reign as king in israel then read 1 kings 1 11 2 chronicles 1 9 you will even come across in 1 kings 1 2 the queen of sheba who doesn't show up until king solomon has been king for about 20 years or so which by the way is long after joab had been dead can be found in 1 kings 10 2 chronicles 9 one of the first thing solomon does is make an affinity with pharoah by taking his daughter br br yes king solomon did get involved with the worshipping of false gods this is why the kingdom was split after his death not the temple being destroyed by lightning also i think solomon was too busy marrying providing temples to the false gods of his 700 wives tending to his 300 concubines to be fighting egypt let alone a dead brother br br like i said this movie was utter nonsense if you aren't gonna use the story in the bible then call it something else this could've just as easily been called romeo juliet or sid nancy br br
<START> i must give credit to billy dee for trying to pull this off knowing this was a blaxploitation film i started my dvd with a certain expectation i knew it would be low budget the acting sub par but hoped for a few gems to be sprinkled throughout if there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal or perhaps overacting as an actor and filmmaker i cringed often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances yet i must admit i could not look away i don't know if this was like a car wreck you can't turn your eyes from or some mysterious power in the film that kept me there this film is a good case for an excellent story that was told wrong if walter were to tell the aristocrats joke it would be a total flop although the joke itself is hilarious let dave tell it and we are all rolling on the floor laughing this film needed a chapelle now with that said if you have the opportunity to purchase this film for the dollar that i did do it it is well worth the money perhaps i will take another dollar purchase the rights to this film and remake it who knows it might not be any better but it surely can't be any worse
<START> when alfred hitchcock made strangers on a train it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form from 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with david o selznick ended because of this actually he made some really good films in the period such as notorious spellbound under capricorn rope and my opinion stagestruck but while notorious and spellbound were liked the audiences were turned off by hitch's attempts at experimentation his use of a dream sequence by dali in spellbound was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists but the experiment with long takes in rope confused the public making ignore the merits of that film and the willingness of hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked far more disliked then it deserved to be in stagestruck a matter of bad timing for under capricorn it was released just as the scandal of it's star ingrid bergman and roberto broke out made it seem to be a failure which it wasn't the case was another failure and one that really had little in it's favor br br with strangers on a train hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity based on a novel by patricia highsmith the story was of how guy haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his bruno anthony a playboy who is traveling on a cross country train at the same time as the athlete bruno is talkative and fawning and guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met if a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space but bruno knows all about guy's personal problems he is married to a promiscuous young woman named miriam and is in love with anne morton daughter of a senator bruno knows that miriam won't divorce her successful celebrity husband bruno mentions how he can sympathize he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him then bruno mentions sort of off the cuff an idea he has about two men technically strangers exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect crimes instead of fumbling them guy listens to the idea and agrees it is an interesting idea the train reaches guy's destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea he just does not realize that the eccentric bruno is a sociopath and believes guy has just agreed to the two killing each other's foe br br it's a wonderfully simple plot actually bruno of course does kill miriam but he fully expects guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather guy is horrified and worse he finds that he is the police department's number one suspect when bruno to encourage guy mentions he has the latter's lighter he pocketed it on the train and can plant it at the murder site guy finds himself in deeper problems how to avoid the police and how to control if possible the insane bruno br br hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other there are constant cross contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's orbits it is like fate drawing them together yet both have their own personality and hitch with a typical twist makes the mad bruno actually more of an attractive figure his scheme may be vicious it will kill two people if successful and he will have guy live up to the agreement no matter what but he has a zest for life one suspects that once guy too had one but his marriage's failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he was br br the cast is good too robert walker probably had his finest role in this film only a year before his death it was a far cry from the homespun boy next door of since you went away or the clock his lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes as guy farley granger acts like a cousin of his co murderer in rope especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to jimmy stewart as for the ladies rogers is properly sluttish as miriam enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses so that they actually are cheering bruno in his act of evil patricia hitchcock appears as the younger sister of anne ruth roman who bears a close resemblance to miriam and accidentally sets off bruno at a social occasion she plays this rare role well ruth roman is properly supportive of granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed other supporting performers leo g caroll as the senator marion lorne usually a comedian as bruno's dotty mother and norma as an unexpected recipient of violence from walker are all shown to best advantage all at the hand of a master
<START> the film begins with a cranky old broadway producer exceptionally well played by veteran character actor richard carle being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play however there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night fortunately there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew and despised however while this seems like bad and contrived writing it is not as this is all part of an elaborate ruse by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot however part way through the ruse the producer and his assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny what no one realizes though is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plot making for some wonderful twists and turns so when it seems that there is a real murder the actors are truly terrified while carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax while i have explained some of the plot there are many more aspects of the film you'll just have to figure out yourself and it's surely to keep you entertained and guessing br br considering that this is a b movie in the public domain i certainly did not have very high hopes for this little film however i was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flick with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clichÃ©d plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion plus while the plotting of the film was very good the dialog was even better with lots of sparkling wit and a nice light hearted pace full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time
<START> the beginning voice over sounds like 'the wind' could be quite an intriguing movie but as the story unfolded i knew it was downhill from there the major things about this movie that blew were the terribly bad acting jobs all the main characters did except for a few scenes involving the inner turmoil of mic there was a total lack of character development and absolutely no point to the plot what were the writers thinking br br michael won 2 'horror sci fi' awards for 'the wind' huh what was so scary about this movie nothing except for the resident evil 2 video shots the rest was more of a 'made for t v thriller' it wouldn't even have to be edited if you want a far better movie about 'murder among friends' rent shallow grave instead br br 'the wind'
<START> tempest is a somewhat self indulgent uneven discursive movie but as lord byron another visitor to greece protested to his friend john murray about his similarly self indulgent and discursive don juan it may be profligate but is it not life is it not the thing br br the connections to shakespeare's tempest may seem as another commentator here claims a bit tenuous but watch the film again after re reading the tempest and they'll seem far closer what makes this film flawed is its uneasy mixture of straightforward normal narrative and sudden jarring apparent improvisation particularly between cassavetes and rowland but to be honest these scenes are the most remarkable and gripping in the film if the hardest to watch br br the music of this film composed by is also overlooked particularly fine is the perfect little piece played to accompany the afternoon siesta as people animals and seemingly the entire island collapse to sleep away the hottest part of the afternoon it's a sublime moment and representative of the best aspect of this movie and the one thing that keeps it somewhat unified the fact that aside from extensive flashbacks and the very end it is the story of one day on an island from awakening to night br br overall i'd rather watch this film a hundred times than see some bombastic hollywood piece of crap once and in fact i probably have watched it several dozen times most times i see something i missed before br br confession i'm biased this was the second movie i took my greek american goddess wife to see br br trivia notes on this flick br br it was molly ringwald's first movie as well as sam br br it was actually not filmed on an island but in the southern tip of the remote mani peninsula of the of greece br br the by today's standards primitive special effects were done by who later became head of disney and still later was an adviser to the us intelligence community br br paul mazursky the director chose the title of his recent autobiography show me the magic from the script of tempest
<START> did people expect jurassic park 3 to be full of surprises not one moment of it is worth it many elements could easily scare people out of the movies and it's not the dinos tea leoni i think she's a great actress but i'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line i wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie laura dern she's ok but why not be more noticeable in the movie maybe exchange smart dialogs with sam neil alessandro nivola have you ever heard of something called facial expression emotions he's got to work harder on that sam neil no big deal the soundtrack got to change that record or you get tired of it my applause goes to william h macy a talented actor who i've never seen playing a bad role unfortunately he can't save the movie nor can the well computer created dinosaurs
<START> perhaps i'm just a simple person but i prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them i couldn't care less about anyone in this movie this was supposed to be a comedy maybe the humor was too subtle for me all the way down to the nano level the thing about it is it missed on so many things there were characters that could have been funny but they weren't there were characters that you could have liked but you didn't for instance the guy who thought the beatles ripped off his songs there was so much potential there but all he did was talk like a beatle and complain about how they ripped him off haha and the previous poster talked about the 'i am the scene like it was special what he played 'i am the on an old piano and sang out of tune is there an inside joke there it sure stank at face value this movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds 'intellectual' or 'hip' to say you like it that you get the whole metaphysical art garbage message the artist is expressing if you want to be entertained stay away
<START> age of steel follows up the previous episode rise of the which was excellent in some respects lacking in others rotc had some positive elements the most important being excellent portrayal of the doctor indeed his sort of daft giddiness bears to this writer the shadow of tom baker's doctor with his sort of subconscious asides as when ticking off time periods when mickey is holding down the button in the tardis yet brings his own aloof superiority a la mccoy's doctor as he lets events coalesce around him some reviewers and fans whose pieces i've read seem a bit dismayed at having such a young actor portray someone who must by now be over a 1000 old but i disagree doctor does indeed bear the weight of the world on his shoulders as he points out in this episode and one can see this in his almost smug characterization as when he finally confronts the in the climax his world weary eyes rolling sort of attitude is refreshing especially after eccleston's excellent pseudo working class interpretation of the character more the man of action than fresh faced pseudo doofus best moment is perhaps after the end when he is restoring the tardis with his big goofy baker esquire grin as the tardis re starts here we begin to get a feeling for this new doctor a character who is little more than the average person's different personality facets split up into 13 different people some contradictory some more likable than others yet all forming part of a whole this aside these two episodes were passable but weak the concept of reviving the is much welcomed and they look fantastic but the plot involving a parallel earth where this action takes place doesn't seem to work right true the allegory here of humans' reliance on technology and their need to serve it as the doctor points out is outstanding but this could easily have been placed on contemporary earth or thereabouts some other weak spots are as others have pointed out the ease with which the doctor and co get out of the tight spots viz the death ray from the tardis component the seemingly endless array of uses of the sonic screwdriver my wife laughed when they were using it to burn through the rope ladder at the end she has barely watched who so i had to explain that it was used traditionally as a plot device to extricate the characters from situations from which there is no other escape used here sadly some of the acting was wanting especially mickey who really needs his due and some of the supporting cast was creepy as he needed to be his voice even sounded esquire the score was horrific though with the music's volume often out the scene overall i found rise of the more entertaining though the second half was passable the build up to what we knew was inevitable plays out well however the resolution was disappointing too many unlikely escapes no development of the supporting cast and not enough tennant in my opinion this new show is outstanding and davies is taking it in a good direction but the dialogue beyond the doctor's needs to be tightened up as illustrate which were pure ham
