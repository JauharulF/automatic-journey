<START> this educational show focused on emotions interactions and relationships it was produced at detroit's abc affiliate and syndicated in 90 markets nationwide this past week detroit public tv had a 1 1 2 hour clip show as part of their pledge drive wow the memories that resurfaced while i remembered the show there were segments that i'd forgotten about but remembered instantly a soon as they'd begin hot fudge holy detective tomato and the pies in his face br br for more on the public television special do a search for hot fudge comin' concert
<START> looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie they aren't even being smart about it 10 10 in the votes i guess that to buck the curve and offset all the 1 10's it will get is this better than any decent zombie movie no br br acting corny and rubbish br br sound effects cheap and nasty if it wasn't for where the actors looked you wouldn't know where it was coming from br br cinematography these people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix less is more but more from this team is absolutely pap br br zombies are rubbish as well i don't doubt most of these people will never be heard from again and it will be for good reason i hope zombies eat their eyes as this was 90 minutes of pap that i wont get back br br and falsifying ratings just makes it a million times worse br br one reviewer said it was one of the best horror movies he has seen in the last 30 years i can only assume that his recent cornea transplant was a success then br br watch the trailer as thats a warning as to how bad this film is
<START> i use imdb very much mainly reading comments of other people about movies iÂ´ve or not seen iÂ´ve thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and the way i look a movie i think i have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94 when i saw it in the theatre for the first time br br i feel kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time and i think this is his best one it was his last one i was very sad the day i knew he has died because sure we lost the chance to get something more from him br br red is just the best kieslowski performance by trintignant jacob cinematography by if you havenÂ´t seen it look for it if you have just come back to it br br red just a masterpiece please forgive my poor english reader
<START> i recently attended sundance as i have often done in years past and was treated to the small pleasures of the edgy little indies the glut of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of dysfunction but then i saw mark and michael and i remembered why i so fell in love with the movies in the first place sweeps across the screen with visionary daring and harkens back to the seminal early work of terence malick and the existential landscapes of antonioni it's an impossible film to easily explain which is one of its many strengths suffice it to say it's an adult fairy tale with many carefully layered levels of meaning it reawakened my imagination and cast an imposing shadow over all the other films i saw this year it is a work of meticulous craftsmanship and a sophistication of writing not seen in most american movies i plan to revisit this film several times when it comes to my theater for it is a beguiling piece of magic and mystery a haunting work where one can roam the plains of montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth the cast performs this piece with striking conviction particularly james woods and nick nolte who remind us of the nerve and daring displayed throughout the course of their careers maybe will help us find a new wave of american cinema where excellence in craft and writing become more the norm than the exception see it when it comes your way and take your friends for the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings spurred by seeing will awaken memories of great movie once seen in your past and now hopefully may be returning with the advent of the polish brothers
<START> first off mexican werewolf in texas' title is misleading as many others have pointed out it is actually about el which is a similar creature to a werewolf but by no means the same br br the production and editing just plain suck when it was over i probably wouldn't be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly the looked like for whenever it was in a scene despite one or two exceptions the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monster's face clearly the special effects were laughably bad but that has to be expected from a low budget horror movie br br along with the terrible production comes the bad actors now a couple give fairly plausible performances erika fay and martine hughes but then there were the bad actors everybody else who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died then there's the absolutely terrible actor sara who gives one of the 2 worst performances i've ever seen in a movie i mean my god she was indescribably bad br br the plot was very simple basically a is in a small texan town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it however even with the plot being this simple a few plot holes managed to leak through br br anyways horrible movie however if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night this would be a pretty good one my friends and i had a good time watching this probably the 2nd worst movie i've ever seen 1 10 awful
<START> wonderful songs sprightly animation and authentic live action make this a classic adaptation of a classic tale a nice british feel which sets it apart and above from the standard saccharine sweet disney cartoons
<START> rabbit fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches each one of them focussing on a female personal device that was made popular by a single 1998 episode of sex and the city the latter half of 1998 rather than the early episodes which were all directed by women from opening statistics that make rabbit fever sound like a soft porn movie we are treated to a sea of predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world run amok with women's addiction to solitary pleasure br br men as germaine greer rather arrogantly explains have invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom the rabbit vibrator which some statistics suggest accounts for about a quarter of all vibrator sales is so called because of little rabbit like long ears which vibrate to stimulate the clitoris while rotating pearls inside the shaft stimulate the inside of the vagina the film interviews characters that attend rabbits anonymous to help overcome their 'addiction' as well as known people such as tom conti posing as a professor or richard branson amid scenes of rabbits being banned on aircraft saying he would like to provide free rabbits to his first class air travel passengers and ultimately to all of them br br the main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to sustain 85 minutes of cinema the sketches don't have the writing skills of say a charlotte church or ricky gervais to make them funny enough and while it might make desultory late night tv doesn't have a hook to get people to queue up in public at multiplexes to watch masturbation jokes br br lines like it's been nearly a week since you used your rabbit how are you coping wear rather thin after five minutes the film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word will get a laugh and another one and another one frantic midnight drives to buy batteries might be amusing in real life but here they look rather laborious and the special emergency delivery service its welcome br br strangely the bbfc gave it an 18 certificate in spite of zero violence hardly any explicit sex and sexual references that are less than any late night comedy show the company protested the decision but the bbfc didn't budge at first sight this seems overkill on their part and their consumer advice now simply says contains frequent strong sex references one might think that youngsters would find masturbation jokes funnier than the most desperate of hen night parties and the topic one worthy of debate but rabbit fever does not even have the saving grace of a balanced approach to its subject matter br br the best part is probably the rabbit song by who play a band called thumper in the film for those who have dozed off and woken up at the end credits there is a bonus scene at the end of them to reassure them that they haven't missed anything
<START> just to correct something in a previous review here i don't believe this film is only for people who know london it's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments jack says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who by going though this gruelling knowledge test gain some measure of self knowledge br br i think it's one of the most perfectly written dramas i've seen technically it's supremely adept at conveying quite complex details but it's also joyous in how it involves you at the start you know no more about this london knowledge test than the main characters but you get scooped up right along with them until it's important to you you become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed and you are crushed for those who don't especially one whose downfall without giving anything anyway will make your hands fly to your face br br also just as a point of fact nigel hawthorne's character mr burgess is called the vampire not dracula you don't need to know this i'm not saying it's crucial but it's a measure of the drama once you've seen this you will want everyone to and you will about its every detail br br i hope you get to see it br br william
<START> bride of chucky is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90's br br spoilers br br chucky's girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park her neighbor jessie nick and his girlfriend jade katherine heigl are being tormented by her uncle john ritter tiffany upsets chucky when he refuses to marry her so she buys a doll for him to play with chucky kills tiffany and then transfers her soul into the doll she got him in order for them to be placed back into human bodies they have to travel to new jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from ritter and they set out on the journey but not before ritter is killed by chucky and tiffany along the way several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast when several more people are killed they call up their best friend gordon to straighten out the situation they convince him neither one of them are the killers as the police have began to solve the crimes he finds ritter's body in a trunk in the back of the van thinking he has been set up he confronts them about it chucky and tiffany then turn real to prove they did it which gets killed the group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery jessie and jade get chucky and tiffany to turn on each other giving them enough to escape chucky recaptures jade and forces her to get his amulet chucky and tiffany restart their feud which gives jessie and jade enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and clears them of the crimes br br the good news i have to give the most amount of props to the fx department as chucky and tiffany as dolls look completely convincing the scenes with them together are the movies main highlights including a hilarious conversation where tiffany advises chucky on how serial killers in the 90's work that being said the amount of one liners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible chucky gets the most of them but tiffany cracks a few gems as well it is actually funnier than what hollywood calls comedies these days the gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative turning ritter into a new form of pinhead was a totally brilliant scene the couple was a nice death scene as well for teenage love the pairing of and heigl works great they have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple i also have to admit that the first time i saw this movie i did jump during certain scenes and that shows what an incredible job director yu did he learned enough apparently to do the same thing with freddy vs jason he knows how to stage set ups and pay offs and here he shows some great skills that have a hong kong influenced look and style he could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two nice soundtrack too like freddy vs jason br br the bad news for fans of cheesy movies this will be a great find however this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film the film knows it is a cheesy movie and revels in it making a serious fan turned off because of things like the one liners it isn't all that bad of a movie but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie not to take it away remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie br br the final verdict fans of cheesy movies and the other child's play movies will find a lot to like about this movie for serious horror fans take a look at it but keep in mind that it isn't a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking it br br rated r graphic violence graphic language brief nudity on a doll a shadowy puppet sex scene some drug use and numerous drug references
<START> forget the lousy acting that can be forgiven in this sort of film or even the terrible unnatural dialog and illogical events if my subtitles actually reflected what was said far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made watching the film it feels completely out of date even though it was 'only' made 7 years ago a computer virus as a portal to the afterlife lol a dial up ghost images photoshopped on pictures he look over there is that is that a face zoom in on face oops sound breaks off next scene scenes and sequences are poorly edited and as a result don't flow at all you'll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently unaffected smiling and going about br br apart from the many problems i have with the movie in terms of production value it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus utterly boring br br i recommend in stead an oriental thai horror movie done well
<START> 1 bolo yeung is in the movie ten minutes altogether including when he's serving iced drinks to his boss 2 a lot of street thugs looking like junkyard keepers get instantly overpowered by the asian superhero who talks like an illegal alien just out of the back of a manure truck 3 thug let this to me shirt off gay model like muscles hee hap hap he's dead on the floor with his neck elbow chin or balls broken 4 cheap semi sex scenes where the white broad come out of nowhere digs the asian superhero 5 norton former c action movies star does nothing but pose as an eccentric trendy weapon smuggler who traffics white slutty girls hand picked at a night club where they willingly follow some idiot posing as a millionaire snapping at them you reap what you sow 6 yes the local police captain is involved and yes the first butchered cop is the former patrol teammate of the super hero 7 action scenes are fake like a hee haw chinese tries some spinning kick b skinny leg of chinese to the throat of negro thug c finishing death move to his head too much like walker texas ranger fake action 8 end titles finally br br utter rubbish those people are good enough only to be stand ins or body doubles in other c movies and be credited at most collectively as stunt crew provided by the county prison
<START> i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it br br the conversations between and her mother plus and matthew are very touching the community is shown very truthfully and as as it usually is br br although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable br br luckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand br br i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it
<START> the person making taffy in this movie was so realistic that person must have been trained so well if i were buying taffy from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy i would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling taffy
<START> i disagree 100 with the reviewer who disagreed 100 with the reviewer who gave this short movie an f grade cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures joe dante's lack of ability to pull another howling out of his bag of tricks the masters of horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales save for this episode br br despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it's political slant homecoming is the least effective episode of moh season one unlike the rest of the series dante's entry is a parody of the genre falling short of both horror and humor in it's ham fisted delivery of a hackneyed political point br br dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf as it wasn't his creation the zombie sub genre is very popular this decade and among the crop of predictable george romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or ir messages such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans maybe dante really isn't a a master of horror either what has he been up to since the howling after all br br if you want a lame anti war zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor homecoming may be just your thing if you are a horror fan looking for something masterful pick up most any other episode of the series my personal favorite was dario argento's jenifer based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of bruce jones and truly creepy
<START> ok everybody agreed on what was the best season the first and killing off boone was a bad also killing off others was bad blame the directors and writers for it bad boys but i still think this is the best scifi series ever sorry guys i can't help it i see that the quality of the series was after the first season still it's easy to accept liam as the new main character if you are over boone he is really mysterious the thing that shocked me most was when lilli was written out of the story and how that was something she didn't deserve and what do we get some blonde chick called renee with absolutely no character but these stay mysterious and you stay wondering about true plans till the end true suspence the conversations between and are sometimes brilliant br br i understand that when you jump in on an episode from the 3th 4th or 5th season you may not understand this show but when you watch from the beginning you just cant break loose br br the acting is great the special fx are marvellous the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing gotta see this guys
