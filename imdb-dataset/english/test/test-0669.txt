<START> the third film based on charles play entitled mystery of the wax museum 1933 targets generation x twin screenwriters chad hayes and carey w hayes spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies a promising start their condition guarantees an authentic point of view the role of paige paris hilton was not much of a stretch for the world's favorite heiress she in style stripteases boys chats on a cell and frets over an ill conceived pregnancy her regular routine has been altered beyond repair hilton reached the peak of her performance not so hot during the 1 night in paris 2004 parody while the pimp my ride is in motion she looks for lip balm in her boyfriend's robert ri'chard lap finally the actress for using the n word on the sex tape director serra molds his take on the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past each exhibited opposite characteristics back then whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the womb today however the latter does not rule out the former childbirth constitutes the luck of the draw spectators can hardly consider vincent brian van holt a contemporary quasimodo granted the recluses share some similarities such as artistry disfigurement submissiveness and murder yet one small variable between the two makes all the difference vincent is even uglier on the inside than he is on the out house of wax pays homage to actor vincent price from the first remake in 1953 the film leaves obvious van gogh puns to the imagination of the audience still the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end professor henry vincent price unmasking receives runner up but the most terrifying one in horror movie history belongs to lon chaney in phantom of the opera 1925 as far as the new contender is concerned the aftermath of separation surgery downplays the effect a surgeon should know operating on siamese twins scars them physically and psychologically their father needs to call a couple colleagues dr phil to consult and dr mcnamara to nip tuck despite what the trailers said wax is not forever in fact you can rid yourself of it by burning it
<START> i was completely drawn into the story but i wonder if perhaps i shouldn't have been so sympathetic to the hurt character's plight for respect because when it boils down i really think that glam reporters such as barbara walters is the devil or maybe the filmmakers were telling us that we're all unknowing supporters of fluff news stories
<START> the merchant of venice is a fantastic movie it's very true to the original shakespeare play if you saw jeremy irons in casanova and liked his performance this is a movie for you if you saw joseph fiennes in shakespeare in love and you enjoyed his performance this is a movie for you if you saw al pacino in donnie brasco and liked his performance this is a movie for you it is a very enjoyable movie and if you're studying shakespeare like me this is a great movie to see the only problem with this movie is that you can't let the little ones see it because is has a wee bit of nudity in it but other than that it's a really good movie
<START> a film that deserved theatrical release this made for television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of michael mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images always with mr mann the of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy award winning actor added to the ensemble of cast writer director and cinematographer br br this film is definitely one of my all time favorites while nothing is perfect this film comes very very close br br along with an excellent script great direction and masterful acting by richard strauss there is an all star ensemble of character actors at their finest roger mosely brian dennehy ed lauter geoffrey lewis richard moll miguel william prince burton ji tu richard lawson and billy green bush you may not recognize the names but you will recognize every face br br if this comes on tv sit down with popcorn turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film i highly recommend recording it since it is only available on vhs and dvd from holland and the dvd is region 2 encoded
<START> the untold origin of the lone ranger it shows who he was and how and why he became the ranger br br legendary bomb the idea was not a bad one reinvent and introduce the lone ranger for 1980s audiences right off the bat though there were problems the studio ordered clayton moore the original ranger to stop appearing anywhere as the lone ranger it led to a nasty little battle that made headlines i know of people who refused to see the film because of how moore was treated also they hired the awesomely untalented to play the ranger was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and just couldn't act in fact his whole vocal performance was redubbed by another actor also his off screen antics public drunkenness and beating people up didn't help matters acting aside the script is dull and slow also the ranger himself doesn't show up until an hour in there were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a pg however i don't think it was that bad br br there are a few very few things done right here the photography was truly beautiful michael horse was excellent as tonto christopher lloyd is lots of fun as the villain and when the lone ranger finally shows up with the william tell overture booming from the soundtrack it's really rousing but all in all this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the lone ranger it's easy to see why this bombed a 4 mostly for the photography
<START> this movie has some of the worst production values and editing i've ever seen there are several instances of actors pausing while trying to remember their lines actors walking in front of actors who are talking and one point where the film skips about seven frames not to mention the heroine getting shot in the chest yet she starts limping oh and what about the secret passageway that is well lit and right out in the open awful br br the plot is non existant something to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the earth and some kind of caveman war ator pulls out a hang glider at one point in the film's dumbest moment the dialogue is stupid containing such gems as it is everything and nothing and i can feel it here br br the movie is a mess a confusing insipid mess ator is a bland hero the sword fights are absurd and the plot plods along slowly all in all this is a movie to avoid
<START> a very great movie br br a big love story lots of sword fighting huge battle scenes heros and villains real history br br few in the west know much chinese history chin founded china the country is in fact named after him some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed this is a historical epic of how he ended the period of contending states and unified china he founded a dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the han dynasty that permanently defined chinese civilization ever since br br chin or the king of as he was known before he founded the empire was roughly contemporaneous with hannibal and in the west the parallel roman world dominance west and east worlds was achieved without a single towering personality like chin it would not be for another century before the west produced caesar the nearest comparable western figure br br chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot history only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film the famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote can be gong li is lovely she is the emotional core of the story it all makes for great movie making
<START> despite a totally misleading advertising campaign this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichÃ©d sub par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending clue 1 for all considering seeing this turkey sam raimi didn't direct it although commercials for the movie play up his involvement in truth he is one of four producers it's too bad that someone as talented as raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie i don't think he would ever have directed something like this that task was left to the pang brothers br br the screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other horror films so you'll find absolutely zero original content in the what we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of pulse a couple that could have come from the birds one or two from the others etc nearly every scene almost every line of dialogue is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the surprise ending long before it comes br br right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts has nothing to do with this movie in fact everyone can see the ghosts the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them even quite early in the movie i'm sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal which otherwise is entirely absent now you know so don't be fooled perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors it simply isn't there all of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened anyhow didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots loud noises visual flashes and anything short of a figure jumping out of a closet and yelling boo all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house if there's any message that the delivers it's don't waste your time on this movie
<START> although a made for cable film by hbo it is an enjoyable movie and a fascinating look at the back stabbing and double dealing world of television allowing the viewer to peek behind the scenes of the so called late night talk show wars in the early 90s as jay leno and david letterman competed for the coveted position as host of the tonight show kathy bates gives a bravo performance as leno's mercurial manager helen and one can feel empathy for what leno letterman endured at the hands of tv executives it is just as timely now considering the recent events involving the failed attempt by abc to replace nightline with letterman no matter how many times i have seen this film i still find it as much a pleasure to watch as i did when it first aired if this should ever be released on dvd i would certainly add it to my collection
<START> okay maybe it was because i happen to be in china when i saw this movie maybe it was because i finally had something on tv i could understand or at least read the subtitles or maybe it was just funny whatever it was this movie was worth the time br br i had just arrived for my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so i could watch tv usually i would turn the darn thing off but i stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked br br the plot if you could call it a plot sort of revolves around a cooking competition and sort of is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star if you like iron chef and many of the other cooking shows currently in the reality tv mode then you will love the scenes with food in this movie br br it goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better be up on speed reading for this one however the action is mostly slapstick so you don't always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea br br the main actress is lovely eye candy and the main actor isn't bad to look at either they are both worth watching finally if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh this isn't a bad choice for both br br i don't speak a word of chinese but i was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film for those who do speak chinese maybe it is even better overall i give this an 8 out of 10 and currently i am even looking to find a copy to have while i stay in china and keep for when i come back home it will be a nice reminder for me of my time in and a silly afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie
<START> if you are looking for a movie that doesn't take itself seriously than haggard is for you i must say before i write anything more that if you have not seen any of the camp kill yourself videos than the movie most likely won't be as funny my advice is to watch a few clips of those videos that bam and his friends made haggard does not take itself seriously at all and that was never the purpose throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot which may get annoying but its nothing that is out of control even through all that the plot does stay focused and the story of ryan dunn's character does unfold quite nicely this plot i have been told is based off a true story for the most part of ryan dunn's ex girlfriend brandon is by far the best character in the movie he has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh he stole the movie if you ask me overall i love this movie for its simplicity and straight up weirdness its a bam movie people its not going to be normal haggard is filled with hilarious quotes that my friends and i constantly used since the first time we saw it i've seen the movie 6 7 times and still find new things every time the soundtrack is just as good everything from kill to new order and some techno just don't go into the movie with high expectations let it all unfold and then judge it for what it is
<START> like steven seagal i also am a big van damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting career br br in this flick van damme assumes the role of jack whom is a cop that just moved to new mexico from new orleans to work as part of the border patrol haunted by memories of his past it is up to jack to put an end to a group of ex navy seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the u s that killed his daughter br br overall i found this film to be very good van damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move the action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing unfortunately van damme does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago regardless the shepherd border control is the 3rd straight solid film that van damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger project br br i definitely recommend this movie to a van damme fan or fan of action movies in general the shepherd border control is a great movie not as good as until death but better than the hard corps be sure to give this one a try you will not be disappointed
<START> it is important and only fair to remember that at the time this short was produced a state of war existed between the united states and the empire of japan add to that the enormous ill will that the beginning of the war created as well as the bataan death march and other incidents and the only thing surprising about this short and others is that there weren't more of them one other thing my only problem with this short is that it seems to try to be funny but it isn't i'm not sure that anyone connected with it really tried to make the jokes work or even cared it would have been far better if they had done what disney did with education for death and been totally serious but this short gets a bad rap and shouldn't be judged out of context the times were different then and that is an important consideration anyone expending energy trying to save the world from a sixty year old cartoon needs to take a step back as do i expending energy defending that same cartoon this should be available to interested parties even if not in wide circulation not a nice cartoon but sometimes life isn't nice recommended
<START> it borrowed scenes from lotr matrix star wars etc the humor is so dry contrived and corny that you can't help but laugh occasionally at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it exactly what you'd expect from an hk comedy the average person would enter with an iq of 100 and leave with less than 80 stephen chow is an obvious omission from this movie the humor would have worked better with stephen the mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the cantonese original the graphics are poor compared to its hollywood counterparts there is on low quality cg my biggest complaint is its ending the origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the journey to the west that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line despite its many flaws this movie has far more entertainment value than the other movie nicholas tse starred in the promise
<START> normally i would say i loved this movie not for acting although that was ok not for the script which was so so the reason i would have normally loved this movie is for the intense action which starts from the get go and doesn't end until the final credits roll but the problem with this movie and i felt it was a big problem was the horrible cgi it looks like they ran out of money and couldn't complete the the effects shots a lot of the effects look lime they are in their very roughest form since it is obvious they didn't have enough money to finish the movie they should not have released it i actual found the effects insulting it seems obvious they didn't care about making a decent end product for the consumer if it weren't for that i would give this movie a much higher rating my vote for air panic is a 3 10
