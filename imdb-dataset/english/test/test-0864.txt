<START> when the movie begins it's obvious just how old and sick the boys are although oliver hardy is enormous it is stanley that looks like death warmed over apparently he was deathly ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half here he looks like a dying man additionally as i watched the film i was shocked how many pratfalls stan took i half expected his to drop dead from the exertion i really can't understand why they came out of retirement considering their health especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film br br stanley inherits an island and a boat he and ollie are ready to leave when antoine a man is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island along the way they discover that giovanni has away but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island it seems like paradise and they are all very happy a bit later a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grand br br unfortunately uranium is discovered on the island and the place becomes flooded with riffraff eventually the mob decides to hang the four men and take over at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared br br i will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting however one thing it is not is funny and that is unforgivable for a laurel and hardy flick while not a bad film it certainly isn't a good one a sad end to their brilliant careers br br all the actors except for the duo are dubbed into english as the movie was made in france while it may not be the very worst film they made this would be the big noise it sure is close watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident
<START> from the brilliant mind that brought us the exorcist and cruising rampage is unfortunately more like the latter it's an overall messy movie that has a major made for tv vibe going for it the whole film pretends to hinge on the question what if the 'boy next door' was a serial killer but instead it winds up being an uninspired courtroom drama and meditation on the the insanity plea and death penalty that makes little sense the movie is very loosely based on the richard trenton chase case a few facts here and there to make a fake character and a different outcome one of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a terminally braindead child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow sometimes you just have to choose says the lead character yeah sometimes you have to choose to pull the plug on your tv
<START> this is no doubt one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time i was expecting alot more from the actors it started alright then things go from idiotic to absolutely ridiculous definitely not worth renting except if its a free rental
<START> this is a great example of very none hollywood film making which is very thought provoking moving and not without a sense of humor kevin mckidd and paula sage are superb br br i actually watched it on late night tv and i can see why i missed it in the cinema its not the sort of film that the multi screen mega cinemas show nowadays mores the pity br br i am going to look for the dvd not for those who prefer the current trend towards special effects and no story if you liked the best selling book the curious incident of the dog in the night time you'll enjoy this film br br this film ranks beside the best of scottish films such as small faces and trainspotting all films which kevin mckidd also star in br br highly recommended
<START> the daytime tv of films seldom have i felt so little attachment to characters seldom have i been made to cringe by such dire dialogue nauseous london thirty somethings mincing round lurid bbc sets spouting platitudinous mulch avoid this film as if it were your grandmother's
<START> the belief in the big other as an invisible power structure which exists in the real is the most succinct definition of paranoia Â slavoj zizek br br this is a review of marathon man and the falcon and the snowman two films by director john schlesinger br br though hitchcock and lang brought the conspiracy thriller to hollywood the genre only blossomed in the late 60s and 70s with films like the parallax view z marathon man capricorn one the manchurian candidate three days of the condor and all the president's men this was the age of vietnam and watergate the public deeply suspicious of all political leaders br br the genre remained quiet in the 80s and early 90s until the x files tv series sprung to life with taglines such as the truth is out there and trust no one the series posited a world of vast conspiracies and government plots the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate schemes the only way out of the maze fight the future as the tagline of the series' final season proclaimed it was apparently our duty to through the labyrinth of information discovering some elusive truth that ensured our own freedom br br this trend ended with the boom of the internet conspiracy thrillers now giving way to conspiracy documentaries the internet generation lapped up such independent documentaries as loose change and zeitgeist whilst in the mainstream michael moore titillated his audience with stuff like fahrenheit 9 11 all these documentaries believed in a secret order a cabal of wealthy politicians and businessmen who conspire to reduce human rights and enslave the world they struggle to create a mono myth linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single all encompassing narrative that explains the purpose and point and future of everything br br this need to streamline narratives to make them more efficient is reflected in the scientific community who battle to create a grand unification theory and ultimately a theory of everything merging everything from quantum mechanics to special relativity into one giant all encompassing formula br br so ultimately the conspiracy thriller is rooted in man's desire to have control the modern subject is one who displays outright cynicism towards official institutions yet at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies an unseen other pulling the strings this apparently contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is strictly related to the demise of the big other its disappearance causes us to construct an other of the other conspiracy in order to escape the unbearable freedom its loss causes conversely there is no need to take the big other seriously if we believe in an other of the other we're therefore allowed to display cynicism and belief in equal measures br br man thus seeks to assert control over a wayward universe to create a kind of paternal babysitter be it god a mathematical formula a conspiracy theory an explanation for violence conspiracies murder war etc who provides meaning and symbolic order the big other provides to the believer it's a lifestyle choice akin to religion in which his place in the world is dependent on sheer irrationality br br the problem with most conspiracy thrillers from the innocent days of hitchcock's all the way up to modern fare like the da vinci code are two fold firstly they are not incorrect in suggesting that something is wrong amongst the elite or best people but they are incorrect in and processes that are social collective and an approach which implies that it is just a question of personal morality rather than social structures secondly and most importantly these conspiracies ignore the fact that the big other simply doesn't exist there is no symbolic order pulling the strings br br some modern conspiracy thrillers eyes wide shut etc acknowledge this with their webs of lies accidents truths and half truths nothing ever adding up nothing ever making sense the real and the the truth and the desire all blurred without any identifiable ground zero but these are mostly films by intellectual directors br br compared to these modern conspiracy thrillers marathon man and the falcon and the snowman are positively archaic marathon man is a about a grad student dustin hoffman who gets embroiled in his big brother's business roy scheider which unfortunately has to do with spies guns double agents diamonds and evil nazi dentists scheider is suave hoffman is excellent and schlesinger hits us with some neat visuals the reveal of the eiffel tower is stunning but what's most interesting about the film is the way that its various plot lines don't intersect until the 1 hour mark even then it takes a further half hour for things to start making sense unfortunately the film ends with a clichÃ©d showdown between the villain and the good guy everything neatly resolved and explained br br the falcon and the snowman is a bit more ambitious sean penn and timothy hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the soviet union hutton works at a civil defence contractor and smuggles information out of his office and into the hands of penn a small time drug dealer who has no qualms selling to the kgb penn does this strictly for the money whilst hutton is disillusioned with the american government particularly its attempt to depose the leader of australia and so sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and games of espionage in other words the film is about a conspiracy undertaken as a response to conspiracies br br marathon man Â 7 9 10 br br the falcon and the snowman Â 8 10 br br aside from an oddly slapstick car crash and its clichÃ©d ending marathon man is an effective thriller with several neat scenes the falcon and the snowman is even better penn turning in a memorable performance

<START> i discovered this late one night on turner classics i kept saying to myself i'll turn it off as soon as it stops being funny but needless to say i watched the whole way through br br i am a movie junkie but i had never even heard of this movie or if i did in 1971 i forgot it's worth watching just for the performance of goldie hawn as the tart tongued ingÃ©nue her acting is a revelation in this movie yes the script is sharp and excellent when was the last time they made a hollywood comedy with a smart script but her acting is extraordinary i never realized how funny goldie could be and it makes her later appearances in roles such as laugh in and private benjamin a little sad in her later career she is far too over the top compared to her minimalist wickedly funny appearance here br br it's a pleasure watching the young matthau the great bergman and the stellar supporting cast but it's goldie hawn that will make this movie worth watching again
<START> there were so many things wrong with this movie i have trouble keeping them all straight but one thing that really bothers me is that if jigsaw was the one laying on the ground in the bathroom what happens if never shows up what if was killed by danny before he made it to the bathroom does jigsaw simply just get up and walk out could the guy in the middle of the bathroom not be jigsaw but another part of game what if killed the wife and kid how does jigsaw get him the antidote for the poison if he's lying in the middle of the bathroom why does the doctor wait till the last minute to finally cut off his foot it was too late it was after six and as far as he knew his wife and child were already shot dead it wasn't the best time for heroics these are just a few questions i had about the film but i may be missing something or everything as i have only seen the movie once please help
<START> this film is about so many things most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic there is also the tense relationship between china and the west as many chinese saw probably rightly so the barbarians as trying to take over and pollute their way of life liu even seeks to preserve their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear their is also liu's internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of china versus the self determination philosophy of the west all these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole by hu a very enjoyable film
<START> add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars it is br br sweet funny and endearing
<START> a raw edgy thriller that aimed for great philosophical heights it couldn't quite attain i did still enjoy the film immensely it had great elements of suspense leaving me with that delightful spine chill i expect from thrillers and it achieved this purely psychologically without resorting to escalating blood and gore the soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly at times it was a bit unpolished particularly the acting and character development it could only have been a better film if we had known more about the nightmares from the past the characters see when they close their eyes and why they felt this desperate need to seek the answer that is so integral to the storyline after all they seemed to continue to seek it despite knowing or at least having an inkling of what might happen when they found it i would recommend seeing this film if you are prepared to look beyond the grit to see the potential of a diamond in the rough
<START> this film gives new meaning to the term uneven giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills br br the plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female that causes death she also may be seducing their sons br br it is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film but unfortunately they're not very convincing particularly the scene where melvyn douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him it's no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible especially the giggling ricky they deliver the worst gee aren't we all drunk scene i've ever watched br br the movie has a few saving graces namely dick smith's great ghost makeups however misplaced they are in this film and alice krige's fascinating performance as alma eva i've never read the novel that this film was taken from but i intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page you don't have to have read the book however to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale there is a good story here but it seems lost somewhere amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share br br as it stands it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print particularly near the climax after all how is it that fred astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly what did gregory bate and the kid have to do with eva and while we're at it what the hell was she anyway why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear if it was an apparition how could it have sex with two men and have them not know br br these and other questions will never be answered at least not by this film unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performances

<START> jim henson's the muppet movie is a charming funny and brilliant film that can be watched and enjoyed by adults and kids i feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters great story and great wit that it is irresistable the plot involves kermit the frog and voiced by henson in his odyssey across america to follow his dream in hollywood along the way he meets fozzie bear the great gonzo my favorite miss piggy rolf and dr teeth and the electric mayhem br br this film has so many good things i can't even say them but it is memorable and every time i think of a puppet or muppet i will think of this film look for cameos from mel brooks dom delouise paul williams madeline kahn bob hope richard pryor steve martin edgar bergen and charlie elliot gould carol kane and the great orson welles excellent and spectacular one of the best films of the 70's a
