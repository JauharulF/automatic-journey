<START> just how exactly do gay asians manage in a culture that generally refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality for millions of gay hindus and muslims there seems little hope of ever leading a life that is accepted and endorsed by their otherwise very close knit families this is the main point explored in chicken masala presumably named after the western spicy dish involving tender pieces of young chicken flesh jimmy is a typical young asian brought up in britain by traditional parents with the common narrow minded and selfish views on marriage and grandchildren like millions of others he is led into an arranged marriage that seems inescapable even though he is apparently completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives he knows that the truth should be told but fears for the consequences of that particularly so as his father appears to be terminally ill and so he becomes embroiled in a web of deceit that becomes wider and wider as the plot develops br br the film is beautifully sensitive and not at all judgmental or patronizing to any group portrayed the acting is generally excellent although it might seem a bit ham in places as the director tends to search for humor rather than letting it blossom naturally there are no prizes for photography or script but the film is made entire by the wonderful sentiment expressed at the very end a sentiment that all fathers across the world would do well to learn from
<START> as far as asian horror goes i have seen my share of disappointments along with some of the creepiest sh t imaginable doesn't really qualify for either of those categories it had a few moments of tension and was interesting to watch yet i couldn't help think that there should have been a tad more to this story the film deals with a childless couple who decide to adopt a kid who appears to have a fascination with trees he develops a bond with the tree in their yard and seems to communicate with it then during a fight with his mother involving their new birth child he storms off after threatening to find his dead mother who is now a tree when he doesn't come back the parents send file a report and wait while the neighbor girl believes he somehow inhabits the tree the pacing is rather slow and the ending gets a bit weird but i have to recommend this as a slightly enjoyable effort though the story feels a little flat hell i can't really make up my mind on this
<START> midnight stars assante simon who stared in the mambo kings and elizabeth bennett alicia milford together with sexy vampire vixen iris simon lures pregnant alicia and her husband charles into the netherworld of midnight assante sinks his fangs into the script by writers brian and jason cleveland and you enjoy watching him and iris kill alicia and charles robert floyd try to stay alive while gore keeps your lust for blood sated br br spoiler alert in today's jaded landscape it comes as no surprise that a back stabbing preacher gets bitten set looks cool Â lots of detail at the hotel and cool special effects at the end i had a lot of fun watching this movie Â it doesn't take itself too seriously and looks great
<START> even though i sat and watched the whole thing i must say it was not good it was all over the place with big chunks of information missing about how things developed and even inaccurate at some bits too if you know nothing about michael you wont understand a thing you have to rely on your current knowledge of the man in order for some bits to make sense acting was a bit dramatic flex alexander looked nothing like michael which was a put off for me and towards the end he literally looked grey saying that portraying michael as somewhat naive but highly positive gentle and loving individual was okay even though they still made a fool out of him time to time if you want to watch mj's life story check out an american dream it is much better but the only thing is it will cover up to bad era i have no doubt that they will eventually make a big budget movie of mj's life story cos michael you rock
<START> dante would of been mortified if he knew that his masterpiece was being acted out puppets also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing no one really will care who the puppet was people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief by this dumb little movie this should be a crime and i cant believe you would ruin a book like that i thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed it totally ruins what your suppose to be getting from reading it your just making it a big joke
<START> this has to be my guilty pleasure i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone this move has no meat not substance no deep thought provoking scenes just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown then so be it this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think viva la nudity
<START> i saw ray when it first came out why partly because of the advertising hype secondly because i just loved the heck outa ray charles's music but not being around when his biggest things in music and his life happened i wanted to learn more about the man's life and in this film i did his addiction to drugs was something i didn't know and the film let us know br br but here's the thing while this was a decent autobiographical film i cannot say it was a great film i've seen malcolm x and was blown away same with what's love got to do with it and bird the performances of each of those films was outstanding i wasn't just drawn into the main characters in those films who did incredible jobs but to those around them as well that helps make a picture to me br br i felt that at some parts of this film was shallow and heavy handed for emotional appeal and yes i'll admit at certain parts of the film i almost fell asleep and the film was too long and the film left out several other important details of ray charles life that would have made the film flow better the film got choppy to me in certain parts and the film seemed to end with a whimper not a bang certain parts including the ending played like a tacked on lifetime cable network movie to me i expect more outa cinema br br so where does my ambivalence come in with jamie foxx's performance overall he did okay not denzel washington's malcolm x or angela tina turner's spectacular but okay br br sorry folks but to me there were several points in the film where i saw jamie foxx's interpretation of ray charles and in others thanks to the wonderful camera angles and lighting he looked like ray charles but i paid attention to the acting an actor has to make you believe he is the character he is playing not make a caricature of the character did i believe jamie foxx was ray on the screen sometimes yes sometimes no br br did jamie foxx deserve a golden globe you betcha does he deserve an oscar depends on who's he's up against he's got a few major competitors there and he might just edge them out but then again maybe not if jamie foxx doesn't win i will not stand up and say he was robbed i wont particularly feel that he had been br br this was a decent film with decent performances and a decent story a great autobiographical film of the late ray charles no somewhere out there i feel there is a great film about ray charles just waiting to be made and an actor that will blow you completely away in doing so
<START> for the sake of propaganda during world war ii sherlock holmes was moved into the then present one of the results is sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starring a top holmes basil rathbone along with nigel bruce lionel atwill dennis and verne it is holmes' assignment to deliver a scientist dr franz william post jr and his weapon design to the british government before the germans can get him once the man reaches england however his troubles are just beginning can holmes decode the message dr left before falling into the hands of the vicious moriarity save the weapon and possibly the scientist too this is an effective holmes story set in the atmosphere of switzerland and blackout england the series worked just fine in the present day it was not without its problems but those problems had nothing to do with the time period whose idea was it to make watson an idiot nigel bruce's characterization aided and abetted by the scripts has always been the false note i much prefer the characterization of edward hardwicke in the jeremy brett sherlock holmes series there he's attractive intelligent and a believable companion for holmes in the rathbone series holmes is often condescending and treats watson like the bumbling fool that he is however in this particular film watson has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts br br i admit to being a complete sap for rathbone's recitation from richard ii this blessed plot this earth this england i can't imagine how much it meant to the brits watching the film in 1942 sherlock holmes really served his purpose
<START> br br it sucked br br i returned the video after watching half of it not funny br br just a cheap and desperate attempt to cash in on a very very funny original junk forget it don't waste your time etc etc
<START> i don't believe it luc is not only a genius now he has always been one this film is for everyone who likes real good deep films just perfect
<START> i once had a conversation with my parents who told me british cinema goers in the 1940s and 50s would check to see a film's country of origin before going to see it it didn't matter what the plot was or who was in it if it was an american movie people would want to see it and if it was british people wouldn't want to see it this might sound like a ridiculous but after seeing the astonished heart i can understand why people in those days preferred american cinema to the home grown variety back in the 1940s br br british equity was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie everyone speaks in an english lad dee upper class accent that makes the british royal family sound like working class scum and what this does is alienate a large amount of a potential british audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching jimmy cagney in white heat because people would have if not related to then certainly empathised with a violent gangster in cinematic terms more than some high class english shrink in 1949 that's entertainment the reason people go to cinemas even the characters names seem bizarre leonora how many british people were named leonora in 1949 and the protagonists drink cocktails and they use words like austere you do get the feeling that this wasn't marketed for a 1949 mainstream british audience but why should it if the majority of british cinema goers were queuing up at cinemas to watch far more entertaining american imports br br watching the heart in 2005 i was astonished how dated everything was in fact it's so dated i thought maybe it might be a spoof from the harry show what didn't astonish me was the fact that these types of movie came close to sinking the british film industry an industry that didn't pick up until american money invested in crowd pleasers like zulu alfie and the james bond movies
<START> in a farcical key afternoons can be taken as a mediocre exercise marcia gay harden and judy davis a good cast juliette lewis' new age freaky character has been incredibly taken from reality i know an american young lady who squawks like her but ga does not show much beyond its plot br br even though movie making is all about make believe there were certain noticeable screenplay inconsistencies two samples you pay 14 euro to enter the chapel where cassandra and frankie met never at 7 am and you cannot leave a terrace without paying the bill they'll charge you on the spot if they don't know you or get off a taxi that quickly you americans always tip even though they don't expect to but the sequences portrayed in the movie were ridiculous don't believe me reader come over and see for yourself br br if you've never been here before you might not care about all this but good movies should be believable disregarding of your origin nobody knows about ga here and i will make sure that does not change in the future
<START> as the superb prime suspect' series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all this in itself a considerable achievement ' prime suspect iv the lost child' has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these british dramas but of course the beautiful helen mirren easily dominates our eyes never leave her while she's on screen br br the search for the lost child of the title leads superintendent jane cid team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters the insight we are given into the workings of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini series but it may be too strong for many stomachs br br the action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand held camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and there's gripping tension during the climactic siege br br altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama
