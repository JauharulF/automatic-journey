<START> wow here is another great golf movie that's at least three in the past few years that i've really enjoyed that were well done beautifully filmed and inspirational the other two were bobby jones stroke of genius and the legend of bagger vance br br this is a true underdog story if there ever was one to have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the united states open golf tournament is an unheard of feat i believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished how much of this film is fiction embellished for dramatic effect i don't know i do know that i plan on reading the book and i know that in real life francis had a three stroke lead in with just two holes to go unlike what we saw in the film br br whatever francis victory over golf legends harry and ted ray is fact it is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here it isn't something just for golf fans this is a fun movie to actor turned director bill paxton for an outstanding job br br yes a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him it's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance the movie also deals with demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an sport which it was at the time for both europeans and americans br br shia labeouf is winsome as as is steven as for those who don't know was like the tiger woods of his day maybe even more unbeatable in the film is pictured as a warm nice guy a genuine human being the other major competitor ray stephen marcus is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy br br the fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film a fifth grade boy who winds up being caddie in the open he josh flitter brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie br br if all of this a with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole were not true you would think oh man this is so hokey who could believe this that's what makes this true life story fun to see finally captured on film as with another sports film of 2005 cinderella man here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards i guess nice films don't win awards just the hearts of their viewers
<START> i think this is a great classic monster film for the family the mole what a machine the tall creature with the beak the flying green lizards or whatever they are and the ape men things the speak telepathically with them the battle of the men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast umm yummy class what else can i say how would they make a 2002 remake of this one
<START> plot none script a string of cliches acting not in evidence special effects title sequence kind of cool but otherwise exceptionally poor fright factor crossing the road is scarier cult factor only the most desperate cult would latch onto this dog can't you say anything positive i did the titles were kind of cool br br special bonus question your idea of hell being at a party with people who voted this flop a 7
<START> the turner classic movie channel has spent the month of january doing the films of one of my favorite actors robert montgomery his films are mostly rarely watched these days except for those that were atypical for most of his career meaning that the roles that frequently reappear on television are they were expendable the lady in the lake june bride night must fall the saxon charm ride the pink horse rage in heaven the earl of chicago in short the films he fought to get the roles in because they were not the usual comic fluff he usually appeared in it's ironic that nowadays when one thinks of montgomery's career it is the films that were mostly made after 1937 that are pushed the ones that broke the original image that mgm and louis b mayer pushed the pity of this is that montgomery was a gifted comedian and saved many films from being routine br br petticoat fever is one such film made in 1936 with jim and trouble for two it was a banner year of good performances by montgomery and helped lead to his being able to convince the powers that be at mgm to allow him to play danny in night must fall the next year br br petticoat fever is set in labrador and montgomery is a weather station operator there named he has been living there for five years and has not been in the company of a woman except for inuit women for most of that time he has a girlfriend of sorts named clara winifred who he sort of proposed to but it's been two years since he has heard from her so that he believes she has given up on him br br world is rocked when sir james felton and irene reginald owen and myrna loy show up they were flying to toronto for a business meeting that felton was to address felton is engaged to but finds her enchanting and gradually she finds him equally attractive certainly the pompous self important and hopelessly inept felton is no competition it is a measure of owen's acting that he keeps the character entertaining even if one finds it hard to believe such a boob is a canadian captain of industry br br there is something surreal about this film probably due to the original play while the labrador scenery is quite phony looking it does serve it's purpose for the comedy witness th polar bear sequence but the height of the surrealism is the dinner serves his guests a dinner of which owen eats with real gusto owen a minor noble as a is dressed in normal clothing a winter suit for the climate but montgomery is dressed in his suit of evening dress as though attending a ball at the embassy loy seeing him dress up likewise puts on a gown they are being served by servant assistant the inuit otto who is wearing a suit of evening dress too it turns out that it is owen's owen who earlier insisted that change into clothing more suitable to his station is the only person who is improperly dressed for this dinner montgomery was mgm's most elegant actor in a tuxedo or evening dress franchot tone was the his closest rival it is a toss up in movie if montgomery or fred astaire was the more elegant figure in such suits hard to decide br br the course of love does not move smoothly in comedy or drama clara shows up we are tipped off too early about this at the start of the film when we see her on an ship will break with clara will irene break with felton the film is funny and loy and montgomery make a nice couple they had appeared together in one other film and both were in separate scenes in a second before this movie but this would be their last film together br br one last interesting point at the start of the film when the credits are shown you see illustrations of men and women in comic situations they are based on the art work of john held jr the great cartoonist illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s who was the recorder of the flapper and jazz age it's an unusual choice as it has absolutely nothing to do with the film's plot or labrador
<START> quai des directed by the brilliant henri georges clouzot is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of french film making of the postwar years m clouzot adapting the novel longtime defence shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that as has pointed out in this forum it demonstrates how influential was and how much the next generation of french movie makers are indebted to the master especially claude chabrol br br the crisp black and white cinematography by armand has been magnificently transferred to the criterion dvd we recently watched working with clouzot makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes the music by francis lopez a man who created light music and in france works well in the context of the film since the action takes place in the world of the music halls and night clubs br br louis jouvet who is seen as a police detective is perfect in the part this was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a pillar of the french theater jouvet clearly understood well the mechanics for the creation of his police inspector who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others in an unfair comment by someone in this page jouvet's inspector is compared with peter falk's columbo the television detective frankly and no disrespect to mr falk intended it's like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine br br bernard blier is perfect as the jealous husband blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife jenny lamour has awakened in him martineau is vulnerable and doesn't act rationally he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didn't commit but all the evidence points to the contrary br br the other great character in the film is dora the photographer it's clear by the way she interacts with jenny where her real interest lies simone is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film suzy playing jenny is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like the old lecher br br the film is one of the best clouzot directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together
<START> this is a disappointing adaptation of the james lee burke novel in the electric mist of the confederate dead it is rather poorly acted mainly due to the miscasting of the principal players tommy lee jones a normally fine actor just doesn't capture burke's dave as main nemesis john goodman does a sloppy job as the heavy the guy who plays actor buddy doesn't look like a former a lister leading man the rest of the movie is mainly cast with no name locals who just don't do justice to a big time novel br br the movie and jones' performance is way too hurried for one thing in burke's series of novels gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time being laid back and slow moving this is just like the deep south and southern louisiana then at times is nearly manic in his jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie he doesn't vary ned beatty is wasted mary steenburgen is out of place about the only good thing about this is the setting on the whole the movie gives one the impression of a tv movie
<START> i watched this movie having never read the book and took the characters at face value but having already been introduced to them watched it again recently i got a whole different viewpoint out of the film br br without the burden of having to focus intently on each character learning their quirks and foibles allowed me to focus on the cultural issues laid out in the film the farm families of iowa are so intimately inter related as they are in the area of indiana where i grew up in the 40's and 50's that i immediately recognized the back stories and motives behind the characters perhaps jane smiley did mean for us to see beyond the superficial into the world these people had to live but viewers are so caught up in the hollywood aura of the individual actors that they miss a rich layout of a lifestyle that exists less and less as each decade passes another film with these characteristics is the bridges of madison county try watching both of these films again with an eye to the whole picture
<START> susan sarandon she made this movie for me i've never appreciated her acting more than as i did in this movie she really acted as though she were adele august i can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable br br natalie portman as ann august helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie the movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral br br i gave this movie an eight rating but susan received a ten from me because of her performance as far as relationship movies go beaches and terms of endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie but i highly recommend it
<START> come on now how did all of these talented actors actresses end up in this mess was it some sort of blackmail lost bet situation vinnie you are a muscle man be what you were born to be br br the hot tub scene the scrabble scene i was expecting to hear the needle dragging over the record sound at any point br br and what was up with him carrying around the priceless dickens manuscript with him let's see i'm drunk at a bar why not pull out the priceless dickens manuscript i'm going to meet some questionable thugs down on the edge of the thames why not take my priceless dickens manuscript br br crapola br br terrible avoid
<START> troma founder lloyd kaufman is the in this anthology film made up of two films that were such celluloid feces that tried to salvage them by combining the two into one anthology film and throwing in copious amounts of nudity whenever possible does it work nope it's still crap that i'd have to scrape off my boots if i stepped in it will anyone like this mess sure young teen aged mongoloids with the combined iqs of a vienna sausage have to laugh at something i guess for those who have brains that are even semi functioning steer clear though and watch something less insulting to your intelligence even dude where's my car would do br br my grade f
<START> a quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred backwood slash fest the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die however delivers considerably more br br rather than focus on bare flesh and gore though there is a little of each no sex however the flick focuses on delivering impending dread mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop these feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil oh yeah george kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing br br if you liked wrong turn then watch this to see where much of its' methodology came from
<START> okul is the first of its kind in turkish cinema and it's way better than i expected those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point it's not all that great indeed but it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur so it's basically a maiden voyage and comparing this one to other films such as the 1st class garbage propaganda this movie is pretty damn good br br one thing that must be said it deals with the highschool students' life in turkey very realistically that's exactly how it goes the scenes that are meant to scare are somewhat cheap and hollywoodish most of them even if not all but that religion lesson scene made me laugh in tears and performs the best acting of this flick as a religion teacher br br it's not a waste of your time go and watch it you'll find it rather amusing especially if you know turkey enough to relate to turkish school lives
<START> this is a voice of a person who just finished watching the second season of rome almost at one go and grabbed the opportunity to see what happened next this film conveniently takes off where rome ends if you find rome an abomination a foul mouthed screw fest of little historical accuracy then you might enjoy augustus but if you feel rome is a good thing if you enjoy the complicated intrigue the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors then will obviously appear to you as an overly timid superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors br br there are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in rome i especially disliked image of cleopatra as a drug soaked sex addict there must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman and the actress in suits the part much better o'toole and rampling are good and so are some others but then if you have come to know and love as the super cool bitch you'll find the depiction of her in as a tear jerking mother goose in an apron absolutely ridiculous there are supposed to be some bitchy characters in but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more you'll find no interesting female characters in this epic there's also the painfully comic whom we see as a screeching drag queen even though there is little historical evidence that he was such he's once referred to as being effeminate in his pleasures in the annals br br the interiors are rather meager and rely on clichÃ©s upon clichÃ©s big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children's play room in an egyptian theme park there's a of really poor 3d graphics not up to 2003 standards br br the action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged augustus is reliving so we get a quick look at some historical events some of which are presented well whereas some are not an amount of time is wasted to show livia as the eternal flame of augustus this affair doesn't sizzle for even a moment the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear inducing musical score whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing most of the actors are non english speakers br br everything is lukewarm in this epic true there are more historical accuracies than in rome but dramatically speaking it's plain boring the characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness camera work is often reduced to static shots and lighting offers nothing to please your eye br br there's really no one to love and no one to hate in regardless of whether you liked or disliked rome there are much better films and miniseries around ancient rome the rise and fall of an empire would be one thing i recommend
<START> this movie really sucks sucks really really hard this movie should be in the bottom 100 but it is so bad that almost nobody has seen it to vote for her so many times that it should be at the same time of manos the hands of fate i should have him position 1 awful but the reason for which i put him 2 was for eve the girl of the town that besides some scenes of nudity besides i thought of voting for 3 but like they killed eve i returned at 2 it is that movies like this they should not be financed by anybody since not even they took to the fame or other productions to the actors main great falsehood jaja the history of a mining ghost that kills to and after they put an end to their misdeeds it reappears because with the end they it very ugly br br final score vote 2 for the nudity and the performance of the beautiful eve
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i could hardly stay awake the acting and the plot were horrible i like b movies but this movie has nothing that could make me laugh or think about ok there were two or three funny moments at the beginning so i have to give this movie 2 out of 10 if you really want to watch it watch the first 10 minutes after that you will get more and more disappointed while the movie runs
