<START> this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in abbott and costello meet it was a somewhat desparate yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man frankenstein's monster and dracula one last time br br i say desparate because in the previous film house of frankenstein both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the sunlight and the wolf man by a silver bullet yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn't be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein and if the wolf man didn't get cured then there'd be no plot holes but since this is not the case the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense br br however ignoring these plot holes house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch it has many high points especially seeing the wolf man get cured i know i just said that this shouldn't have been included but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time and the scene with the lady playing moonlight on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula's spell was very eerie dr transformation into the dr mr hyde type character was also done very well br br and it's great to see dracula frankenstein and the wolf man together one last time br br out of
<START> the andrew davies adaptation of the sarah waters' novel was excellent the characters of nan and and kitty were superbly portrayed by rachael stirling and kelley hawes respectively the whole series was a total joy to watch it caught the imagination of everyone across the board whether straight or gay i wish there could be a sequel
<START> i liked this movie i wasn't really sure what it was about before i started watching it but enjoyed it nonetheless it was about a girl meredith monroe whose mom didn't want her to turn out like she did she meets and falls in love with a boy riley smith who is town for a charity football game it's a good movie i just hope it will be on again or comes out on video
<START> i'm 15 usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies but this is one of my favorites i was totally addicted after watching it for the first time it's really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time music is great storyline is ok choreography is great must see it i don't know why there's a prequel for this movie not many people like this movie but i love classic love movies they're so much better than movies now this movie will make you smile cry and make you start dancing the music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful i haven't seen dirty dancing 2 nights prequel prequel should have star the original actors thats what i hate about prequels they ruin the original no one wants a prequel they want a sequel many people will agree that for a movie the original sequel and the 3rd one is enough beyond that people wont be bothered to watch it who remembers the movie about the st benard beethoven i think there's 5 movies altogether
<START> it's reassuring to see that other imdb reviewers have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film at the risk of against the great malle and fellini br br these directors may be talented artistic in their own right however in attempting to pass off this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and 60s chic as in any way related to edgar allen poe's stories they exposed themselves as frauds either a they didn't bother to read the poe stories or b they read them but were so transfixed by their own egotistical agenda that they didn't pay poe any mind br br imagine if metallica plugged in their guitars cranked the amps up to 11 and out 3 chords claiming it to be beethoven's 9th symphony that's the feeling you'll get after sitting through this film if you're a malle fellini fan metallica you'll dig it if you're a beethoven fan poe you'll puke br br br br here we begin with a bizarre porno version of poe ok porno may be a bit extreme haha but at the very least you have to call it a barbarella version including i don't doubt some of jane's outfits coming directly from the set of that scifi romp falls into old clichÃ©s of his own the girl lying on a bed being pleasured by some man whilst from the pillow cam we see the apathy in her eyes the general and ennui of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism cute stuff but ain't the place for it and in addition to the barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes jane fonda's awful american accent and unconvincing performance as a european countess made this the worst casting since julia roberts in that lousy version of dr jekyll mr hyde br br william wilson br br here's a great poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world if you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme go watch star trek episode 27 the alternative factor but here malle over that central theme and instead focuses on any guesses yup eroticism sadism and debauchery ho hum brigitte role is a complete fabrication to accomplish that end and once again the director distorts a classic poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual issues do it on your own time malle i thought we're here on poe's dime br br toby dammit br br the absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst film i've seen since staying alive at least fellini showed some tact in changing the title but his departure from the original plot theme and humour of the story is so vast i wonder if he just picked this reel out of his private collection of home movies stamped edgar allen poe story on it and submitted it to this collection i strained very hard to find any thread of familiarity with poe's works but there was absolutely none br br the original poe story never bet the devil your head is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims i'll bet the devil my head on a foggy morning the devil takes him up on his offer the result is the sickest and silliest thing you've ever read this was poe the comedian at his finest yes poe wrote many comedies also check out a predicament and devil in the if you want a taste of his witty satirical works br br this fellini version it's bland soulless and not funny at all unless you consider it funny to see a drunk stumbling over himself for 45 minutes here fellini's egotistical rant is about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy pretense and mediocrity of cinema most of it is set at an awards ceremony where fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm cynicism and that classic sour grapes attitude that we find in all fellini films dealing with cinema note the sarcastic jabs at the critics a recurring theme in fellini's films for someone who considered himself above the critics fellini sure spent a lot of time talking about them at any rate i feel like fellini just took some outtakes from 8 1 2 spliced them together and sold it as a poe story worst adaptation ever br br i think i put more effort into typing this review than any of the three directors put into making a poe movie
<START> eddie murphy put a lot into this movie by directed wrote starred and produced this story about two owners in the 30s who try to fight mobsters and corrupt cops from taking over their club a great cast in murphy redd foxx richard pryor danny aiello della reese and a gorgeous jasmine guy that would make it worth seeing on its own but the story just doesnt hold up interest or give the great cast enough to work with on a scale of one to ten a 4
<START> i was looking at the external reviews ebert etc for this film and they were all pretty much negative however after reading many of them i noticed that they all made the same point critics were upset that the film centers around what appears to be a senseless murder of an autistic child certainly this is a disturbing image critics like ebert want a traditional detective story that uncovers why the killing happened and squarely places blame on the guilty they want blame to be cast and resolved well that status quo theme is kind of what the movie is parodying just like society the critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to their next tragic opera perhaps there is no simple question to be answered here there is a whole lot more to what happened then what is on the surface the film does not seek to rationalize what happens but rather understand the why what also steams me so much about these inane reviews is that all they look at in the way of performances is spacey and cheadle who were both great and generally are but there are other great performances at work here other than just the two current icons of hollywood gosling gives an incredible performance that really only somebody of his extreme talent could deliver somehow gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child sympathetic this irritates many i am sure however if one watches the film they see what motivation is it is wrong but it is not evil malone is also on top of her game as yet another confused young character basically the killing of the child in this film is not the main theme of the movie the main theme is life itself and how people go about dealing with it the highs and lows and how they attempt to sometimes help others deal with their lives which does not seem to work out very well there is a lot of good and bad in this world and how we handle each has direct impact on how much more good and bad will take place and sometimes a confused attempt at doing good can lead to a whole bunch more of bad i think this is one of the more memorable films in sometime and has an ending that is as touching as anything in recent movie history i strongly believe people should view this film with an open mind
<START> a blatant rip off of air bud this movie is really about parents worrying too much about parenting all the foibles of the characters eg adult coaches who dont know the game are taken to the extreme so much so that they are totally unbelievable not funny br br there is no semblance of reality here folks and you'll not develop sympathy for any of the characters br br the best thing about the movie is the good looking kits uniforms of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays perhaps chosen because the setting is supposedly near arlington heights il the home of the columbus crew's franchise player brian mcbride
<START> wow i think the overall average rating of this film on this site is incredibly low there's really no reason to dislike this film michael is a simple but fairly original and easily enjoyable romantic comedy the plot involves a group of reporters experts going to examine the mysterious appearance of an angel john travolta in the midwest the angel proves to be less saintly and more worldly than we would expect and that's what makes it entertaining his interest in women and the beatles takes a new spin on the angel thing the romantic side of this film involves michael the angel trying to get andie macdowell and william hurt together the two of them may not have the all time greatest on screen chemistry but they certainly have enough to make it work well everyone who has rated this film so low a 5 4 come on the film is not that bad in fact i found it quite funny and memorable sure it's not the best thing you'll ever see but it's still good this is a film i feel has been remarkably underrated it's fun romantic and recommended by me br br out of
<START> you don't see the meaning of the title till much later but you get the point of it in the first few minutes this directorial debut from golden globe nominated for actor danny devito also playing owen ned 'little lift is a terrific hitchcock like film about one man's hate for his wife's book she stole his and one man's hate for his mother basically owen wants to be a good writer like his teacher larry donner billy crystal and he inspired by murder stories larry suggests he see a hitchcock film quite ironic and that is when owen has the idea to kill larry's ex wife margaret star trek voyager's kate mulgrew owen is inspired by on a train' swapping murders so larry must kill owen's horrible momma oscar and golden globe nominated anne ramsey larry was convinced owen killed margaret and also that he had to wanted to kill owen's momma but there is a happy ending when months later both larry and owen bring out books momma died naturally and they went on a holiday with beth ryan kim greist also starring rob reiner as joel and oprah winfrey with hilarious moments a great director actor and his support this is a must see comedy very very good
<START> when i went to the cinema i expected not much i knew nothing about this movie but it was the only movie i could see 'cause i was in a small town then so i saw this movie and i was fascinated la che non is a trip through the new industrial china and it shows it honestly you see most of the time the ugly places of china and you see what really happens with this new the main characters are sad but hopefully people he's the naive italian guy who can't believe what he see's she's a translator from china who's missing her son sometimes sad sometimes funny but every time poetic a wonderful movie with wonderful actors so only one star is missing
<START> this movie reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s not like the recent which seemed more of a stunt than anything else but a true moral drama that is both engaging and thought provoking anne heche is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior played by sam shepard and eric stoltz is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment i found myself waiting for their affair to begin if only because they look so good together this movie is apparently based on a true story and it's a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change br br directed by christopher who also did the passion of ayn rand with stolz and the prime suspect series this is a movie with panache and style and is absolutely worth seeing
<START> i went into this movie with low expectations knowing uwe boll's legacy as a film director and screenplay writer and i was still disappointed uwe boll finds a way to make each and every movie he is involved in worse and worse the overall concept wasn't a bad one a man bored with his life as a stock broker becomes a serial killer but the problem with the movie is there is no in between he goes straight from stock broker to serial killer the film has no name actors and i can see why after watching the movie i can't see why any actor with a career would want to even be involved in this movie anyone who turned it down did their careers a favor and if you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and don't br br i give a 3 out of 10
<START> the game was made in 1996 but it is still good today the graphics is not that hot and the actors are not oscar worthy but the plot is twisted diabolic and highly enjoyable the dark story is compelling from the first film and is continuing throughout all the play we played several people together for several reasons 1 to use all our minds together 2 not to be so afraid br br play this game and you won't regret this just don't try to find a quake engine in there
<START> i've been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80's i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i'm not particularly interested in the dialogue is and philosophical making sense no doubt only to it's franco italian producers and the plot completely extraneous what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful philippines soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile
