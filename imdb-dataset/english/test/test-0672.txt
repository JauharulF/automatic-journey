<START> a labor of love each frame is picture perfect and grabs you then the sheer emotion and story telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie the director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters i have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing at every showing the remarkable story telling transcends nationality and language and i felt i was a part of the drama unfolding before me the casting is as perfect as one can get vijay camille and benoit each hold their own br br i strongly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates good cinema i can't wait for the commercial release of this movie
<START> when i first heard about this movie i eagerly went out to rent it believing mistakenly that it was one of those so bad it's fun movies and that i was in for a treat i was wrong br br for starters the pace is agonizingly mind numbingly slow the pace doesn't even begin to pick up until the last 15 20 minutes of the movie the plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing for those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwise br br try child's play instead
<START> i've always loved horror flicks from some of the usual well known like the exorcist to some of the more underrated like black christmas or just before dawn but who are people kidding even calling this trash a b movie it's straight up bottom of the barrel z grade the acting is the worst ever on film really i've seen better on an episode of the young and the restless spoiler lookout for when the woman comes to tell them about the legend of jack o she pauses sometimes for a matter of seconds as if someone is flashing her cue cards and she's struggling to read her lines a riot br br oh and besides the bad acting absolutely no gore or f x and jack o looked like a plastic lit pumpkin watch linnea quigley in night of the demons or silent night deadly night far superior flicks
<START> ok where to start i can't believe how many good reviews i read on here i watched this year 2004 and i had to fight to not push the stop button i decided to continue just because of all the good reviews i read after watching it i felt it was my duty to let the world know about this first of all the movie seems like it is never going to begin the plotline doesn't actually occur until about 30 minutes before the movie ends leaving the viewer wondering when is this going to so don't ever call this a revenge movie' because the revenge doesn't even start until over half the movie is already gone by furthermore the movie tries to make you believe this is a post apocalyptic australia i am sorry if showing dusty rural roads half the movie and a crooked letter on a sign didn't quite convince me of that even for 1979 this was not science fiction so anyways add this on top of randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you have got yourself one crappy movie i have nothing against gays there was just no need for it the only good part was the first chase scene good directing considering it was 1979 and another good part is how he kills the last guy so basically i recommend you watch the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes and you will enjoy yourself much more than if you sat through all that stuff in the middle which may lead you to gouge your own eyes out don't say i didn't warn you
<START> i saw this movie last night at the film festival it was an interesting and funny movie that had some endearing and moving scenes peter falk was excellent as was the rest of cast they were believable and played their roles well the movie may have gone a bit long and the conclusion was okay the audience laughed at the right places the family dynamics were terrific and though this was a jewish family they could have been italian irish or any other including greek i recommend this film if you are interested in laughing at a subject that isn't often handled that way makes you think about the of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those who are not clearly in your life
<START> this show is just plain awful i liked to watch drake and josh which was great and before that the amanda show also funny but this is just awful in my opinion watching this felt like watching those movies from painful and this is about 3 dumb kids who make a crappy web show while stealing the hole while their retarded brother is making sculptures he has no life the cast is crap megan from drake and josh is carly ahhhhhh a ugly b tch is sam and some kid they pulled off the street plays fred all i saw from this are random jokes that include the brother making a clay film he also played an arcade game called rat genious sam and carly being retards on their web show and fred being a dork the only episode a saw cant remember the title where fred gets bad luck by not an email i find videos on youtube funnier than this junk and why the hell do they get youtube jack fred get to cancel the show with his potty mouth just skip this show
<START> every once in a while an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can't miss but the movie sucks some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are levity and the safety of objects and now here's the united states of leland br br said awesome cast includes ryan gosling kevin spacey don cheadle jena malone lena olin michelle williams chris klein and kerry washington gosling plays leland p fitzgerald the teenage son of a famous author spacey who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime murdering a retarded child but doesn't remember it and doesn't seem to have any sort of motive br br don cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand leland and also exploit him by writing a book about him and jena malone is his ex girlfriend we see their deteriorating relationship due to her heroin addiction in flashback sounds like an awesome little drama huh i thought so too br br the fact is that this movie is just badly badly written the dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating platitudes about life the characters are all two dimensional indie cliches and while it does manage to make leland sympathetic in some ways it glosses over his crime br br for the most part there's no problem with the acting gosling who was oscar worthy in the believer is a tremendously talented young actor but the way they're written none of these characters least of all leland even feel like real people so there's not much he can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad br br jena malone is the most memorable she has one of the most expressive faces i've ever seen even playing an underwritten character in a bad movie like this she can break your heart with one look when she's got good material to work with as in donnie darko or the dangerous lives of altar boys she's really amazing br br but this is not good material maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile but as it is the united states of leland is ponderous inert and for a movie that seems in love with how deep it is it's really shallow
<START> who in india is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film making has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good without offering much food for thought forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art br br while i would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots does not contain lingering effects afterward and mostly contain ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama seen profusely in indian movies br br overall has successfully confirmed my distaste for his films once again br br sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise my suggestion to you watch some beautiful cinemas made around the globe
<START> the story in this movie is fairly implausible b grade stuff but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead and in 1940 that meant peter lorre and peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner stephen who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine upon arrival the discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of br br only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves wife and monkeys monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get br br lorre is perfect in his role here and creeps up the screen in industrial strength fashion although the script is not casablanca caliber the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes this is a very watchable story but i'm not sure what niche this movie filled too long for a short subject and too short for a feature length film i'm not sure how this was marketed to theaters br br i just caught this for the first time on a late night early morning tcm showing lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven't seen it
<START> i love to see a female protagonist in this movie her name was rose rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means does our society teach this can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others is one responsible for being a product of one's environment to what extent can one control or take control of one's environment how is a typical human alike or different than rose lastly would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like france or italy i loved that this movie provoked all of these questions in me while it entertained stimulated and kept me guessing to the end every time i've watched it i have learned more about the film and myself
<START> i have seen this movie when it was released and no doubt it is heart touching i liked the point of view of a kid who came to know that what she was thinking about her were actually not true it's a shatter to that small kid and her search to find out who she is and before and after she knows about her the relationship between her and her foster mom that's a nice view a r rahman adds his stress by a good re recording and songs in this movie mani does not exaggerate or give advices like in but simply narrates the characters as they are and because of that the film exactly strikes the audience the pool bath scene of and did not convey perfectly what it meant for mani has amazingly improved
<START> 2001 is one of those movies where if you don't like it you are told that you don't 'get it' and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism you're told that you clearly have a slow attention span and just want to see sex explosions and have the plot handed to you on a platter br br let's break down the movie shall we three minutes of blackness with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background then we get the opening credits a minute of fascinating shots of the savannah then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones cut to the first of many 20 minute shots of ships doing things while the 'blue danube' plays in the background a bunch of pointless dialogue and a group of moon scientists find another monolith br br cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew complement three sleeping people two people named dave and frank who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation and then there's hal the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship predictably he snaps and starts breaking the first law of robotics now this is something that has potential an evil coldly ruthless super mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move and what does he do he lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die leaving dave floating in a pod he simply uses the airlock puts on a spacesuit and turns hal off agonizingly slowly then apparently there's some psychedelic at jupiter br br here's the movie with the pauses taken out apes see monolith kill things scientists find moon monolith hal kills people hal dies dave gets a message and evolves at jupiter br br this is not me 'not getting it ' this is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing sure it's realistic but i find i have no reason to care no matter the message no movie can be good without being entertaining frankly every character could be replaced with keanu reeves and nothing would change
<START> i couldn't believe how bad this film was and trust me i was not expecting a masterpiece from a made for cable film i taped it just because i liked jane seymour i've seen her enough to know that she is certainly an accomplished actress so i just don't know what happened here the characters were shallow the dialog stilted the acting bad and yes that includes seymour it was nice seeing her play against type but not in something this bad i noticed that she carried a credit for executive producer so she cannot escape blame for the sheer badness of this film and oh yeah they had barry bostwick playing the male lead 'nuff said
<START> this is just one of those movies that continually make you groan and that i wished was over the problems are many and the good points are few i feel the main problem with this movie is that it has what amounts to a cheesy plot and they try to make it out to be a epic movie which a movie about super evil monkeys and smart ones that sign just is not epic it is cheese when you have cheese you make the movie more fun granted the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to watch and more of things of that nature was needed instead the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel the movie just has a corny plot amid all the serious tension the movie is trying to set up the plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her missing ex husband while also searching for some sort of legendary diamonds she uses these two guys who trained an ape to do sign language and now wish to return her to the wild as cover to get into the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime the only things that make this movie somewhat tolerable is ernie hudson's character and the laser attack at the end
<START> possible spoilers as peter jackson has so brilliantly shown in his lord of the rings' trilogy it is quite possible to make good films even great ones within the heroic fantasy genre the genre has distinguished literary antecedents dating back to the mediaeval romances particularly the arthurian legends upon which tolkien and other authors have drawn lord of the rings' apart however it is difficult to think of any other sword and sorcery films which are any good i would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was ron howard's and even that achieved little distinction other than that of being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad one red however cannot achieve the even more modest distinction of being simply a bad film as opposed to an appalling one br br as with many of the plot elements in red are derived from the lord of the rings' an evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artefact with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition of world domination but is thwarted by an assorted group of heroes the film set in the age a barbaric era in the earth's remote past starts with the villain of the piece the wicked queen making unwelcome sexual advances to the heroine sonja when these are rebuffed not a woman to take no for an answer reacts by murdering sonja's parents and brother in 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the chief villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives for her villainy frustrated lesbian lust br br next move is to capture the talisman a sort of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers by slaughtering the whole of the scantily dressed female priesthood charged with protecting it just as they are about to destroy it because they feel its powers have become too dangerous among the dead is sonja's sister her sole surviving relative sonja herself however has not been idle but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduates summa cum laude and sets out to avenge herself along the way she teams up with a heroic wandering swordsman king resembling tolkien's aragorn prince the spoilt child ruler of a kingdom that has fallen to powers and loyal servant the rest of the film is fairly predictable as sonja and her allies try to overthrow and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out of control talisman br br just what is it that makes this film so bad well the acting for a start arnold schwarzenegger as gives the sort of typical wooden poker faced performance that became his trademark at least in the early part of his career complete with heavy foreign accent compared with brigitte nielsen as the heroine however he looks like laurence olivier miss nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties delivering every line in the mechanical voice of someone who has just completed lesson three of a teach yourself english by course one wonders if she was hired for the role just to make arnie look good by comparison the other characters while not conducting their own private struggles against the english language are simply cartoonish caricatures especially prince who must be one of the most obnoxious screen youngsters ever br br an even worse fault than the bad acting however is the film's almost complete lack of imagination this is a particularly glaring fault in a fantasy film as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power in order to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be provoked by a fantastic plot when we watch peter jackson's masterpiece we can persuade ourselves at least for the next three hours that we are in middle earth that elves wizards and hobbits do exist and that the fate of the world really does depend upon the destruction of a magic ring when we watch red we are persuaded of nothing except that we are watching a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting one another on a hillside for possession of a lime green football br br this lack of imagination even starts with the film's title the british science fiction author brian aldiss when challenged about the exotic names given to his characters replied that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero joe admittedly tolkien was able br br to get away with giving the name sam to one of his main characters but that was because hobbits were supposed to be reassuringly familiar the middle earth equivalent of tweedy pipe smoking englishmen similarly giving the heroine of a tale ostensibly set in a long gone barbaric age a common girls' name like which is how the name is pronounced is about as appropriate as calling her betty' or mary jane' br br the film seems to have been made on a very small budget which makes me wonder why they bothered at all fantasy needs to be done convincingly or not at all it was obviously shot in a remote mountain area with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture the few buildings we see such as the temple of the talisman or palace are obviously cheap sets we learn that capital city has been destroyed by using the power of the talisman but we do not actually see this event all we see is what might be a thunderstorm taking place on the other side of a hill at first you wonder how sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies but when you see how small an army has at her disposal it becomes more understandable when an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace you wonder if this is the talisman at work or merely a crew member inadvertently leaning against the set if we can enjoy this film for nothing else we can at least enjoy it for its inadvertent humour a fine example of the so bad it's funny school of filmmaking ed wood would have been proud of this one if it had been shown on californian television the night before the recall election gray davis would still be governor 2 10
