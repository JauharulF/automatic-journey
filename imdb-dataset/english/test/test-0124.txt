<START> now i know why this movie can be bought for so cheap at the video stores i was curious since it had three big name stars yet was among the 'b' movies that the video apparently can't even give away the answer is it is a film that would attract a very limited audience an over 50 crowd with very liberal sensibilities br br who else who watch robert redford willem dafoe and helen mirren give essentially a basic message that cheating on your wife is okay so long as you still love her that's the nice feel good message here particularly at the end at the end of this strange kidnapping story who wrote this script bill clinton br br i say strange because the kidnapper is the nicest kidnapper dafoe you've ever seen except at the end he his hostage redford frequently which no kidnapper would risk has casual conversations about family matters etc it's all ludicrous well the l a times says it's an intelligent thriller ha ha well that confirms what most people know of the l a times for those of you who believe that and haven't seen it i won't spoil it with more of the gigantic holes in this story particularly at the end the fact is it's an insult to anyone with intelligence br br anyway you can't fool all the people all the time as critics have yet to figure out here is another film they touted that justifiably bombed at the box office and video store
<START> okay so i'm singaporean and i would like to say that it's time to stop stereotyping singaporeans and making such films some of the actors actresses actually have talent but sadly it wasn't shown much in this film i was fidgeting in my seat when i watched this being quite young at that time my parents dragged me along to see it honestly i could say that i was going to fall asleep and there was this arrogant westernized boy whom just got on my nerves overall a boring film and a general waste of the actors' talent i have seen better singaporean movies than this chicken rice war was good however i cannot believe that this one would be considered a better singaporean film sorry i wouldn't recommend it
<START> i love this movie first and foremost because of mark wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means there is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling jen aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie it takes a look at the rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day perhaps these days they have gotten just smarter it takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through like a diamond this movie shines you won't waste your popcorn on this one semi chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too there's some laughs thrown in too
<START> china white 1989 was ronny yu's first international film this u k holland hong kong production was shot in english and was slightly edited for the western audience the american wong brothers michael and russell were supposed to star in the film together but due to prior commitments was unavailable so another western actor steven leigh took his spot several hong kong stars such as tommy wong playing a mute and the always creepy william ho appear as well as the director in an interesting cameo spot br br the chow brothers are in holland to run the family business they want to the family business to go legit but the other asian gangs don't want to and see there move as a face saving move to please the foreigners and want to keep on making money the old fashion way others want to take their business to even a new low by smuggling drugs and what not after the chow elder is gunned down in cold blood the brothers make their move against any family who's not with them can the chow family keep the families from killing one another or while the streets of holland flow with the blood of the innocence and gangsters br br a highly underrated movie i was surprised by how good it was i haven't seen the hong kong version that would be a huge treat for me it's longer and has a lot more stars of the hong kong cinema involved with the production too bad this film isn't available on d v d the video print i saw was washed out and the sound reproduction wasn't that great br br highly recommended for action fans br br this film takes place before the of drugs br br in holland
<START> i'm not sure whether i like this film or not i think it is creepy and completely weird crispin glover as always gave a great performance as i think his performance was really good and one of his best but i don't like the character at all keanu reeves performance was really good and i truly felt for his character over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real i disliked some but genuinely felt sorry for others keanu reeves i would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didn't end how i expected it to i was disappointed in the ending and i don't feel that it did the rest of the film justice if you are into creepy weird and really well different movies go for this one if you like things that are normal please stay away
<START> the eighth and thus second to last short of the animatrix ones this is the only one quite like this this takes two of the main types of filmed entertainment inspirations of the matrix and combines them unbelievably well this is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect the tone the animation is a gorgeous breathtaking animÃ© the style which is omnipresent in this is noir the plot is fitting and the story telling as well as the music is spot on the sound in general is fantastic and really helps solidify the mood and atmosphere along with the drawings and designs the voice acting is impeccable this is one of only two where people also in the movies reprise their roles and both have anne moss who is the only of them appearing in this this is one of the best of the nine and also one of my personal favorites this is about ten minutes long the pacing is perfect it never slows down terribly much but it's not overwhelming either the ending could not have been more appropriate for this this shares a nine and a half minutes long making of with kid's story and it's well done and informative i recommend this warmly to any fan of the universe and the two genres that this is made up of 8 10
<START> this is an action packed film that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time i see it the film short of its conclusion demonstrates that in the face of extreme odds it is still possible to prevail br br this film is very refreshing and likely to be banned at any moment get a copy of it before the thought police burn every copy they can find they don't want you to have hope for the future or to think you have a chance br br on the other hand should political correctness fail to supress it this would be an excellent movie to release on dvd such a release could contain interviews with the writer and director and related goodies i'm sure it would sell some copies and i would be one of the first to buy it br br
<START> leonard can write lyrics but he sure can't sing nor has he had an original idea in his life just a floater from the looks of this nasty little puff piece note that his publishers and stewart were involved in the production he didn't know how to live either the woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical advertisement while irving layton was given a credit the other poet interviewed earle birney was to remain nameless i come from the generation just after cohen where all the boys seemed to idolize him his lack of commitment was probably just calling to them i hadn't realized what a disappointing he was back then i was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because of his age br br whiny little rich prince and not one memorable line in his oeuvre no dedication to social change outside of the sexual arena br br you don't speak for my generation lennie and not for my gender go back to the monastery and stay off the screen br br as for my local public broadcaster i will let them know what i think of them wasting my time on this guy not a has been a never was
<START> if you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film i would have told you it was great however i left the theatre feeling unsatisfied after thinking a little about it i believe the problem was the pace of the ending i feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow and then the ending developed very fast so i would say the ending left me disappointed br br i thought that the characters were well developed costner and kutcher both portrayed their roles very well yes ashton kutcher can act also the different relationships between the characters seemed very real furthermore i thought that the different plot lines were well developed overall it was a good movie and i would recommend seeing it br br in conclusion good characters great plot poorly written edited ending still go see it
<START> a lot of people say the end did not make sense but it did with the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off having picked up a lot of lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls enough to re energize those cells and create new bat creatures it seems they do not have carnal sex like vampires of legend br br vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous but killing them with with a shot to force center below the heart is consistent all you can ask for is consistency the viewer has to suspend disbelief even for scifi br br the only problem is having to be a sword or stake not bullets that puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci fi so that is a problem br br the only major inconsistency i found is killing the male vampires with the sword but the soul of the girl and go up to the ship i assume the males souls also went up the ship but not shown br br what about all the humans killed do their forces souls go up to the ship as discrete entities are does all the lifeforce get merged into one for use as ship sees fit in other words all the human souls that went to the ship could be re incarnated as bat creatures br br the basic concept is no more ridiculous than star wars force or even re incarnation br br this movie was over the top kitchen sink dawn of the dead meets alien meets dracula but in many ways profound it was also a beautiful love story the beginning and end were ethereal it both began what is happening to me and ended as a love story br br most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre so what bizarre is an art form as far as being ludicrous it all fits the plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the aliens just killing people maybe they didn't need patrick steward's blood to form an image of the girl but it was a very far out surreal scene br br another reason the movie is hated is because of the end but the end fits perfectly with the beginning people are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core its a lover story from start to finish it starts with and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way so it fits perfectly most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster and this movie did not end that way which is precisely why i love it br br instead it has a happy ending with the 2 of them going back to ship to be reborn way cooler than the hero kills monster end but that is exactly why it bombed it was not a straight up horror or even scifi horror at all but a love story with a beautiful beginning and end all those souls twinkling on the ship and the crystal room pulsating with new life br br most people can't deal with a love story that is also alien meets dawn of the dead meets dracula
<START> jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think he's a great actor eternal sunshine for example br br however this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny you will sit stony faced throughout this film as it has nothing else to recommend it br br even if you do like carrey's comedy i am not sure you will find this film amusing i went to see it on a saturday night at 10 30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh they giggled throughout the trailers which weren't particularly funny but when it came to the film stony silence i think it raised about five genuine laughs br br the problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be it can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but i'm guessing it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters br br the strong point of the film is the hold ups and there was plenty of potential here but these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped meanwhile you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates br br four separate groups walked out of this film while i was there and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house his girlfriend having just returned from a month long vacation i would have done the same and in my entire 25 years of movie going i have done that just once before
<START> spoiler alert my boyfriend some friends and i rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies we sort of knew what we were getting into but the lack of plot direction and special effects actually left us hoping for a great or passable fight scene between the two main characters the badly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo that ate people like scooping ice cream we sort of get this in the end but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints its one redeeming quality is that its laughably bad with many salient details pointed out by other readers i recommend this movie if your into cutting onions to make yourself cry
<START> this weird movie from texas is about fallon a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s although he looks like a 60s c w singer with greasy hair and sideburns whose ship wrecks on an island owned by count pronounced de with his captain the count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain meanwhile creepy former nurse cassandra tells fallon the secrets of the castle the countess has leprosy and went mad fallon is trapped but brings supplies the captain is killed by a racist caricature slave fallon is thrown in the dungeon with the leper who always thinks it's her wedding day the leper bride is horny bu cassandra kills her fallon and cassandra escape the castle but the count and his slave chase them with dogs kills the slave and fallon kills fallon and cassandra fall in love over the course of the next year but when the supply ship comes the crew refuses to take our lovers because they're both lepers now they live for years in the castle fallon's hair turns gray and cassandra goes bonkers fallon puts her in the dungeon our tale of love and leprosy ends br br so bizarre it's watchable and you can smell the drive in popcorn
<START> an interesting concept turned into carnage br br my first seeing feature from geoffrey wright romper when i first took interest in it it seemed at the time an interesting concept br br shakespere aussie film gothic setting melbourne gangland br br a very odd mixed that turned into a disastrous piece of aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name br br pros interesting concept br br cons waste of a good cast stuffed and stupid plot crooked camera angles not much variety of locations crap use of shakespearian diologue br br overall australia's worst attempt of a shakespere film stick to baz or romper warning that film is dangerous
