<START> fortunately i haven't seen this film in a movie big screen just on a small screen on video i doubt that i would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film after watching the first 30 minutes i became both disappointed and curious br br disappointed because of the hard to follow story line the hardly understandable screens the huge amount of aggression i still don't know why i had been shown the main character pulling out raw the teeth of another person his on women him cutting out his tongue and also curious to see what will the film say as a conclusion what is the ending summary of all this brutality br br unfortunately though the movie was not boring i didn't get any answer to all these cruelty that i had to watch from the beginning to the end to my opinion if you want blood and want to laugh there is kill bill 1 2 if you want blood with more meaning you can take any recent war movie and if you want an eastern movie there are much better titles out there afterwards i will take the ratings from the cannes film festival with more as while oldboy got a lot of praise from the jury it had not much to say to me and had only 4 10 on my scale br br i am hungry to see something beautiful harmonious with true feelings and a clear message
<START> mexican 'classic' was the third entry in the aztec mummy series as you will soon find out this movie is anything but a classic instead it's more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore you br br some scientist wants to steal aztec treasure from a tomb but guarding that tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial the aztec mummy knowing he can't beat the mummy he then builds a robot and a very bad one at that we only get to see mr robot in the last reel as he clunks around and does battle with the aztec mummy br br i have seen a lot of lousy sci fi films hell most sci fi films i see are lousy but this one for it's entire duration of 64 is the worst movie i've seen with fubar coming in a close second br br in conclusion don't waste your time
<START> recap since the warrior queen raised and slaughtered most of sonja's family she has trained in the art of sword fighting now has taken a very powerful talisman that threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed killing sonja's sister in the process now sonja is out for revenge and to save the world along the way she meets the very conan like but not conan no the child prince and his bodyguard falcon at first sonja declines all help but is later forced to accept it and together they go to save the world br br comments when you watch a movie like this and you think that it is the story that the is the best element in this movie the movie is in big trouble because 1 a movie like this should draw its strength upon good swordfights and effects and 2 the story is really really bad it is simple and uncomplicated and really offers nothing in way of character development or even suspense it is predictable and boring and the obvious couple sonja and has no chemistry at all and the kid is just annoying and most of the scenes is drawn out so long that they become boring though the movie is not very long it has not material enough to fill its time and so back to point 1 the fighting is slow uneventful and really bad it clearly shows most fighters clearly blocking the opponents strokes far ahead of the opponent has even begun to strike in my honest opinion i believe most kids fighting with sticks creates more exciting fights playing knights than this movie did all in all this is a really bad spin off that should be avoided by all who liked the conan movies br br 2 10
<START> i had the good fortune to be at island in the fall of 1959 the di showed one evening at the outdoor theater directly in front of our barracks b co 1st 1st br br although we hadn't been there long enough to even think about seeing a movie we could hear those that were laughing it's one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at pi br br at some later date i got to actually see it in a theater i'm still convinced that to date it remains the most realistic portrayal of the experience in the late 1950's ever done no one has done it better than jack webb
<START> he's the only reason to see this film he gives a very good performance much better than this crap deserves he's very handsome and very talented he deserves better than this also depressing is to see malcolm mcdowell in this he's another talented actor who deserves better but like esai he gives a very good performance so if you're fans of either of them you might want to watch otherwise stay away one more complaint couldn't we have had more scenes of esai shirtless
<START> on this site i've often lambasted the americans for not knowing how to write comedy but while they've never produced anything of the quality of towers' or 'the fall and rise of reginald they have also never to my knowledge made anything as bad as this the nadir of british comedy br br on my richter scale of comic awfulness it rates only behind the truly execrable 'are you being as the worst comedy show in the english language with bad acting annoying characters and humour that i'd grown out of before i left primary school unfortunately it was part of a large crop of shows back then along with 'dad's army' 'it ain't half hot mum' and 'allo that relied on ridiculous situations and familiar catch phrases to keep audiences amused br br michael crawford proved later on that he's a talented performer but personally i'd rather be sentenced to a month of watching than endure a single episode of this drivel which makes me ashamed to be british
<START> this film is completely underrated br br it's a film similar to will keenan and patrick waiting as well as adrien brody's restaurant and the classic film breaking away which are all about young adults who are stuck and know they're stuck with little or no chance of breaking free br br death by pizza delivered is about an intelligent free thinking artistic young adult will played by david who is stuck and waiting bitter at the world's hypocrisy and bitter at his own lack of direction and desire will meets his nemesis reed ron eldard another intelligent young adult who's so bitter he's chosen the path of crime both end up helping each other to free themselves of their bitterness which enables them to get unstuck br br for these young adults getting unstuck or breaking free can mean both forging ahead into life and plunging downward into death br br will's life is filled with the trademarks of a young stuck adult a soul sucking sweaty under paying job crude customers an ex girlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated a partial college education with no degree a house filled with self made art and of course the new friend whose ungodly choices help him to save himself
<START> danny boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the that honour belongs to lifeforce which is of course the greatest naked space vampire zombies from halley's comet running amok in london end of the world movie ever made tobe hooper may have made a lot of crap but for this deliriously demented epic sci fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals plus it offers space vampire mathilda may the best thing to come out of france since simone simon spending the entire movie naked which she does very very well just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered she's also totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous it's a pitch meeting i'd have loved to have sat in on astronauts from the british space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant 150 mile long umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of halley's comet filled with giant bats and bring them back to earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of london of their lifeforce amid much nudity of thunder and spit your coffee across the room i've been in space for six months and she looks perfect to me assume we know nothing which is understating the matter don't worry a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex oh and we'll get the writers of alien and blue thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of mark of the devil the sex thief and eskimo nell and the director of the jonestown monster sounds like a winner here's Â have fun and they do they do br br true there's enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thought provoking at a time when aids hysteria was approaching its height a sexually transmitted 'plague' offers ample opportunity for allegory but in the hands of the go go boys at cannon what could have been another quatermass and the pit quickly turns instead to be more plan 10 from outer space it's full to bursting with delirious inanity be it frank finlay's hilarious death scene here i go peter firth's grand entrance i'm colonel caine from the sas discreetly shouts michael across a room full of reporters gentlemen that last remark was not for publication this is a d notice situation he replies to the surprisingly obliging the security guards offering mathilda may's naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people the sweaty prime minister sucking the life out of his secretary and london filling up with zombie nuns stockbrokers and as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since mrs lost junior at funfair and went on the rampage and that's not mentioning the this woman is a masochist an extreme masochist scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire's it'll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me line while a lead stake wielding peter firth adopts his best action man voice to reply i'll do just that in one scene alone you have a possessed patrick stewart embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut hero's mind steve i never got over playing charlie manson railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full on mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him the inimitable aubrey morris the only man who makes freddie jones look restrained playing the home secretary sir percy as a kind of demented brian peter firth one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a doctor who around the time no one was watching it anymore hamming up the blasÃ© public school macho in the hope that no one will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of john hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door mid psychic tornado to bring in more drugs as if they needed any more in this film it's just a shame that frank finlay's mad haired scientist who isn't qualified to death on alien life forms a role originally intended for klaus kinski missed out on the action in that one br br no matter how mad you think the film is it still manages to get madder still whether it be a zombie pathologist he too needs feeding exploding all over the home secretary's suit patrick stewart's blood and entrails forming a naked mathilda may or the space vampires turning st paul's cathedral into the world's biggest laser show to transport human souls from the london underground to their mother ship i loved every gloriously insane moment in it's own truly unique way this might be the greatest film ever made br br the dvd offers the original 116 minute version that opened in the uk rather than the heavily edited 101 minute us version which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar but also fully restores henry mancini's score to its original glory the us version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by michael kamen and james guthrie although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic universal sci fi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from blake edwards sadly there's no more than a trailer by way of extras though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from hooper's originally intended 128 minute cut from what's on display here these might just offer even more comedy gold
<START> i only rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings it totally sucked i cannot imagine how anyone would think this a good movie even an ok movie none of the characters had any redeeming qualities of any kind to varying degrees they were each selfish and mean spirited or abused and damaged personalities who hadn't a clue about the spirit of christmas when this takes place i know canadians and like them but i cannot think that even they would think this a good movie i'd rather a sharp stick in the eye than watch this offensive movie again a colossal waste of time and money do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that it was worth watching this person probably would enjoy having a dentist drill their teeth without anesthesia too don't mean to be unkind but for the life of me i cannot imagine what this person was thinking unless they had ulterior motives maybe s he was the director or the producer if so i'd like to ask them to give me back my money if your money is important to you save it instead of renting this piece of drek or rent something anything else i'm running out of good reasons not to rent this film if i were canadian i'd be ashamed that it's supposed to be a favorite canadian flick if so i would say that those who think so are definitely in need of great quantities of powerful drugs
<START> ok i have seen gordon lewis movies before but this one really takes the cake its really gory and gross not to mention disgusting the way the strippers are done in i'm talking bad acting that makes plan 9 from outer space look like hamlet the only saving grace is the late great henny youngman as the strip club owner yeah take my wife please the are real sexy for 1972 i believe they used this same plot again in the roger corman movie stripped to kill in 1987 i did enjoy the earlier h g lewis flick 100 maniacs which was a mini masterpiece of sorts but bad acting no awards here but be aware this is a splatter movie that paved the way for friday the 13th and saw in one disturbing scene a half naked stripper has her butt spanked with a meat tenderizer ugh morbid stuff here h g lewis strikes again 2 out of 10
<START> black water co directed and written by david and andrew is very simple in its execution yet effective the film is a low budget australian movie that will unfortunately not get the recognition it deserves because as far as creature features go this is one of the best out there the setup is rather basic grace her husband adam and her younger sister lee are touring some in the northern territory when a saltwater crocodile flips their boat and leaves them stranded in the trees the whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is lurking below waiting to strike unlike greg rogue another killer croc movie released earlier in 2007 black water is not about the audience having fun guessing who's gonna be eaten next it is about hoping and praying that the three people will get out safely br br the three unknown actors do a great job with pretty demanding roles considering it was filmed on location with a real crocodile instead of cgi the characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced suspense is built up throughout the entire film we do not see a lot of the creature but just knowing it is near is terrifying enough this is edge of your seat stuff and highly recommended if you enjoy original and most importantly scary horror films br br 4 5
<START> from an artistic standpoint the movie fails to entertain or provide any moral resolution the plot is hard to follow if there is one at all the acting is tough to stomach the dialogue is cliche and clearly written by somebody who doesn't know english only the cinematography was worth watching in this movie although you can still see flaws in the picture br br as an asian american female the movie angered me because it proved how narrow minded people can be politically speaking putting asian women in such disgraceful roles should be outlawed perpetuating stereotypes of asian prostitutes is not only bad for the self esteem of asian women but also to the country as a whole i feel for the lead actress who played maya and the exploitation she must have faced in playing such a role br br as americans please avoid this movie art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for one another not hold it back
<START> an unusual revisionist western well worth watching despite a slow start the film builds Â with scarcely any dialogue and no subtitles Â an increasingly involving and intense almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the western desert the growth of the lead characters is worth waiting for and the strong central cast bring a real sense of desperation to the struggle for ownership of the all important horse how interesting that this was made by a british director i hope he's smiling now i get the impression the film was largely ignored by contemporaries but time works its usual alchemy and hidden gold shines out as it inevitably must one note jarred for me the revisionism is only carried so far sam waterston as an indian granted he plays his part with real emotion and intensity but really couldn't one american indian actor be found to do the job but his scenes with caroline langrishe have an intimacy which contrasts nicely with the immense landscape around them br br forget big bankrupt hollywood versions of the past men with big chins and swirling music this one is all about a primeval struggle between protagonists who stripped of all the trappings of 'ordinary' life come to understand what is worth fighting for impressive
<START> this is an extraordinary film musically it made me feel awful that rodrigues died in 1999 before i had a chance to see her live to know that she performed a marvelous lincoln concert in 1991 that i might've been there but wasn't is painful beyond words br br i just purchased my first recording while the musical recording is fantastic being able in this film to see her face its tremendous expressiveness passion as she sings these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful sort of like seeing the face of mary as she cradles jesus in her arms in the watching her on film reminded me of being witness to a similar extraordinary concert performance by mercedes sosa in the mid 1990s at lincoln as i sat listening to mercedes sing i felt i was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual musical force that contained awesome primal power some of the art of 's musical segments are touching such as caetano paying tribute to singing one of her songs solo in front of a packed concert hall the musical segments also convey the incredible international sweep of her musical repertoire the bonds she created w fans throughout the entire world there is one segment in which she claims that she has played in every single town in italy that has a stage br br in another section talks about her bout w mouth cancer how she came to nyc to commit suicide in a hotel yet through watching fred astaire film videos she gradually persuaded herself that life was worth living turned away from killing herself amazing later in the film she quite bravely directly admits to the interviewer that though she might've conquered the world musically her personal life was one of pure sadness she admits that she has never been happy this is unbearably sad to hear but perfectly in keeping w a singer steeped in the which she translates as bad destiny or bad luck tradition also one longs to hear more about her personal life what was in that made her so sad what were her disappointments br br the art of is a little disappointing in other major areas my quibbles to show 20 30 full songs in the film yet to only provide an english translation for the very last one seems a waste unless the film was only intended for a portuguese speaking audience which i can't imagine to see the profound pain on her face as she sings not to understand the lyrics is a let down as for the other minuses there is almost no biographical material about family background there is one 20 sec snippet w her singing w her mother it's absolutely grand there is one short reference to her parents moving fr the countryside to lisbon i would've loved to see film footage of the village she came from the interviews such as they are are almost solely w herself a few close friends she is a good but not great subject there are no interview subjects who are experts on or portuguese culture society so we get no depth of understanding of her musical roots br br in short this is a wonderful film that everyone interested in should see but it's not a perfect or definitive work on the subject
