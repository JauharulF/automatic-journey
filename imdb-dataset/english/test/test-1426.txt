<START> i had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing but i just found it annoying it's been a while since i've seen it and hopefully i won't find out all my memories are wrong and i'm unjustly condemning this movie but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray leopold and loeb as victimized by an anti gay society and that this somehow caused their horrible crime i totally disagree with this point of view and think it's unfair both to homosexuals and to bobby franks the real victim of the story i can't imagine why anyone would want to claim those two as martyrs i also thought l l were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they actually were after all they were teenagers who lived at home the film places them in a kind of fantasy world that seems like it should be scored by morrissey br br i just read an interview with one of the filmmakers that implied the film's anachronisms such as the push button phones that characters used were meant to add brechtian distance they certainly do that but i happened to find it highly irksome br br apparently a number of people found this movie interesting but i would have preferred a less stylish and more realistic examination of the part homosexuality may have played in the leopold loeb case
<START> very mildly spoilerish br br i must start by saying that i'm not usually impressed by science fiction so pitch black 2000 was a pleasant surprise it had me hooked from the very beginning with rhythm intensity and visual outburst that left me fascinated and glued to my seat i'm very happy to say that this movie was the best okay at least one of the best science fiction piece that i've seen in a long long time br br the plot in short might sound simple a space ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and the captain caroline fry impressive radha mitchell must lead the survivors to safety at first a cold blooded murderer riddick vin diesel who plays the role with very believable spare style might seem like the group's biggest problem but as the dusk starts crawling in the creatures of the night start awakening this leads to a desperate attempt to escape from the bloodthirsty predators which as we all can guess does not lead to a happy family picnic br br it's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth watching after all let's face it if you strip it down to the basics it's not that original but the skill in which it's told the story flowed forward didn't leave me yawning at least not much in any point the directing was fabulous work this was a very visual even beautiful movie the purple night view was a real treat although 'beautiful' might not be the right word to use yes the images shown were candy to the eye but they also added a touch of unspecified eeriness as if something was just about to burst out from under the still surface not to mention that the monsters were really well done they looked realistic which seems to be rare nowadays maybe people just can't be bothered to make them look real br br i did not only enjoy the visual side of the movie but also the psychological aspect of the story during the movie we get to see the characters unraveling some of them fall some of them rise but what fascinated me the most was the developing of the character of riddick i enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie to go even further the other thing i enjoyed a lot with riddick was the incredibly well and originally executed unresolved sexual tension between fry and him that didn't you'll get what i mean once you see it one can't deny that they had chemistry don't even try or i'll seek you out and make you listen to me playing chopsticks until you scream grin it was fresh as radha mitchell once put it a modified quote pitch black is a really sexy movie with no sex which is what makes it even more so interesting br br so to summarize i recommend this movie even if you're really not a fan of space stories the suspense was kept until the very end and what's important we were or at least i was left wanting for more if you can't be bothered to think about psychology subtext and such as is my bad habit you'll still find pitch black highly entertaining just kick off your shoes and enjoy
<START> i haven't seen hardware wars in years but i remember it as one of the most hilarious events of human experience and it was over far too soon every aspect of this movie was hilarious and it was even better than star wars i laughed i cried after watching it i asked a family member for a moment with three dollars just so i could kiss it goodbye i'm kidding about the last one i love it when ham sidekick co pilot tries to eat princess anne cinnamon hair buns and the nader character is just hilarious this film would be great to watch back to back with thumb wars and i sincerely wish there could have been a hardware wars episode ii the umpire strikes out was there
<START> this is by far the most vapid idiotic insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air and this is coming from someone who remembers san pedro beach bums br br my wife loves watching reality shows and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a walk the end result was straight out of monty python's ministry of silly walks sketch i couldn't laugh hard enough br br and then there's the ubiquitous ms banks as in laughing all the way to the she has to be the most annoying self important woman on tv since rosie o'donnell left the view as if modeling was doing great things for mankind please i've never found her attractive and i don't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth br br someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women
<START> the beautiful charming supremely versatile and talented irene dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses of american cinema in over 21 as in all her films she lights up the screen with a natural yet glamorous presence she is simultaneously authentic and human and a charismatic inspirational model this role is quintessential irene dunne full of pathos and wit and a little mischief i love all of her films and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when tcm aired it last night i hope they don't wait years to air it again br br likewise charles coburn is one of the greatest character actors in all of american filmdom true he often portrays variations on the same theme but i never tire of watching his soft hearted here his character is the perfect foil for irene dunne and he is portrayed perfectly by coburn their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic they never miss a beat in addition they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of irene dunne's husband portrayed by alexander knox br br i am not as familiar with work he was recognizable but that was about all however cast with dunne and coburn he holds his own he delivers a fine nuanced performance his character has noble motives that are made accessible to us by performance and never held over us like some holy grail he is noble but conflicted and doubts his ability to successfully complete his interaction with dunne is always convincing too dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr and he responds in kind their scenes are very well done br br the film itself is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and a milieu not portrayed in other movies i don't recall off the top of my head another movie that portrays america still fighting wwii but with the end in sight and the focus on the establishment of the post war world not the usual wwii movie that in itself is interesting it is also essential to the plot and the movie's message in contrast to other commentators i thought that the climactic speech was okay but not great it was delivered very well by knox but it was not as tightly written as the build up led me to expect i have heard better cinematic speeches addressing very similar themes it served its purpose br br for me the greater value of the movie was the depiction of the life of dunne and knox as it reflected the typical experience the sense of community among the wives living on terrace seemed absolutely authentic as did terrace itself despite the fact that it was obviously a sound stage set the incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their husbands the rigors of the candidates mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn the shabby base housing obviously hastily constructed the tired and worn furnishings the constant and harrowingly short deadlines for returning to base for learning lessons for catching trains to subsequent posts tenants constantly running into their predecessors and successors in the base housing as they were moving in and out yes i suspect this was a glimpse of a real wwii experience clothed in some comedy but very real at its core i loved it and i recommend it highly
<START> having read the book prior to watching this adaptation you would think that it would have lost some of its thrill however the story is so clever i could never tire of it br br sally and elaine really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters i fell in love with the story and the women all over again br br beautiful to watch thanks to direction settings and despite the plot speed of television i don't feel that anything important was lost in transit it had me on the edge of my seat throughout with lots of wonderful stomach trembling moments enjoyed it thoroughly this is the kind of television i have been waiting for
<START> it is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of kieslowski's trilogy it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite view them in order blue white and red and consider them together as one complete work it is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes liberty equality fraternity and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry they are each well worth seeing independently but i believe they are best seen as one work collectively i would rate the trilogy as a 9 separately i place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994 br br the color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad the profiled model of which is the central of the movie's three main characters the other two characters do a double take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad posted larger than life alongside a busy city intersection this ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons i have called red a mind film this is the third of kieslowski's three colors trilogy based on the blue white red of the french flag and the three parts of its motto liberty equality fraternity ' the films stay primarily focused on these themes keeping with the basic levels of one two or three main characters yet with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal liberty blue to equality white to social fraternity red red is my favorite of these films and i give it a 9 it stands by itself as a great film but one should see blue and white first for the fullest effect
<START> is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged james robert kennedy nicknamed and the football coach from the t l hanna high school harold jones br br cuba gooding jr is excellent as radio i would never imagine to see him in a serious performance specially because most of the movies i watch with him are comedies ed harris is great as harold jones but this actor is great so this is not anything new br br the mentally challenged young man called james robert kennedy always walk around the t l hanna high school without bothering anyone and almost not noticed one day when the ball is throw near him he decides to stay with the ball for the impatience of johnny cash one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met one day cash decides to punish james mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up br br when coach jones discovers that horrible act he stays angry and punish all the team deciding for this day on to help james who gets the nickname because of his passion for radios in general br br the movie shows how radio becomes an adept assistant helping the team train despite hardships from the players and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city br br i would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story it has a life lesson specially showing us how a person can make a difference even not being what we call radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone and that's a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives
<START> this film is well cast often silly and always funny lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection brent spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director from the first hare krishna to the last you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs i thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy
<START> prime suspect 4 continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice detective superintendent jane the first of three miniseries with the notable absence of founding writer lynda la plante from the credits imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series the second three series pit against the forces of evil while coping with middle age loneliness indiscretions a host of personal and professional problems and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal conjures two stories while are single episodes each which find seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good in other words to prevail must overcome both evil and good forces something which makes the always gray scenarios of the ps series yet and the wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers very good stuff which only gets better from series to series b
<START> shirley temple's films for twentieth century fox aren't negligible because they're poorly made darryl f zanuck supervised most of them after all they don't retain much of a classic stature among cinema aficionados mainly because they're weighed down with the syrupy optimism of depression era hollywood 1930s audiences were by the delight of seeing a often orphaned sunshine girl making the grown ups look foolish by comparison they fretted and wrung their hands while she danced her troubles away seen these many years later temple's vehicles barely get by on story aided always by musical sequences to bolster the content and her timing always too perfect and exaggerated reactions might leave most modern viewers rolling their eyes no one could possibly be blamed for their exasperation over temple's performance here shouting lines at the top of her lungs or the perverseness of her dance steps with a crowd of sailors to at the codfish ball still the fantasy aspect of this particular story previously filmed in 1924 from the book by laura e richard is enough to captivate those in the proper saccharine spirit seems shirl was pulled from a shipwreck by a government appointed lighthouse keeper but when a truant officer from the state board finds out the tyke isn't in school she threatens to take the kid away it doesn't really matter if the prune faced officer has a point that temple isn't being raised properly the woman is turned into the proverbial villainess almost immediately one can see right away that temple can hold her own taking care of herself and her elderly guardian in the bargain as well as the local widow who has her hooks in for the captain temple isn't the only one overly rehearsed guy kibbee's january is cued for wide eyed reactions so often you wonder if maybe if he didn't film them all in one day the dialogue is steeped in waterfront metaphors you can't rush a trout well don't give up the ship and something about the whole enterprise seems strangely pixilated from
<START> thank you mario van peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow br br the plot backdrop music and talent were all top notch it was great that you used so many african american artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy it was also good to see billy zane in this movie does he ever play a good guy br br i would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking this is an excellent movie and i feel privileged to have seen it hopefully you'll feel the same
<START> while this isn't one of miss davies' very worst films it is pretty bad and it's sad that in a revisionist fashion recent imdb raters have deliberately over inflated the scores on some of her films to make up for her being slighted in the past or so it seems for years conventional wisdom has been that davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles she got because her beau william randolph hearst bought her way into hollywood this certainly is the image created in orson welles' citizen kane it is true that hearst did use his considerable wealth and clout to build davies' career with all this money it's not surprising that she made some excellent films and it isn't surprising that people got snippy due to all the extra attention she got sleeping with the man who finances your films is bound to get noticed however despite this edge she also made a decent number of bad films and i think we really need balance when it comes to the scores of her movies after all no rational person could believe that as of today 1 5 08 peg o' my heart and two other davies films recently shown on turner classic movies the girl and marianne deserved the exceptionally high scores ranking them higher than such films as high noon ben hur the best years of our lives and all quiet on the western front in fact marianne would now rank as the fifth best movie ever according to imdb with a score of 8 8 considering most people out there don't even know who marion davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters this is a serious problem however she was a much better actress than citizen kane implied and initially broke into films before she began sleeping with hearst br br what sets peg o' my heart apart from these two other movies is that marianne and the girl were pleasant little films while peg o' my heart is in some ways just terrible much of the reason was the terrible miscasting of marion while her french accent in marianne was cute in peg her irish accent just sounded bizarre not particularly irish plus and perhaps i'm mistaken but her continual use of the word 'ye' makes her sound like she should be doing shakespeare not a film set in 1933 ireland also there was a bizarre insistence that marion should be the consummate multi talented star so they had her not just act but dance and sing the singing actually fit the scripts in some of her films but here it seemed out of place and seriously detracted from the film it just seemed like you could almost hear hearst shouting out see she is a great actress look at her sing and dance sadly marion just looked uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes but for me the biggest problem was the idea of having 36 year old marion playing such a youthful role it was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be like the ones mary pickford played in the teens and twenties complete with the pig tails and plucky attitude miss pickford could carry off these roles even though she too wasn't a girl any more but here marion had put on a bit of weight and looked at least 30 no offense she looked fine for her age but she did not look like a teen br br oddly with the millions that hearts spent on marion's career he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script and one that fit marion's talents believe me i have rated several of her films very high i especially adore show people but here she just couldn't help but flop this film was a turkey
