<START> i couldnt believe how well this kid did on screen you will completely forget that they are actors and loose yourself in the movie it is like watching home movies with a twist i recomend this to everyone highly
<START> throughout watching end of days i got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average hollywood action film they failed of course but you have to give them credit for trying peter actually tried directing this time instead of just churning out another flat action film he attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood this method can work if used correctly see se7en but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us is a decent action director and offers nothing more here than basic shoot outs and fight scenes except for the lackluster sub par f x end battle as a photographer demonstrates actual ability displaying some good frame work and movement but it is nothing above solid work br br screenwriter andrew marlowe is the film's greatest enemy at parts the script actually shows the makings of good religious thriller and at times it even shows some quasi intellectual thought the temptation scene between arnold and gabriel byrne but these small pluses are choked out by a river of negatives generic dialogue characters plot holes and convenient plot points that just happen to point all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard hollywood black holes screenplay falls into the shadow of the good movie it could have been faded very quickly br br the film surprisingly has a good cast arnold still possessing that larger than life attitude tries to play a depressed on the edge cop with no more than average results stick to be the invincible hero arnie it's what your good at gabriel byrne is the strong point of the ensemble bringing a nice air of cynicism to the role of satan in a villainous role ripe for overacting byrne restrains himself and it adds a bit more menace to the character kevin pollak as normal is able to bring at least a few chuckles to the movie but he's done better also look for a stellar small role from rod steiger br br looked like he was trying to separate this from the faceless mass of hollywood action films he was heading in the right direction but had neither the script or originality to take it there br br 4 10
<START> i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on it brings back happy times for me i grow up in a big city in the mid west it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost the big mama's of day are under the age of 55 will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past the music was great in this movie i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about he did an superb job in writing and producing this film i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you as soon as i can i will be obtaining a copy for my home use i alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than thanks for such a great movie
<START> i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine i'll admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy i was wrong kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions this one did exactly that the entire theater which was sold out was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying this movie was great and i suggest that you go see it before you judge
<START> this type of show is not supposed to happen on television this is the type of edginess usually reserved for independent film this is what only hbo is supposed to do fact is that denis leary has managed to come up with one of the best television shows ever easily joining the ranks of the sopranos oz ed etc kudos the gang at abc for showing that nypd blue was not a fluke and to mr leary and his gang for creating a truly unique viewing experience my only complaint is that the show is not long enough an hour would make it better but i can't wait for the next episode
<START> one of low budget horror schlockmeister actor john carradine's more animated roles as a implied nazi scientist who is turning humans into zombies to serve the reich mindless scuffling brain dead only able to obey the most simple of orders bit like staff in mcdonalds br br hitler isn't mentioned by name since america wasn't at war at the time they was filmed but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for br br there seems to be two types of zombies in film the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black white films of the 1930's and '40's blank eyed and just following the commands of someone else as they stumble along and then there is the type we know from later films like 'the night of the living dead' and 'the evil dead ' still roaming about but with only the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims both have their moments in various movies over the years br br features the former zombie type although these are particularly goofy looking and would look more at home in an old time freak shows as geeks as they bite the heads off chickens one black zombie named lazarus with his wild hair looks like a young don king br br as to the plot the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and that's where he makes his mistake even though he lets her keep her heels as a nice womanly touch as he turns her into one of the living dead she's not happy about it br br it all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears and the moral of the tale must be never ever turn your wife into a zombie it's just asking for trouble br br the film is interesting enough and it quickly rolls along to a finish but never rises above it's poverty row origins not a patch on any true zombie classics but fun just the same
<START> after the suicide of his father charlie 'kid' davis ray boom mancini accepts the invitation and advice of his friend tiny michael chiklis and travels to las vegas with him trying to become a boxer on the road they meet gina jennifer beals hitchhiking they give a lift to her and she becomes charlie's girlfriend johnny ticotin rod steiger is convinced by tiny to be charlie's couch and the powerful agent alex dumas joe mantegna after watching him fighting becomes his manager promoting charlie's career this movie is so boring that it indeed does not deserve to spend much time writing about it i do not like boxing but sometimes i watch some worthwhile movie about this theme but this one is horrible predictable full of clichÃ©s having an awful lead actor a pure waste of time my vote is three br br title brazil e alma' body and soul'
<START> boston blackie movies have some strengths mostly in that the pacing is swift and the hero is cheerfully unfazed in even the worst circumstances but the plotting is frequently atrocious and the unrelenting comic bits often kill the pacing if the plot happens to be atypically good or are just unfunny and inappropriate br br this one involves blackie chasing an escapee from the asylum steve cochran in a really poor performance who has become fixated on beautiful nina foch who puts in a nice rather subtle acting job inspector of course believes blackie has gone homicidal maniac he at least has some evidence in this one for that and is incompetently trying to jail him as blackie goes after the real killer the plot has possibilities but any time any real tension gets going we a get a not funny comedy routine it doesn't seem like anyone at columbia understood that in a movie about a pursuit of a really dangerous maniac cute little comedy scenes about hiding an inconvenient body from the inspector disrupt any willing suspension of disbelief one just concludes our clever hero is an idiot deadly for a film like this br br this one is not worth the time for a well plotted episode of this series see alias boston blackie
<START> when i saw that this film was being aired on late night tv i initially decided to give it a miss i am glad that i then started watching yes the special effects are the same as gerry andersen's puppet shows some of the actors actresses are from his other productions he obviously used the same composer later on as the cheesy soundtrack could only have come from one of his productions and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend get by all that and you have a film that shows up intriguing possibilities is there a planet on the far side of the sun is it a duplicate earth is everything about it reversed and if so do they speak english in reverse i love this dated sf if only for gerry's wonderful model cars planes buildings and spaceships some of them are not so far fetched as they seemed back then and did you see the european space centre logo very reminiscent of the euro logo of today suspend belief and spend a couple of hours watching this you will be glad you did
<START> house of dracula was made towards the end of universal's horror cycle of the 1940's and i've seen this a couple of times br br a mad doctor edelman is breeding plants for a serum that cures people count dracula arrives for a cure for his vampirism and lawrence talbot then comes to see if he can cure him from turning into a werewolf at full moon frankenstein's monster is then discovered and edelman brings him back to life just as the villagers descend on the castle and set it on fire talbot now cured and one of edelman's female assistants are safe though br br like a lot of movies of its kind we have a hunchback assistant and thunderstorm to keep it moving br br the cast includes universal horror regulars lon chaney jr the wolf man john carradine house of frankenstein and glenn strange as frankenstein's monster also starring onslow stevens them lionel atwill the vampire bat and martha br br house of dracula is a must see for all old horror fans out there great fun br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> from what i remember seeing of this film it was not good i always say that if a film is good and can keep you attention throughout the hardest of moments example a tylenol cold sinus war than it is a film that has done its job the fact that i was asleep for most of this film only proves the fact that it could not keep my attention and ergo it did not complete its job why did i fall victim to the tylenol cold sinus when i had a film in my arsenal br br to begin committed did not make any sense the acting was poor and the overall story left more doors opened that just couldn't be closed i am thinking of the moment when i swear i saw affleck and graham brother and sister in this film kissing that didn't make any sense then there was a scene with affleck and his roommates indicating that he was sleeping with one of them almost breaking up a perfect lesbian couple i suppose this was to show that most are not as committed to a relationship as graham is but for me it just was nothing more than filler i have this suspicious feeling that the director of this film was sleeping with affleck his acting in this film was atrocious i mean i have never seen him do any good acting but this was by far the worst oh i just had another moment during the battle come through my mind and i confirmed it with imdb com what was john stewart doing in this film that was yet again another moment when my eyes were opened just for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever br br and frankly it's heather graham we could care less about her after a while she's just not interesting she's just bland boring and basically stops acting after a while while they desperately start throwing wacky characters into the mix to revive the movie it just doesn't work and instead of just calling it a day they start throwing more characters into the mix so now it's just weird tedious boring and really really long luke wilson's slow drawl acting style slows an already crawling movie to dead halt why exactly were these two married committed is a truly terrible film the kind of hip comedy that leaves you staggering out depressed and bored br br grade out of
<START> the story of an obsessed lover shahrukh khan and the lengths he goes to get his true love juhi chawla who's already married to her husband sunny deol the film is considered one of shahrukh khan's best performances and won him acclaim from critics and audiences alike fear that your love may not be reciprocated fear that you may lose the one you love fear that your beloved could have a change of heart in short fear is the villain in every love story br br but in fear is the ultimate expression of passion of obsession and of sacrifice is shahrukh khan story whose love and obsession for kiran juhi chawla frees him from all fears of life death is sunny deol story whose enduring love and passion for kiran gives him the courage to face the fear of death br br and finally is story who is caught between one man's love and another man's obsession she fears one fears for the other one stands for love the other for life in this battle between love life the supreme victor is love because love always wins in life death simply darr is one of the best indian films ever made
<START> to judge a movie just for the landscapes decor costumes it is just not right you are missing the core the story br br a movie has to narrate something to tell a story something that impress you yes i was pleased by the sea cliffs clear water and all that but there is the plot br br they are more interesting movies with mad people such as flight over the cuckoo s nest etc etc this one is about a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than his children or his husband just a clear psychiatric case nothing extraordinary unfortunately a waste of time and there is all that rage coming from fish smell sea
<START> this often maligned movie is a must for fans of blake edwards julie andrews henry mancini or hollywood musicals other writers have commented on the shifts in tone the confusion of plot etc but the film has many things to recommend it the score is one of henry mancini's best and he has written many wonderful ones several songs are sung to perfection by andrews julie's performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes she is at her absolutely loveliest here the on location shots are breath taking and there are some funny inspector clouseau type sight gags to boot rock hudson basically phoned in his performance but he is passably good a real curiosity item in that it was the last major film julie did for about 10 years and in many ways is a precursor to victor victoria it is lovely to look at and listen to when will it be available on dvd when it is i for one would like both versions the longer and shorter director's cut since it was lampooned in s o b they would make a great two pack
<START> i watched this film on telly the other night and little did i know what a cringe fest it would be i knew it would be stupid but not this bad this film exemplifies everything that is awful in australian comedy apart from the most tedious uninspired scenarios and characters i have ever come across aside from those dubious french produced american tax break comedies most of the situations were boring unbelievable stereotypical and so not funny just terrible br br one such scenario that really annoyed me was the nerds on the bus scene from a screen writing perspective the writers used the most uninteresting not to mention unbelievable scenario to get these three stranded without their luggage they are on the holiday of their lives and they're going to risk it all including a 300 deposit luggage and room to exert their rights to dance on a bus i mean they're about half an hour away from their destination at least they could have had the bus driver kick them off but no they leave willingly cos 'they can't take it anymore 'and wreck their holiday anyway i can't believe the writers didn't workshop this appalling scenario out i think a ten year old could come up with 5 set ups more clever funny and believable br br i can go on with many others the really unimaginative stereotypical psychopath the whole relationship with the angry jilted girlfriend and tag along virgin the 'wow man out there goth girl' inhaling stuff on the train everything was just woeful i cannot think of one redeeming feature of the this film except that maybe the third wheel nerd was kind of cute spoilt his career by appearing in this trash though
