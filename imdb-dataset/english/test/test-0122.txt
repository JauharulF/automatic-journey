<START> positively ridiculous film br br if doris roberts shirley jones and shirley knight persist in these kinds of films they can submit their retirement papers and collect social security full time br br while the idea that a 35 year old swinger who works on video games loses his apartment and his forced to move in with grandma roberts and borders jones and knight this is foolishly dealt with imagine the 3 bags getting high on stuff that grandson alex has left in their home and jones going to bed with someone who may qualify as her grandson br br the video game sequences are as foolish as the rest of the film the assortment of characters that alex works with is beyond belief as he enjoys his weed habit along with the others br br terrible best describes this miserable film
<START> as a christian i found this movie to be completely embarrassing the actors sucked the writing sucked the cinematography sucked and the story was so typical i couldn't say this is a great witnessing tool because i'd be too embarrassed to show any of my unsaved friends hollywood has much better stuff and that's because they invest the best into it christians put out sh tty work and think it's ok because it's for the lord in the old testament people spent huge amounts of money to bring offerings to god david or saul i don't remember spent what would be equal to about 50 billion in todays money on building a temple for god but these days spending what would appear to be about 30 000 tops on making a movie to witness to people with is just pathetic it's the person not the product that affects someone don't waste your time trying to convert your friends with this waste of an hour and a half if you want to make a positive impact with people show them movies like the matrix american beauty braveheart etc movies that have something to say and actually get it into you
<START> interesting premise interestingly worked out the strongest feature of this film is the emotional tension of the astronaut who knows a truth but is unable to convey it to others overlook the weaknesses and just enjoy the movie but be prepared for a certain level of suspense
<START> where this movie is faithful to burroughs' vision it is excellent where it departs from burroughs it is superb it is a tale of family of the seeking of a father by a real and emotional orphan lambert's speaking of one of the most anguished lines in all of cinema he was my father is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic not a perfect motion picture the notorious over dubbing of mcdowell's voice by glenn close is unconscionable and only in terms of a very british error but a fine if flawed masterpiece and a noble farewell to sir ralph richardson
<START> is simply the best film i've ever seen it's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place some scenes are not nice or beautiful but the camera never peeks or intrudes this is exactly what's happening here the camera is used to intrude to disgrace and to ridicule there is no magic flow here no sense of greatness or respect instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan the music is disturbing just as i rated the best film ever made this one is the worst it's a pure movie too but this is the negative form exactly that which should not be done
<START> ok i saw this film through mystery science theater 3000 but i did see the movie so i figured i would leave a comment on it i just love once again how joe gets stuck with the crummy roles while his brother and nephew's are just getting the oscar winning roles left and right is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good it seemed like the director and actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects a story that didn't make much sense and not to mention pretty crummy acting abilities this is one of my favorite mst3k episodes simple because a lot of what they mention is what we are thinking throughout the film and i'll explain why in a moment br br natalie and zach are a couple who broke up and are now trying to work things over but since zach is in upper lower class and natalie is in middle class it just ain't gonna work but on the way home they and zach's friends get into a car accident and now the angel of death is after them to meet his quota of but also it seems like he's had some kind of other life relationship with natalie and just can't seem to move on so now natalie and zach must race against the ever appearing five million times a minute clock to save their souls and lives br br well i guess zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a stairway to heaven i wonder if black was wrong too lol basically there are a lot of plot holes in this movies like no one can see the characters and they can't be killed yet somehow they can still press buttons and open doors the angel of death had a very strange face and was a bit distracting from the story itself was just a lousy film that was rushed and makes you just feel so bad for joe the under appreciated sheen brother br br 2 10
<START> these critics need to find a new job this movie is based on a true story which has made history it illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all the breathtaking of greece has captured my heart and soul as if i too were there the blue eyed cage the delightful cruz were amazing together they perfectly portrayed how a mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war this movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it
<START> everyone is a genius in something albert einstien was a genius in science william shakespeare was a genius in literature and the boys from the chasers war on everything are truly comedy geniuses their satire tv show is a constant hit on the australian broadcast commission abc after a small start as a satire newspaper the chasers popularity when given their own television show never short on controversy with the cast members will do everything some of it even being arrested for chris taylor going on sunrise a very popular live morning television show and telling his partner to f k off creating a fake and driving into high security area and doing a very funny satire of a australian ad about nicotine by following smokers around yelling out no gary no no gary no while controversial the show is funny and worthy of running for years to come
<START> if there's one word i can associate to this movie its it must be embarrassing to everyone associated with the movie to actually watch it in a theatre everything the script screenplay dialogues song lyrics direction shoddy lousy br br saw this movie when i was a kid liked it then mainly because it was a fantasy a superhero movie its a not so explored genre in hindi cinema the attempt deserves credit but that's all there is to it sashi kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry in making the movie can't understand the reason behind casting foreigners as hindi speaking characters who can't even get the sync right nothing to say about the dubbing the screenplay is terrible the editing even more if one follows the dialogues closely one can detect grammatically wrong sentences which completely alter the intended meaning nothing special about the music br br the biggest embarrassment must be for the censor board there are a couple of nip slip scenes in the movie one of which is absolutely clear so much so that i can't even think of a metaphor the director missed them the editing team missed it and the censor board missed it too so much for the no indecent exposure on screen motto the officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie br br can't think of why amitabh went with the role it might be because he was a good friend of the kapoors but the role hardly has anything for him with wonderful roles in hum and behind him he couldn't have followed it up with a worse one there are a couple of heroic scenes really worthy ones but otherwise they're embarrassingly unbelievable arrow catching for instance it probably could've been better with cgi but it was '91 br br dimple and sonam do not exactly set the screen on fire kapoor and rishi kapoor give an inspired performance but their scope is limited amrish puri is his usual self in the role of a fairy tale villain letting out the villainous laugh every now and then br br on the whole an interesting concept could have been a lot more better
<START> i've always been fascinated by who would know that it will go further than beyond in ninja iii it's fun creepy and intriguing a ninja gets shot up by the police and uses his spirit for revenge the victim a lovely young woman named christie lucinda dickey she falls for the cop who was involved in the shooting the love scene where she pours the on her body knocked me out the death gets the attention of another in japan named yamada sho kosugi he comes to america not only to save christie but to put the ninja back to the grave simply because he put out yamada's left eye with a throwing star the fight scenes were excellent i liked the part when the plywood falls on yamada and he splits it with his foot and when he was caught he tells the officer christie was involved with that everything will be fine rule of thumb never under estimate a ninja he took out the other cops without killing them and he did his thing without worry of course did her best trying to put the ninja in his place for using her a tool for revenge it was a good movie great for martial arts buffs 3 out of 5 stars
<START> chop shop written and directed by ramin man push cart specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day without anyone ever really noticing they are there in new york br br these are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society they exist in a sort of grey world many of them migrants whose legal status in america is appears somewhat doubtful where do they come from how did they get there how do they cope where will they end up these are not feel good stories as such but stories about survival at its most basic day to day level br br ale is one such street kid he has no education and hustles anyway he can to save money he is also not beyond turning to petty theft mostly he is anxious to be reunited with his older sister we see him in the early scenes ringing a safe house looking for her but not having any real success a young friend carlos gets him a job in a chop shop in the shadows of shea baseball stadium eventually his older sister comes to live on site with him but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she makes extra money he dreams of buying a food van and setting up a vending business with his older sister br br shoots all his films on location there is nothing glossy or glossed over about them this is life as these people have to live it in the raw lt is not pretty although it is never ominous and the slightly despairing air that hangs over much of the film is the same one that hangs over these peoples' everyday lives br br the script is also very natural and the characters are given plenty of scope and room to work in is outstanding in the lead role and gonzalez gives solid support as the older sister
<START> this movie has one of the worst lead characters ever i say this because he is made out to be the hero when in my opinion everything he does in the whole movie screws up people's lives and causes problems he can do nothing right yet the movie makes him seem like the cool dude everyone should be looking up to he has temper tantrums at all the wrong times he has all the wrong stances on things that end up making people mad at him and getting people killed he is too nosy too pushy too macho too assuming makes all the wrong decisions and has no common sense br br it's about a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and son that he walked out on years ago the detective finds the woman and what he thinks to be her son however all kinds of things happen to make this story full of crime drama and twists it's made for tv what do you expect br br anyhow the movie is fairly entertaining johnny depp is very young in this one and has an awful 80's haircut he chews gum and tosses a soccer ball around for about 5 minutes and that is all we get to see of him br br for some reason the out of print vhs version of this sells for 40 in online it must be for johnny depp collectors only it couldn't be because of the plot it couldn't be br br
<START> this movie lacks in everything except bobby deol who in his own standards is mediocre no one in this movie has come close to act in a single scene is complete fake in her acting br br the great anupam kher has a guest appearance and is better in those 2 minutes than bobby in the whole movie the music does'nt compliment the movie br br that well the contrast in music between bobby and is not highlighted that well great concept gone completely wrong the movie does'nt have a proper ending please don't waste your time as i did on this movie
<START> great just great the west coast got dirty harry callahan the east coast got sharky burt reynolds plays sharky in sharky's machine and i enjoyed every minute of it playing a maverick narcotics cop in atlanta ga is just what everyone wants instead of suspension he's sent to vice squad like in the dirty harry movies or any other cop movies the captain is always going to be the jerk when i was a kid i was curious what that movie meant sharky's machine well i knew who played sharky i wonder what his machine was it was his group of fellow cops after uncovering the murder he goes all out to find the perp when it turns out to be a big time mob boss sharky doesn't play around when he gets the other prostitute into safety sharky fights back hard and good despite losing a finger to the thug and i also like the part where the bad gets blown out of the building through a plate glass window that was the bomb randy crawford's street life really put the movie in the right mood and the movie itself is really a great hit to me always rating 4 out of 5 stars
<START> between sweeping extraordinary scenes within a plethora of indian locations and a plot which is bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality this highly moving film is a must see for those who love a good romance adventure and by this i mean good not a hollywood or bollywood easy and contrived happy ending east meets west in a different take on the buddy film the performances are inspired and brilliant the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings hari om is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth see it
