<START> ordinarily anthony mann made westerns with 'the big guys' james stewart gary cooper henry fonda the a list cowboy stars but in this b film he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western the main character played by victor mature is a trapper mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films robert redford in johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men not here for once a true mountain man vulgar crude animalistic is the central figure and it's something to see giving mature one of his better later roles the real acting chops are provided by robert preston excellent as a self absorbed custer type cavalry commander and james whitmore the poor man's spencer tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officer's wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of mature's grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that she's attracted to him rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format good show and underrated movie all around
<START> my buddies and i spent the majority of a saturday afternoon watching a selection of bad movies among the flicks we watched the strongest contender for quality bad movie fare was easily jack o it's ludicrous that movies such as gigli glitter and you got served are listed in imdbs bottom 100 while they're certainly bad movies they don't belong in the bottom 100 they're robbing jack o and keeper of time etc of the bad movie greatness they so richly deserve br br so what makes jack o so great in bad movie terms for starters steve the director decided to cast his son ryan in the role of sean kelly unfortunately for steve ryan was dangerously close to being out acted by a block of wood the kid seriously has no ability to emote whatsoever the end result unintentional comic gold the kid could be listening to a joke or just moments away from getting his head smashed asunder and his expression is one of stony br br the other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of double dreaming sequences what is a double dream well it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare and then something equally nightmarish happens and then the character wakes up again basically they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare clever device no i believe the character of sean kelly experienced no less than 3 double dreaming sequences br br let's see what else oh yeah this movie has a veritable cast of thousands it's truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie best of all almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story they're either killed by jack o or they serve no purpose whatsoever br br jack o himself was pretty sweet like most other b movie monsters jack o has the amazing ability to seemingly teleport over great distances he's invariably hanging out somewhere in the background whenever you're dealing with a major character what's puzzling however is that when he's actually chasing someone he moves at a shambling stumbling speed and yet he's able to keep up with people who are sprinting br br that's all for now closing remarks if you're looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie you can't go wrong by renting this beast br br bad movie score 7 10 good movie score 3 5 10
<START> i am not quite sure what to say think about this movie it is definitely not the worst in the series there's still halloween 3 the style is just very different and it focuses on other elements than its predecessor did it tries to explain why michael myers freaks out on halloween and starts butchering around well all that stuff about michael myers being cursed and the evil cult was a rather nice effort but i didn't buy it none of the other installments in the series tried to come up with any fancy explanations br br the movie contains lots of gore actually it's plain carnage if you haven't seen the other halloween films you will probably like this one for its blood content but for a real halloween freak this sequel might be just too different to be seen as a good one suspense was turned into terror and carnage exploding heads you get the point br br the ending theatrical cut is simply awful michael gets stabbed with a needle then beaten up with a pipe then stabbed again this time with more needles then beaten up a little more until there's slime running out of his head where did this green stuff come from anyway basically it's nothing more than trash worth 5 million br br there was one good thing though michael's mask br br dedicated to donald pleasance quite a disgrace br br my rating 4 10
<START> although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast ice cream i scream is more like a caricature of sincerity br br the plot opens with the dream of ali a traveling ice cream salesman in a western town in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice cream companies he dreams of playing in his tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis dancing around him as his dream turns into a nightmare he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason is it because he is not successful in his job apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies but this is what he says we actually don't see him suffer that much he still sells good traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop selling ice cream to the people in the town ali blames big companies for using and coloring agents while he is using real powdered roots of mountain orchids ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business they always quarrel and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy br br in a very successful day his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town in search of his stolen bike ali goes to the police blames the big companies for the theft but of course nobody takes him seriously annoyed by the nagging of his wife ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk one of his friends at his table a wannabe socialist of the town gives a didactic speech and criticizes and with no real connection jumps to the subject of global freezing ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison his wife wakes up and prevents him an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life according to him ali can even sell hot drink if the world faces with global freezing when he returns home suddenly we see that his wife understood his value treating him like a hero and praising his manhood meanwhile the thief boys got sick eating too much ice cream they confess to the doctor that they stole bike ali forgives them and there comes the happy end br br although the plot may look promising in a way it's the story telling which makes this film insincere and cheesy first the director doesn't show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything is based on dialogs and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art even troubles are not convincing because we don't see it we just understand it from his words the director markets his film as a righteous fight of ali against big ice cream companies but there is nothing in the film about big companies we don't see their pressure enough the film actually ridicules ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft and when his motorbike is found it solves every problem ali becomes a happy and powerful husband not a real criticism of br br second the film is cheesy because of the crude humor maybe the people of that part of turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny i may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and clever but they are not clever jokes at all they are just cheesy maybe i'm wrong maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor but american pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the oscars or to have a political message if you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man's big erection in his shorts and we had to endure this joke twice or an old villager woman saying f k you then you may find this film funny
<START> the earlier review is pretty much on target which altman was not with this film i haven't seen it since its original release but i have seldom spent two hours in a theater feeling as miserable and disappointed as i was with this film if some pretentious community theater attempted a sci fi version of a ingmar bergman film it might come off like this i can't bring myself to give anything altman has made a 1 but this is probably the nadir of a career that has had some remarkable highs and lows i would have walked out but as a paid film critic i couldn't think about that the next time you envy movie critics
<START> nice movie at the begining i thought it's a detective kind hi fi movie but the ending totally surprised me i guess the whole movie covers too many subjects each of them can be the main subject e g avenge friendship and dream but it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them i think it'd be a great movie if it's built around the ending from the very begining br br
<START> this is the follow up creation to better off dead in a competition better off dead would win hands down but for star power one crazy summer outshines savage steve's better script problems with one crazy summer casting better off dead bod was cast so much better friendship shows cusack giving hateful looks to bill murray's little bro trouble on the set more outrageous friends in but more genuine friends in bod plot was good you'll predict some of it but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could so even though this is better off dead's ugly stepsister it's worth a look see demi moore before the plastic surgery if for no other reason john cusack fans you gotta see it just to say you have if you don't like bobcat i'm sorry i don't like him either but you can't escape him in this one at least he does a great job in the film doing a tribute to another movie monster editing needed help on the beach but for most part not much to complain about overall it's good and funny but try not to compare it to bod or you'll find it lacking sigh
<START> i am a anthropologist specializing in the field of symbolic and i must say that this film exhibits high quality in the symbolic context throughout the entire film to anyone who has not yet seen this i recommend that you also read man's search for ultimate meaning by victor e i think you will be able to draw some amazing br br that being said i would like to say that despite the fact that the main characters are gay this is not a story about being gay this is a story about seeking out and finding meaning in life despite the difficulties and challenges the pain and terror that stand in your way this is a story of seeking and finding balance and wholeness and happiness
<START> in the european tv industry movies like this one are called stickers tv stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to let's say titanic some not really blockbusters were a part of the deal br br 14 hours is a story of a hospital its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low budget film br br newborn babies are very obviously not real there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor acting the actors are not believable in their roles their lines when spoken sound way too memorized as if this was a read out camera test
<START> based on a true story br br the premise of this film is to illustrate that through fairly normal events its possible for an outwardly mother to get drawn into heroin addiction br br semi spoiler some of the scenes are fairly inaccurate whilst others almost make you want to get the yourself br br computer technician graphic artist woman with good relationship with her young teen kid spirals into addiction after work colleague who is a someone who can take enjoy it now and again then spirals into an addiction that leads her eventually to scoring off dealers after losing contact with her steady dealer br br the scenes that show her coming down and getting 'sick' are often very real especially the first real 'night sweat' prior to all these events she began a relationship with a guy who just happened to have lost his wife to the bottle and insists he has an inner radar not to get hooked on such women some radar however after after some late turn ups and weird behaviour the boyfriend challenges her as to 'what is going on' his radar begins to get more with it and demands that she empty out her bag she hits the roof and storms out br br because of the excellent and open relationship she had developed prior to this tragedy he is the first to 'find' some real evidence in her bag he then looks around the hose for her apparently his sensibility is from school lessons on drug taking and when he discovers a large stash in the bathroom he flushes it not a happy woman when she takes her next bath and its br br the kid keeps one back and places it on the meal table she then goes into further denial admits it and says its no worse than dope br br thge kid does all the right things and calls her friends and generally puts her in a position where she has to come 'clean' if you'll pardon the pun br br the movie takes the viewer through some pretty arduous situations where danger is not far away br br she gets help from a professional organisation and does cold turkey you'll have to watch the film to see what happens next
<START> i have read both the book and saw the movie today the storyline is so powerful that almost any script or screenplay would have done justice to it so nothing much there however this is still a beautiful movie because it makes one think and feel just like the book watching it is not like watching a documentary on a failed state and feeling sympathetic towards people suffering under an oppressive regime but is like watching any other common man's story unfold across generations across continents cowardice his guilt his dilemmas and finally his choosing a way of redemption could have been a story of any of us there isn't a single infallible character to look up to and idolize but all of them are gray just like all of us br br another important observation is that the movie does a great job of chronicling the lives of afghans through the twenty some years of turbulent political scenarios the vibrant care free childhood represents kabul before the russian invasion and the desolate shattered remains of the city echo what the taliban has done to it br br the child actors deserve up' all the way they can put any matured actor to shame br br if you have not yet seen the movie or read the book just walk into the theater keeping in mind that you are going to witness a multi layered story woven on a multi colored fabric of human emotions and sentiments this movie is not meant to stir anti soviet and anti taliban feelings but to feel the trials of human existence br br i read some of the external reviews linked to the site and i must confess i do not see the point in writing reviews that summarize the storyline like a distant spectator and point out technical details about amazing cinematography or something similar at least for this movie one should try to connect to it rather than judging it objectively
<START> it might be that the film i saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw however as the actors are the same i can only think that the cut i saw in europe differed from the one circulating in the us br br anyway this was the worst movie that i saw the past five years closely followed by the waterboy br br why because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one mixed them put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it br br examples nothing the music gets scary and still nothing the grumpy officer us grumpy in a way that would let the actor flunk any acting class thereÂ´s a buddy moment which comes out of nowhere at the end thereÂ´s an inescapable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone br br if you want to see a smart movie see memento if you want to see a better thriller see any thriller that comes to mind if you want to see patrick swayze see dirty dancing
<START> this movie is absolutely terrible definately a bull t story and even worse acting too bad charlie sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies br br the special effects are 'a team' standard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hood br br of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say ' die evil americans' br br unless braindead movies are you game don't spend of your life on this rubbish pick up 'the or 'apocalypse now' instead
<START> a very comical but down to earth look into the behind the scene workings of an australian bowling club the way they deal with various problems such as takeovers and general running of the club not to mention the car parking dilemma was well scripted
<START> this is probably the greatest war film and certainly one of the greatest films there's no sentimentality no patriotic agenda not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this bleak glimpse of what we can only call hell it's this quiet rigor and lack of manipulation that give the film its astounding power there aren't any attempts to make a hero out of protagonist tamura either he's just a poor doomed sap trying to stay alive in a world of horror who hopes but isn't sure he can hang on to his humanity in the process fierce lack of cant and illusion make fires on the plain stand alone ichikawa died february 2008
