<START> formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer vargas it looks very much like a tv movie not really exciting the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it no real surprises here though it is nice to see vargas great looking landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts the chase scenes are standard fare
<START> lifeforce 1985 was a cannon funded film directed by tobe hooper it's a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires who are accidentally brought back down to earth during the latest space shuttle mission steve railsback stars as the sole survivor of the tragedy but really folks the movie is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of mathilda may she's one smoking hot number the director was a huge fan of female vampire a k a miss may recreates lina title role the film is beautifully photographed and directed there's plenty of gore effects to keep genres fans happy br br i have to give this film a very high rating tobe hooper was the man he made three interesting films for cannon during this time period texas chainsaw massacre ii and invaders from mars as well if you like science fiction horror films tobe hooper films or mathilda may this film's just up your alley br br highest recommendation br br did i mention mathilda may is smoking hot
<START> some sort of accolades must be given to hellraiser it's actually out full full moon it bears all the marks of say your demonic toys' or puppet series without their dopey uh charm full moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly these hellraiser things man do they ever take themselves seriously this increasingly stupid franchise though not nearly as stupid as i am for having watched it once made up for its low budgets by being stylish now it's just ish
<START> at last a film to rival 'el and 'darkness falls' in terms of sheer and utter dullness this is actually the first film i've ever given 1 out of 10 for on imdb and with good reason br br for one the cast is nothing special that's usually not a problem for me except that the only character that's in anyways interesting or different from all the rest is grand l bush's harrington secondly the production values a substandard television sci fi such as 'stargate' has more convincing sets and all of the underwater scenes not handled by the sfx teams are filmed on dry sets with that aren't very convincing this film is literally the worst part though is that this film is boring for the first 45 minutes i felt as if we were going round and round in circles it's a prehistoric shark bullsh t no really bullsh t i'm not making this up bullsh t there it is now i didn't see anything let me guess yup bullsh t after then it picks up ever so slightly for about twenty minutes or so then we're back to the dialog run around dialog is not a bad thing but that's all this film has characters talking that too is not a bad thing except this film isn't very good at it the dialog is often contrived and clichÃ©d and is not very interesting to listen to i don't see any point slandering the special effects this film has worse qualities br br the sets are small and unrealistic the acting is sub par the script oh lord the script is worse than a garbage of sci fi television has to dredge up it makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or was br br yet another awful awful addition to the there's about four series of films bring on steve please
<START> golden boy is ecchi humor bordering on hentai in the guise of educational moments the main character kintaro wanders around getting himself into the silliest situations involving women it's just that he's shy on the surface but analyses everything until he can learn something from it the most striking feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his education which are outright embarrassing yet funny at the same time
<START> wow at first i thought who writes these things how hard is that choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth respectability and security as opposed to a husband who offers you only oppression abuse degradation and poverty however our choices are not always as clear cut cut as one would think indeed the wealthy gentleman was all a woman could aspire to and yet the pull of her husband her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming what to do what to do as a viewer you became as confused and misdirected as she was anyway what i really came on this site to gush about was my admiration of the voice of the i thought although it is actually the voice of an irish singer in the film looking him up i find he is glen whom i had never heard of before that day what a find i am so grateful wow what a voice what a day thank you biff
<START> with the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film i don't think that shakespeare is in any great danger this is the story of an ancient aztec mummy who has been disenfranchised his stuff has been taken and this really ticks him off he seems to know who's doing this even though he's a gyrating raving entity i loved the two dull men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature there are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard full of cheap crosses and other junk there's a mausoleum where the mummy is kept i can't begin to reproduce the idiocy of this including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown there is a door next to it so he can crawl out to the robot a mass of metal cans with a guy inside the dialogue is awful there are long pauses between speeches as if someone offstage is feeding them their lines i love the scene where the two little kids accuse their mother of going out at night she goes into this zombie state or something nonetheless if your looking for a film that you can laugh at and never takes itself seriously watch this have a couple beers first like a direct line from the mummy's tomb watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink what more can i say
<START> some films are so badly made they are watchable purely for the cringe factor disciples made me cringe so much it was uncomfortable i watched it all disbelieving what i was watching wasn't anyone aware how bad this was whilst they were filming mix the most hammed performances from the most wooden actors an abysmal script were every comment from all of the 'actors' sounded like it came from the same character and the most hurried editing that tried and failed bigtime to give the film a forced pace all these combined into a film that will rob you of a few hours of your life and give nothing in return avoid at every cost
<START> this movie is not at all like city of god you might get the same feeling but it isn't there's no intense shooting nor intense drug scenes you get the idea if you ask me i think this film was a waste of time there are a lot of other films which gives 100 times better meaning and teaching than wooden camera yes i might be the only one to give a negative comment for this film but it's only in my opinion it's one of those films where i can get the feeling that i'll be blown away but when the credits start to role my friends and i all gave mutual looks and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was so to conclude this matter i advise not to watch it br br personal note making africans talk english was a big mistake in city of god they used their native language which gave the film much more power and reality
<START> complete entertainment although there are many strange things in the movie that the fairy tale itself doesn't have them including the autumn characters mother and daughter the general concept rocks
<START> being a fan of the series i thought how bad can the movie be well i got my answer some movies should never be made why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters the pete character in the series wasn't a whiney little baby as portrayed in the movie the only good thing in this movie besides the music and that clare danes is pretty was that it was short what's with that dance scene the only reason i didn't walk out of this film was because it was so bad it got funny maybe that was the plan it's really bad when a cheap 60's tv show is better then a 90's 20 million dollar film el mariachi cost only and is a much better film don't even waste your money when it comes out on tape it's not even worth renting
<START> raoul walsh's mega epic stunning filmed in an early widescreen process by the great arthur can be slow and static in the early talkie manner but this classic wagon train journey across america to the northwest is thrilling as a sheer physical production when seen on the big screen on t v the lack of close ups and distant sound reproduction may prove daunting young john wayne scores easily in his first starring role with a natural delivery the rest of the cast can't command amazingly the film flopped and wayne spent most of the following decade in grade b western fodder
<START> it should be noted that this movie was not improvised as you're probably thinking of it despite what the title at the end suggests the movie was heavily scripted and rehearsed cassavetes didn't have enough money to support the inevitably high production costs of an improvisational sort of movie even if he had wanted to produce such a thing the improvisation of the movie is contained in the actors' performances and the emotions that they draw out of the lines br br that said allow me to say that this is a stunning work that i'm sure i'll come back to again and again the depths of emotion that cassavetes is able to draw out of the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible i have no idea how he was able to direct such amazing performances out of the actors especially under the conditions he worked this is truly a magnificent landmark of film that i would recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond the hollywood mold
<START> this movie was so bad if anyone out their who starred in the movie are reading this including the director i hate you lol that blonde woman who was running away screaming through the forest at least cry rather than scream and keep doing the dodgy heavy breathing and oh dear god if it was the director who sorted out the cameras on this one then go back to a normal job no one wants to be watching some scared woman's chin throughout it damn don't even think about renting buying or even having a copy of this within 100 radius of your house since it can be harmful to people who like good movies when i got home i thought id rented a movie by the acting and style of the camera
<START> negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times everyone in this movie should attend anonymous you would think an original story could evolve from the general concept young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the pearl harbor bombing it does raise interesting questions but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke the typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd glasses included i could not have been more uninterested in the wooden dialog and clichÃ© characters upon the completion of the movie i had to throw the dvd in the trash stay far away from this dud you won't get the 90 minutes of your life back
