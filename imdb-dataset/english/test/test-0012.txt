<START> this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen the writer obviously bought the playbook how to write a space disaster movie and followed it play by play in particular the stereo typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space putting on a brave show in the face of disaster has been done time and time again br br max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw 50 million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only muster 50 thousand to learn that the film was nominated for a special visual effects emmy has me absolutely gob smacked br br i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects br br and the plot holes are too numerous to mention but i will pick one out as an example now i'm no nasa expert but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear shaped with the program surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty nine year old who has not been in the control room before br br the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script br br i give this film 2 out of 10 with the above average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark
<START> tim curry was the reason i wanted to see this film and while of course his appearance is always entertaining he's basically wasted in it the rest of the cast doesn't fare too well either in this remake of an early zombie movie that has extremely graphic effects that are totally unnecessary to quote a popular axiom sometimes less is more
<START> the women 2008 by diane english is sadly such a waste of talent with annette benning candice bergen bette midler cloris leachman whom i like and enjoy in everything i've seen them and meg ryan jada pinkett smith debra messing and eva mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at how could the movie be boring predictable embarrassing sloppy and simply bad it was made by diane english who is known as the writer of the very successful tv show murphy brown and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script the movie has been a labor of love for english who had tried for many years to make it happen and i respect that i even found the scenes with the supporting players bergen carry fisher and bette in short but memorable cameos funny smart and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand sex and the city which was released few months ago i did not find sex and the city very good when i saw it but next to the women it was simply brilliant at least sex and the city spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her poor debra messing what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we the viewers together with her the movies like the women give the whole genre chick flicks a bad name it is nothing wrong with the genre but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships about dealing with marriage motherhood and proving yourself professionally these are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to why making movies with the lines dialogs and situations so clichÃ©d predictable not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over br br after i saw the new movie i checked out from my local library the original the women and i truly enjoyed it the story was told much better 70 years ago and kept my interest all the way the old movie had a real star power
<START> its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines but ill give it a try just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did to watch this awful and boring movie br br i like patrick swayze he did a excellent performance in films like ghost dirty dancing point break north south tv series but in this movie argh this movie is so the acting is awful the script sucks well i cant even find one good thing nothing absolutely nothing i was watching it with 2 other friends and we all agreed that this was one of the most boring films we had ever seen and the fact that it lasts for more then 3 hours which we didn't know when part 1 was over and it said to be continued we almost cried do we have to watch 90 minutes more of this movie br br its painful to see this movie at no time do you get the impression that the actors are russians the action scenes are extremely bad the only good scene is when the truck explodes in the beginning of the movie the rest is crap go clean your toilet instead of watching this movie and don't come running crying if you do see this movie you were pre warned personally i would recommend patrick swayze to call his agent and have them recall this movie its that bad
<START> the most striking feature about this well acted film is the almost surreal br br images of the era and time it was shot it i could sense the time and moments were stark and very real even the language was so well chosen it's all too often when colloquialisms of today's world are carelessly used in movies about br br another time and place
<START> the final installment in the karate kid series is predictable poorly acted and so bad it borders on the enjoyable but not quite it's just bad in this installment ralph macchio's karate kid is absent already having been in one too many of the episodes the new kid played by hillary swank is the teenage granddaughter of one of mr wwii buddies her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion in steps mr to set things right true to formula there is a group of neo fascist bullies called the alpha troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move called the praying mantis as i said before this movie is a mess and should be avoided
<START> when i saw 6 0 on imdb i was rather impressed and excited to watch this movie as a 6 for a horror movie should be rather entertaining at first i thought it was going to be some disturbing unseen evil force having not read the book to terrify the audience but it turns out to be something rather mundane killer plants regardless i am a rather open minded individual when it comes to movies so i thought perhaps the movie would bring some kind of breakthrough spin on carnivorous vines br br unfortunately it failed to meet my expectations due to the excessive amounts of clichÃ© and lack of any originality to top it off the female lead character continues to annoy you off with her stupidity unless the movie is intentionally a bad b rated movie that is entertaining in the hilarity of badness no movie should ever ever ever have a main character irritate you if one expects the audience to care about the character such roles should be reserved for secondary characters characters were undeveloped the monsters plants in this case left unexplained and clichÃ©s were dripping all over br br the only thing that is mildly effective are some of the bloody gory scenes although the gore pales in comparison with movies like high tension or ichi the killer consistently failed logic such as why would a character not watching the top of a rope during a second attempt at descending into the ruins when it just snapped and almost killed someone even if minor adds up and just continues to anger the audience the movie could've saved itself by using characters or some kind of story device to or redeem idiot characters who just did something stupid or at least let the character recognize or regret her own mistakes but to continue to allow idiocy to preside will certainly cause the audience to abandon all care for the character in turn taking away the terror of the movie br br overall this is a poorly done movie an example of a well done movie involving pretty twenty something's getting killed is the texas chainsaw massacre remake and the prequel too that certainly instilled fear and had much less character logic flaws in summary if you have a lot of time to kill go watch it if there's nothing else otherwise don't waste your time with this sub par flick and go see something actually scary and highly satisfying like the hills have eyes remake
<START> man of the year tells the story of tom dobbs robin williams a political comedian like jon stewart or stephen colbert who has his own television show on his show he talks about all sorts of things but his main focus are political issues which he is very opinionated about one day on his show a fan from the audience raises the idea that dobbs should run for president of the united states after that episode aired millions flocked to the web to create various and voice their opinions on why dobbs would make a great candidate for the president for the united states a few weeks later dobbs decides to run for president and low and behold wins the election everything seems to be going as planned until a woman by the name of eleanor green laura linney shows up and starts some controversy regarding his position a funny yet serious political thriller br br man anyone walking into this film expecting to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed i always wonder how some people are film marketers when i see how misleading their marketing campaigns man of the year is a great example of bad and misleading marketing because everything from the poster to the trailer to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy i would honestly have to say about 1 3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think i kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film addresses pretty serious issues in between its comedy routine br br but enough about marketing lets get down to the film itself br br i really liked man of the year even though i was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film one of the many things i will give this film credit for is that the film does a decent job switching between comedy and drama even though at first it seems a little awkward i really think that after you figure this out that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy you get comfortable with it some may not because they are lead to believe that they are seeing a comedy and don't understand what this film is trying to say in the end but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this film right br br man of the year talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion as tom dobbs speaks he is saying things that need to be said and isn't about candy coating them i also think the whole political subplot while most critics say hurt the film probably again because of the misleading marketing was very good the idea of voting has been tossed around the last few years and with all the problems computers have the issue being addressed in this film could surely be realistic also the control big businesses have over voting also gets addressed br br as far as acting goes i think everyone involved did a good job robin williams had a chance to be funny yet serious at the same time by playing tom dobbs some say that williams has overstayed his welcome as a comedian but i personally still think he is funny and he's a good serious actor as well this is probably one of the few occasions though that we get to see him go back and forth from serious to funny and i think it works well also it's nice to see lewis black co star in a decent film again i like black when he appears on the daily show and does stand up however most of the films he has been in were awful this was a good movie for him because i think his political views fit in with the story that director barry levinson was trying to convey laura linney is a fine addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and lastly christopher walken and jeff goldblum both do a very good job as always with this roles handed to them br br man of the year was written and directed by barry levinson the man who has brought us such films as rain man good morning vietnam and wag the dog levinson does a fine job writing the film and directing it like i said i know a lot of critics didn't like the whole political thriller aspect of the film but i thought it fit in nicely it was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time barry levinson did a fine job with this film br br in the end don't go into this film expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling you it does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama it's not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe i really liked the fact that this film that this film wasn't a typical hollywood film it tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me i like the fact that the film didn't really tone down any of the issues it addressed nor did it have a typical hollywood ending i was trying to call the ending from the get go but surprisingly it didn't end the way i thought which made me happy it's a movie that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later allow you to think and wonder what's going to happen next i think its a good movie that will be hurt by its bad marketing
<START> not all movies are oscar worthy but let's face it sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression this one left me smiling and happy and i couldn't wait to hug my own son anyone who has had a pet no matter what type knows what it feels like to lose one i believe most people would identify with buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth bruce willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and joey lauren adams was convincing as a good mother the little boy who played buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend edgar played terrific backup roles liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy thanks
<START> if you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film it fails at the first post by not being scary or funny it is a dull grey movie that i guess went straight to video hammy and tongue in cheek acting leave a sour taste in the mouth if you want to watch a poor but still watchable recent zombie film watch diary of the dead poor special effects school level script zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point this movie has nothing there is no worthy point that zombification underscores this is as thrilling and convincing as a republican convention no sorry watching the republican convention would be a better example of a zombie movie
<START> in this era when almost everything makes it on to dvd i'm expecting to see the my mother the car collection any day now this film has been unfairly neglected there are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory dvd treatment this one wasn't even released on vhs to my knowledge despite the talents involved in the making arthur hiller eli wallach anne jackson murray notable later for co writing tootsie even dustin hoffman in his debut it's obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era all films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made this was released the same year as the president's analyst another absurd masterpiece that film was finally released on dvd and has developed a cult following this film has many memorable bizarre goofy wacky moments sure it's painted in broad strokes and has silly go go music throughout but that's part of its charm it creates its own absurd universe if whoever is in charge of dvd production for columbia pictures releases i believe columbia released it takes polls for new releases this gets my vote
<START> i must be getting old because i was riveted to this movie from the first time i saw it i'm watching it again right now on hbo it's a very simple film about 2 people that fall in love after they found out that there spouses were having an affair plot is very thin but the actors acted very well in this movie in the mix of kristen scott thomas running for congress and harrison ford being an internal affairs cop these two meet under unfortunate circumstances and fall in love i love the soundtrack perfect fit one thing i can't figure out this movie had a budget of 68 million dollars were was it spent the plane crash or harrison ford's salary
<START> the premise of this film is the only thing worthwhile it is very poorly made but the idea was clever if not entirely original it's a shame the other aspects of the film weren't better the acting is especially bad
<START> if you're looking for a movie that puts you to sleep then heart of darkness is the movie for you the book wasn't what i expected to it to be and the movie disappointed me even further the cast list was pitiful and the all around plot was pathetic and was not like the book except for a few scenes i understand that everyone has their own point of view as they read heart of darkness and they create their own movie in their head but they director cuts important scenes and adds pointless ones if there was someone in the movie who was supposed to be of a certain culture they should've used an actor that was of that culture there are actors from every where and i'm sure that they could've found better ones to fit the roles joseph conrad was a respectable man and created a book that will entertain you if that's what you're looking for but the movie was cheap and pointless and someone who could make the movie as respectable as the book should've done it if you want a movie that drags you into darkness then heart of darkness is the movie for you
<START> in spite of its high minded ambitions film must be seen as a failure it's one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist which i think is what was attempting it's another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and meaninglessly episodic despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location and a wonderful score the film never lures the audience in too much is unintentionally funny the phony sound of dripping water in drago's quarters for example or the silent movie mugging by some of the actors or simply confusing why exactly does drago want to leave the fort the first time for the film to succeed as a coherent work
