<START> first i must say that i don't speak spanish and usually do not enjoy spanish speaking films but two coyotes is an exceptional film there is enough action and hard drama that it doesn't matter that its a spanish speaking film the subtitles were easy to read and didn't block the action or the drama br br i would tell fans of spanish speaking films and non fans of spanish speaking films to go see this movie the action and drama are worth every penny br br
<START> but you can see it from here br br i definitely don't understand why anyone would recommend this movie not a bit of plot not suspenseful not well made no point to having made it really br br completely forgettable in ever way
<START> this might be my favorite so bad it's awesome film of all time like many pre teen children of the 80's repeat viewing of revenge of ninja spawned a ninja phase of my childhood man i thought sho k was badass back then jet li could him with both legs in a cast this movie has insane crossovers that include flashdance the exorcist and the lee van cleef ninja tv show ugh but as a friend of mine says anyone can get a good movie made it takes true genius to make a film that starts with a ninja surviving 17 shotgun blasts long enough to take over the body of instructor to get revenge wow while previous commentors have the sword flying out of the closet on the string no one has yet the powerful love scene where the sexy leading man cop takes off his shirt to reveal a mane of the fun never ends rent this
<START> the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever there is something about them that makes them special i think it s the feeling you get when you watch them br br they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700 s or 1800 s i think it has some thing to do with the set s that are used if so then it s working keep it up guy s br br in a quick round up of what s happened in the first part was supposedly from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite the blood stone and all his father has so he kill s his father who is played by angus scrimm the tall man from the phantasm movies and takes the blood stone which has power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough well s brother stephan try s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling with a tourist who is staying at a house fort which belongs to a friend of his br br well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in br br i will review comment on the other sequels soon br br the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although does not look as good as the wonder full sarah michelle gellar br br rating for this movie 10 10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done br br
<START> the truth and reconciliation process in south africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness we all need to understand ways of dealing with the past what's happening in south africa should guide us all i found it credible moving and at times upsetting there were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative once again the bbc has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie
<START> there was a recent documentary on making movies that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what its like to make movies one common theme was you can have a great script great cast the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie br br down periscope is proof of the corollary to that theory not an original or terribly well written screenplay a few solid actors but mostly unknowns and this movie just makes you laugh out loud it would be easy to just say that kelsey grammar carried this movie but that isn't truly the case other character actors like rob schneider and the hilarious harland williams added significantly to the enjoyability of the film br br cast dynamics or that mysterious movie magic are really what happened here creating a film that flows smoothly has incredibly well executed transitions and line after line of well written and well performed dialog br br a preposterous premise lots and lots of technical inaccuracies and just plan silly things that could not happen in the real world or the real navy but you just don't care as a merchant marine myself i found that the overall feel of the movie while not plausible was also not too far off the mark as far as life at sea goes br br this is a very funny movie a good family film and particularly if your a fan lots of kelsey grammar wit sarcasm and just damn

<START> all credit to writer director gilles who fashioned this winding twisting tale of deceit and betrayal while keeping the utmost control he maintains the audience at arm's length never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on even his clever denouement has you guessing br br the three central performances are also top class with vincent cassel and monica bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery jean phillippe supplements strength in his supporting role to give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair br br thierry uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma and editing keeps the story a step ahead of us the theme from peter chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script br br many may say gilles is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love for me this is simply a haunting elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web only the french are capable of such hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending br br monday march 2 1998 hoyts croydon br br no one does thriller quite like the french when they get it right they really get it right br br vincent cassell is intriguing as the deceptive max obsessive as the new lisa and monica bellucci is mysterious as the first lisa the plot from gilles is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires br br all credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot and the performances from the three leads as lucien jean phillippe is strong and emotional br br friday january 15 1999 video
<START> the buddy holly story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 texas as the credits start the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot into the roller rink past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check it's a tracking shot welles and scorcese would both appreciate it cuts to buddy holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio br br a young gary busey plays buddy holly and his performance is key he has to somehow show the passion that holly had for his music to make the film work this is a rock and roll story without lines of coke chased with shots of heroin and a fifth of whiskey this isn't about a man with several women to choose between in a sex brood abandoned lusty tragedy this is a film about a nice texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll busey finds that spark and ignites it his passion is clear and infectious he really plays the guitar in the film and sings its not overdubbed with holly's recordings busey was a young guy in hollywood in the seventies a struggling actor and as much or more so a struggling rock musician as well thus he gives a great performance because although he isn't buddy holly he's in a similar situation br br his first song is the old les paul classic mockingbird hill and he has the country twang to nail it next a kid calls out for some bop and against his two band mates in reality the crickets were 3 guys but the down sizing works fine for the film's limited narrative he leads them wailing into rocking with ollie vee the kids love it and the parents hate it the dj at the rolling rink tapes it and it is later released in new york without buddy holly even knowing it was ever recorded this leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments an amped up disc jockey from buffalo calls up buddy at home the dj has been playing that'll be the day for 12 hours and is going for 24 the cops are banging on the station's barricaded door holly is confused but when the dust settles he is quite thrilled he tells the boys and their meteoric rise begins dan stroud as the drummer and charles martin smith as the bassist round out the band nicely and have good chemistry with each other there are problems but not overblown drama thats found in most rock all biopics the movie doesn't manipulate you either your emotions soar but they're not manipulated when the crickets step onto the apollo stage in harlem the first white group ever to play there then rip into an electrically charged performance of oh boy and win the audience over my rock and roll loving ass got choked up and cried next busey and the boys make it's so easy sound and more soulful than i would have believed possible br br anyone with even a cursory knowledge of buddy holly's story will know where this movie will end holly died in a plane crash with richie and the big bopper way too young we as the audience know that yet the movie is so well written directed and lovingly acted that we forget it almost immediately the movie isn't about his death it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history the film ends with his last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of busey rocking out possessed by the ghost of buddy holly i was happy to hear him end it on not fade away my favorite of his songs the film freezes before the end credits with the information about the plane crash but i hardly noticed it i was still thinking about how good that last song was
<START> i also have been a wife of an abusive husband even if in my situation the attacks were psychological not physical he presented a very respectable responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together which in contrast to myself resulted in having others treat me as dull and unstable initially i was so incredibly flattered that anybody like gus who worked in a bank and was handsomely confident would even give me the time of day and i fell completely head over heels for the idea of him rather than the person he was if i'd had my head on straight and gotten to know him much better first there's no way i'd have married him however that's my mistake it wasn't my mistake to be abused i didn't deserve that nor did i see it coming until i was embroiled in the mind games criticism and isolation he acted like i had no business holding an opinion that differed from his own actually he went further if i didn't agree he assumed i misunderstood and increasingly simplified his wording by the time i finally lost my self respect i was incapable of recognizing the predicament i was in and i had to be jolted to reality by outside influence my dad said gus called me a bitch well it was still a half year before the rage that began at that moment finally exploded and i packed some stuff while he was at work and i left and it was still another several months before i could grasp the fact that i had been abused and that it wasn't my fault he was doing the things he did so please anyone who assumes it's the fault of the victim think if a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner when in an anxious situation it has an accident on the rug do you blame the puppy by the time the abuse in a relationship reaches an obvious violent level the target of abuse has been so wounded and much like in nazi concentration camps that it's nearly impossible to judge the circumstance accurately because by then the victim believes all the horrible things spewed by the abuser have a heart people labelling abuse victims as stupid morons is like kicking someone who's already terribly beaten and this helps how
<START> ocean's 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on like a celebrity awards presentation each major actor actress is introduced in short 60 second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking applaud now sign the first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed poorly edited and at times utterly unrelated to the story and confusing speaking of the story there is one kinda but its barely visible for all the look at me shots and cameos only matt damon seemed to actually act during this film the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat pack wanna be session as for the heist the action the drama it was put into the last 8 10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic horrible horrible horrible
<START> many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare however every so often a movie might come along thats honest funny entertaining and memorable the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients this film follows three friends gary rick and david the big apple misadventures into the world of first time sex and true love along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship we follow hopeless romantic gary the main character on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it's ending if you haven't been lucky enough to see this movie yet by all means take a look sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace l a v truly is an original film a rarity among films of it's genre
<START> one night i was listening to talk radio and they had leslie nielsen on the program he went on to explain why there were only 6 shows ' br br with tv shows like mash you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you didn't miss anything but with police squad you had to watch the show with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you didn't see them who could forget the part of town known as little italy with the coliseum in the background br br even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags but then again being in the theater you were a captive audience br br leslie also said the one reason the show movies and other movies like airplane were funny is because they didn't attempt to tell what was funny it was up to the viewer to get the jokes br br well that's just my 2 cents
<START> i hate to admit it but i didn't find it to be one of hitchcock's best but nonetheless a riveting climatic thriller in a remake of hitchock's 1934 movie of the same title dr ben mckenna james stewart Â the man who knows too much and his wife jo mckenna doris day are in morocco with their son hank christopher when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot the conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot kidnapping their beloved hank br br i found it surprising that doris day who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies was cast in a hitchcock film as i was watching it i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcock's other works example psycho and she had singing ability needed to pull off que sera sera which she did beautifully she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry which helped make the couple believable br br in comparison to the great director's other works i believe this isn't as good but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller mystery there is also the added bonus of que sera sera which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day well directed well acted a fine film
<START> seems sensei seagal is getting more and more moralising and less action packed to date this has to be his worse movie no action a poor story line an impossible plot and to make things worse one of the endings i have ever seen br br seagal films are like seeing a dirty harry you do not go see it for the great social causes or impeccable acting you want a good action flick br br on a scale of 1 to 10 this one gets a 1
