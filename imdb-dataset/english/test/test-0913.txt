<START> i viewed my videotape last night for the first time in at least ten years i found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory george of course was the master of the role of sweeney there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance at least not until the end when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife angela lansbury on the other hand creates a more complex portrayal as mrs lovett she understood that sondheim wanted that role to be something of a comic counterpart to sweeney and even brings some tenderness into her courtship of sweeney and her nurture of the boy tobias for those with long memories this performance takes one back to her debut performances in the picture of dorian grey and gaslight long before murder she wrote only a year ago i saw the musical at lyric opera of chicago with current opera superstar as sweeney others have commented on the operatic quality of the score my conclusion is that sweeney works better with actors who can at least handle the vocal lines than with opera performers who have limited acting skills as a final note i commend the performer who portrayed tobias with his mixed loyalties and confusion about what is going on around him it seemed appropriate that he had virtually the last word
<START> in my opinion this movie is not good i hardly find a good thing to say about it but still i would like to explain before i conclude it is just another bad movie br br i decided to watch it because costas mandylor is starring in it and that was the main reason i watched it till the end i like action movies and i understand that such movies are built on the action rather than the story i know they don't go into details when it comes to the credibility of the story and the events but even that does not explain why some scenes just because they lack the sense of reality look ridiculous br br at the beginning the movie looks quite promising a tough good looking specialist and his not so tough but smart and funny partner must do a job which turns out a bit different than they expected the story takes place on a cruise ship a disaster happens the ship is turned over and only a few are left alive during their struggle to survive they have to escape a shark a professional killer and the rising water br br furthermore the movie is quite violent the main weapon beside the disaster which already took out most of the passengers is the gun which is successfully used in many cases i personally missed a good man to man or woman to woman if you prefer fight family fun i don't think so br br all in all i think this movie was shot in a hurry without a real vision what it is trying to say made of the usual action movie tricks with a bit of something called love and without a real meaning it just results in a bad movie
<START> hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years but none stranger than this why this movie got made i will never know nor how paramount could have thought it would sell any tickets in 1947 it is the strangest mix of genres i have seen in a long time a movie that truly does not know whether it is trying to be a serious war drama or a viennese operetta comedy br br it tells the story of a british spy trying to get a poison gas formula out of germany in the days just before ww ii began ray milland a fine actor is stuck playing the part like an escapee from monty python all very exaggerated english prep school dialogue in germany he meets a gypsy marlene dietrich who helps him to travel under cover as of course another gypsy she plays her part like the typical viennese operetta gypsy caricature as do the other gypsies in the movie but there are also nazis who are not funny at all and then milland finds he is starting to think like a gypsy and that is not treated as a joke sometimes the music is for a light comedy sometimes for a drama every time the nazis show up the film score plays wagner which is funny by itself br br this movie could have been a comedy or it could have taken the plight of the gypsies seriously and done a serious job of showing how the nazis treated them both are hinted at in this movie but neither pursued what we are left with is a truly strange mish mash of genres that must have embarrassed everyone except the director involved br br bizarre
<START> this is a movie about people receiving a love letter nobody knows who sent in and nobody knows who it is for a good cast headed up by kate capshaw tom selleck and ellen degeneres this however is a completely dopey plot as an example the capshaw character one of the leading citizens of a small town in new england takes up with an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer she chooses him instead of tom selleck the town firefighter who is crazy about her if that isn't the epitome of stupidity i don't know what is just an example of how dopey this movie is watching kate capshaw jog is a pleasure but you immediately realize that she has never a day in her life another obviously dopey part of a dopey movie
<START> key west for too short a time was appointment tv for my family i'd stop by red lobster and pick up a party tray for the night it was on the irony of the situation was that i was working for a fox affiliate at the time and every one at the station was incensed at them not renewing the show everyone in that cast was excellent fisher stevens perfect who couldn't fail to identify with an everyman who dreams of being a writer in key west jennifer tilly was always remarkable and she is one heck of a texas player you can still find the pilot episode on youtube wish they'd post the hurricane one that episode alone should have won an emmy as well as the rest of the cast
<START> a group of people goes deep into the jungle for various reasons and finally find a lost city where apparently king solomon's diamonds are and a race of super gorilla's now you know you're in trouble when you put fine actors like linney and curry in one movie that stars a talking gorilla and that is just the beginning okay what else br br for an action adventure movie the film is well lacking just that the first hour of the movie they aren't even in the jungle just trying to get there with subplot after subplot something about a local military regime whatever and when they finally do it's just no fun anymore br br the effects of the movie are only so and so and really bad compared to the earlier jurassic park movie br br now the ending the father not caring for the death of his son but just interested in the diamonds uh huh only in the movies folks only in the movies br br a complete waste of talent this jurassic park twister er adaptation 2 10
<START> russell t davies has been tasked with re creating a slice of my childhood hiding behind the sofa watching scary monsters battle with dr who he and his crew are clearly all true devotees of the original series br br in much the same way as the star trek movies used their budget to make the gene original concept far more believable russell t davies has both money and the advantages of excellent cgi to create the best monsters ever i am sure that this series was made with a budget that anticipated both export and dvd sales and it really feels as if no expense was spared br br the accompanying series dr who confidential shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind the scenes insight interviews with the cast and writers help retell the story from each characters perspective and are far more useful than simply watching the whole programme over again br br how does david tenant rank in the pantheon of his illustrious predecessors time will tell but tonight seeing billie piper play alongside elisabeth who was the doctor's companion in the 1970's confirm that she has both the acting ability screen presence and script to be the no 1
<START> best years of our lives is a film that slipped under my radar for years i had heard about it but never had the opportunity to watch it thanks to tcm on demand i was able to watch it uncut and commercial free br br what surprised me about this film was how quickly it was made after the war the film frankly deals with the people who were wounded in the war both physically and mentally it manages neatly to encompass nearly all the varieties of war experience within three characters br br we have the air force officer who was a veteran of the early european bombing campaign because of the horrific rate amongst the crews of the bombers the air force at that time had a reputation for cranking out officers who quickly rose through the ranks such was case with this fellow who went from a lowly soda jerk in civilian life to a captain and bombardier of his b 17 he also suffers from ptsd called battle fatigue at the time br br we have the army non com who served in the pacific and suffered through the horrors of that campaign his story is opposite that of the air force fellow in that he goes from a prestigious job as a banker to a lowly grunt in the army and rises to the rank of sergeant from the stripes on his sleeve it is clear that he is the highest level of sergeant yet he is still on the front line br br finally we have the navy seaman who is part of the faceless support staff commonly referred to as rear echelon by the fellows on the line ironically he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic below decks on a navy ship his ship is struck presumably by a kamikaze and is sunk with loss of 400 lives he is pulled from the water but his badly burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks br br tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane they have boarded for home and how they readjust into civilian society br br what impressed me most about this film is that despite the obvious issues that face the three protagonists it never descends into melodrama the navy kid played by an actual amputee is placed into situations where we might feel sorry for him yet the script never lets us feel that emotion the army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic and the story points that out but never dwells on it the air force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he soda jerked in now bought out by a large chain and take a demeaning job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife br br the script allows plenty of opportunities for all these characters to come to some dramatic climax regarding their plights but it neatly avoids that but for the overly dramatic score the director has tread around exploiting the obvious br br in one scene that well represents the entire movie the daughter of the army sergeant frederic march is having a discussion with her father and mother regarding the air force captain despite his marriage they have fallen in love and she is determined to break up the marriage which is obviously troubled now we've seen thousands of scenes typical of this where the father blusters angrily and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears slamming the door and falling on the bed later mom shows up consoles daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom and everybody lives happily ever after br br in this scene plays out completely differently than the clichÃ© i have described above sure the conversation gets heated but all parties are reasonable and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialog i have seen br br ultimately is a highly satisfying film with honest performances from the entire cast technically it is well shot the editing and cinematography frame but never overshadow the gripping narrative despite the score which is clichÃ© and over dramatic i give this film the highest rating that it clearly deserves
<START> the movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts but it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the feeling br br as keith richards remarks in paul mccartney's movie about holly there's some buddy holly in almost all rock made since his day the tragedy that took him is dealt with gently and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music br br gary busey does a remarkable energetic portrayal of holly and his performances hint that he really gets into the music as a long time holly fan and rocker so do i
<START> my mother took me to this movie at the drive in when i was around seven years old which is thirty years ago she had no idea a family movie would be so violent my clearest memory was of the boy's father's face of pain as he was stabbed in the stomach and killed this image haunted me for weeks i had learned that i lived in a world where a person might stab my father at anytime how could i stop them how could my father protect himself you must realise that this stabbing is not fantasy to a seven year old it is as real as witnessing an actual event and has no place in a child's innocent mind it is sad that we still do not understand the impact that bringing violence into the lives of our children has both on our children and our society if only parents would protect their children from images of violence with the same vigor that they protect them from images of nudity and sex
<START> the evil below starts on 'the straits of san sebastian as the 17th century treasure ship the el diablo sinks in a violent thunderstorm jump to 'the straits of san sebastian present day' where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral that are rich in wildlife the come across the sunken wreck of the el diablo explore it but are attacked killed by something that looks like a vicious eel captain max cash wayne crawford owns runs a boat for hire named the which caters for tourists who want to fish dive generally explore the islands sarah livingstone june chadwick is an art teacher who dives for treasure as a hobby well we all have to do something to pass the time right she hires max his scantily clad assistant tracy sheri able so she can try to locate the el diablo get rich talk of sunken treasure excites some of the more unscrupulous members of the local community as they dodge the criminals thugs it is brought to max sarah's attention that the el diablo has a sinister past a past that supposedly still leaves it's supernatural legacy behind even now br br directed by jean claude dubois according to the imdb with a little help from star crawford although the version i saw only listed dubois i thought the evil below had some potential is a bit different but unfortunately that's not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a stone the script by arthur payne starts off ok with the two divers being killed by some sort of sea creature but this opening is never referred to again the creature is never seen again there are no more supernatural killings the evil below then suffers from a serious terminal case of identity crisis it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be as it chucks bits pieces of various genres in there from underwater adventure horror action thriller crime it even has time to throw in a little murder mystery religious nonsense as well as a result the evil below feels very bitty fragmented since the best scene in the entire film is the opening sequence i found myself sat there becoming more more frustrated at the lack of any consistent horror as it went downhill rapidly the fact we never see the sea creature thing again the evil below is dull slow uneventful predictable silly lacks any sort of charm or intelligence in short the evil below doesn't do anything right that a good film should br br director dubois fails to liven things up although he obviously shot plenty of underwater wildlife material as at times i thought i was watching a national geographic documentary with all the shots of fish coral the wildlife in general forget about any gore some blood stained water blood coughing is about as gory as it gets i'm afraid br br technically the evil below is very basic it's bland totally forgettable apart from nice underwater photography of fish this is point shoot stuff as a whole the production values are very low even the place where this was shot doesn't look very sunny or appealing the acting is poor but then again did you expect anything else br br the evil below is a poor film it's basic story is all over the place it can't decide what it wants to be as a result it ends up being a mess add that to the low production values the fact there's no gore here absolutely minimal horror content you have a film that is probably best avoided unless your absolutely desperate even then surely there are better ways to spend 90 plus minutes of your life
<START> this was a fantastically funny film why won't they show it again tim healy was superb as were all the players direction was inspired and some of the gags were matchless the pitch had me on the floor show it again itv so i can video it
<START> really for a short film that looks high budget this is just a candy coated piece of cr p it tries so hard to be hollywood but even hollywood stories have an okay story sometimes money wasted on an effort to be hollywood waste of almost a half hour of any viewers time for the short film buff look elsewhere
<START> another b movie for teenagers based mainly on cgi effects industrial soundtrack and some medieval imagery it's a pitty that the legend for beowulf is used in such uninspired manner i am a fan of christopher lambert but i have to admit that he is getting worse as an actor and his movies too rent it if you are teenager only
<START> the production values for this film make it fall short of hollywood blockbuster status and the script makes it fall short of cult status what is left is a tired formulaic attempt at the disaster movie genre that will disappear with the ebb tide br br a decent cast are either miss cast or cannot be bothered the beautiful joanne whalley is unable to bring any gravitas to the role of police commissioner nash who wears the most irritating matching waist clincher above her skirt br br plays the heavyweight part of director of the thames barrier with all the conviction of a fairground candy floss her canadian nationality and accent were presumably drafted in to appeal to a transatlantic audience it and she fails her initial appearance in a tight fitting pink jogging suit as she arrives at work is risible br br the part of the siren old git who was right is played by tom as though he is acting in his sleep and the various plot twists that are designed to his son played by robert carlyle struggle to get any response from him br br nigel looks determined to commit ritual hari kari for his failings as met office director or for his acting or both and only david suchet emerges with some credit for his role as deputy pm br br there was enough in the story and the cast and the effects to have produced a decent effort alas that did not happen
