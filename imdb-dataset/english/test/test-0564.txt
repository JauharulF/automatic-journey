<START> and nothing else br br one of my friends bought the problem child tantrum pack contains the first two problem child s in one disc and we decided to watch the sequel because it was funnier br br there were many funny moments in the movie the vomit scene that's all i need to say nippy the dog after eating chow down and numerous others the movie is nothing but toilet humor but it's hilarious other than the funny moments though this movie has little to offer br br john ritter annoys the crap out of me because it sounds like he's reading out of a book the man can't act in this one sorry br br although i can't say if i would find the movie funny now we were blown when we watched it it's a perfect movie for a rainy day but nothing else don't expect oscar material on this one guys
<START> to put it simply mind of mencia is the worst unfunniest show on comedy central and quite possibly all of television ever i love comedy central and watch many shows and movies there all the time but every time the intro for this show even starts after some good comedy i can't find the remote fast enough br br mencia tells used worn out racial jokes in a bad attempt at being controversial then will point out the ethnicity he just talked about in the audience as if to say 'they liked it so all of your race likes it and by extension me too' give me a break mencia i don't know if those people are plants or not but just because you go to a black guy and high five him after one of your ridiculous jokes doesn't mean he thinks you're funny it just means you put him on the spot and what else is he going to do smack you on tv he gives the impression that his jokes are deep meaningful and thought provoking which is apparent in his commercials but when you actually watch the show almost 100 of what he says is common sense he also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes but you don't have to be any smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that maybe you need to go finish 3rd grade carlos the guy goes on to say that he says what others are only thinking but i think you'll find that if anyone was thinking what he says they figured out all on their own that it was ridiculous and that's why they never said it in the first place br br all in all watch 1 episode and be done with it if you must because after you've seen 1 episode you've seen them all why comedy central keeps renewing this horrible show is well beyond me if you're looking for good comedy look elsewhere because you will find very little of it here
<START> this is one of a rarity of movies where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka to be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man mo and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film br br the cinematic aspect of wolfgang something's photography seems to have left out both close ups and breasts mo and wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses plastic holding passion there's also beetle banging as violet would have put it this plastic peen goes up your butt the rat porn and subsequent rat smashing is awesome br br alright so if you are still reading let us explain who we are mo teaches at nyu and we are a group of her students who finishing a film class with her decided to get poop faced and watch here directorial debut she also wrote uptown girls i can't tell you how much that's been hammered into our skulls so this movie is quite the experience at the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we created for this movie br br about 13 minutes into this game none of us could see straight the sheer amount of in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant there was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit on a kurt cobain lookalike with absolutely no context save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he was oh so naturally reading a local newspaper because that's what we all do the heart shaped glasses were delightfully derivative of lolita and something about that provocative scene of the nude chin up boy suggests the director's history of homosexual pornographic experiments we wish we were kidding br br enough intellectual contemplation on to the drinking game this will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one it's very simple and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care br br the mo ripe drinking game 1 every time you see anything related to pornography take a drink 2 every time you see auteur mo name appear take a drink 3 sex 4 plastic peen require two drinks 5 any time somebody points a gun at another character take a drink at this point you will probably need to pee pee any remaining sobriety from your body 6 any time there is blood including lady blood please take a sip 7 the underused hula hoop girl requires one drink per second 8 gratuitous use of the magic black man requires one drink 9 if you can't figure out the through line keep drinking 10 whenever you are able to predict a line take a drink trust us it's easy br br that's it internet keep drinking and try not to get riped br br hawaiian punch jr
<START> we just saw this movie in austin texas at the alamo south lamar yesterday afternoon it had me laughing out loud many times the scene about albert einstein's thoughts on humanity hit me over and over and i couldn't stop laughing it's too bad it's not in more theaters i know a lot of friends that are dieing to see this movie welcome to costco i love you great work to all involved also if you see it make sure to stay until the end of the credits as well i'm going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure if you're a fan of office space and beavis and butthead then you have to go see this movie it's a classic and no one knows that it's out so if you're in the mood to see something funny this weekend definitely check it out
<START> so i guess that bud and lou just liked to mess with classic stories although they did have some interesting results in this case they're baby sitting a bad boy and lou tries to read him jack and the but falls asleep and dreams that he's jack and bud's the butcher and they climb the to rescue the prince and princess from the giant buddy baer br br i think that my favorite scene was when lou was trying to make the giant an omelet and well i'll let you see what happens as this was an abbott and costello movie they did have a few unnecessary songs but other than that it was pretty funny for other interpretations of the classic story bewitched and gilligan's island both had episodes portraying it

<START> this movie has a great chase scene if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other it sounds very much like the soundtrack from the movie bullet you'll hear the shifting of a 4 speed and they'll show the brake pedal in roy schneider's car it's an automatic brake pedal i think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad guy richard lynch is looking at the driver of the car they are in like the guy is nuts the crook who runs the garage is also the guy who in the the first rocky movie boss good movie also when the door gets ripped off you can see the guy sitting in the car just flinging the door open the guy who helps him out of the car kind of looks like mr brady from the brady bunch doesn't he
<START> i'm always surprised given that the famous title track of 2001 is called also that nobody nobody i've read anyway has noted the parallels between the movie and nietzsche's famous work also the idea of man's rebirth into a star child an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being is an explicit part of n 's there is a prominent passage called on how a camel becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child in which n describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child transcending both the altruistic side of man the camel always asking to bear more weight and the rapacious brutish will to power side of man the lion the fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence and also said that man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman the structure of the movie fits that description a brief history of man as beast until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason then a long sequence about man the rope as it were and then a brief glimpse of the overman the of how these transformations occurred and the suggestion that an external force caused them is also nietzschean in he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider to show us how to go under bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near end could be seen as kubrick's best 1960's style attempt at depicting the mystical going under br br i know these parallels are pretty broad and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that i have not personally seen it but i just wanted to mention them if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy and it is in my opinion explicitly and unmistakeably nietzschean the case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of updated for the modern age feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to nietzsche
<START> the only way i can feel good about having handed over these precious minutes of my life is everyday telling someone how awful it was and even if i say it once a day every day for the rest of my life i will not fully get my point across just dumb br br there's a difference in movies like this and movies like elephant or fat guy goes two of my other least favorite movies the latter two were terrible yes but that was that evan almighty takes a strong cast and attempts to kill them all wanda sykes jonah hill john goodman and steve carrell why god why all these people have much better talent now every time i see any of them i will think of this terrible movie br br the only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 was when i saw the movie there was a mentally challenged elderly woman who thought the barrage of bird poop and getting hurt by tools while building jokes were so funny that she didn't stop laughing the entire time nearly stroking out at several times
<START> in april 1947 new york city faced an epidemic crisis eugene a rug arriving from mexico had arrived in the city bringing with him the deadly smallpox virus he stumbled off a bus complaining of fever and a headache and soon died in a hospital but not before he had infected a dozen passers by the damage was already done for the first time in decades smallpox stalked the streets of new york the city's health authorities acted quickly to isolate sufferers and contain the virus enacting a free vaccination campaign that saw over six million new yorkers against smallpox thanks to their swift response the virus was contained with minimal casualties the outbreak nevertheless must have left an indelible mark for several years later it was followed by two similarly themed film noir thrillers in which doctors must track down a single contagious carrier in a city of millions elia kazan's 'panic in the streets 1950 ' and earl lower budget 'the killer that stalked new york 1950 ' br br film unfolds in an unglamorous docu drama style reed hadley's narration sounds as though it was plucked straight from a newsreel reciting facts as if reading off the official police transcript this technique does feel a little cheap at times but fortunately the narration is largely restricted to the film's bookends as well as providing some explanatory filler during breaks in the plot the killer stalking new york in this story is not a rug from mexico but beautiful diamond smuggler sheila bennet evelyn keyes who has just arrived from cuba within days sheila has two parties independently pursuing her a treasury agent barry kelley looking to arrest her for smuggling crimes and a team of doctors led by william bishop who have identified her as the source of the smallpox outbreak as in 'panic in the streets ' an otherwise routine manhunt is given a heightened sense of urgency particularly when those in pursuit initially have no idea as to the identity or appearance of their suspect br br 'the killer that stalked new york ' for the most part manages to sidestep its low production budget aside from a select few lines of dialogue we have to stop it exclaims dr wood at one point as though coming to a difficult decision the filmmakers and cast members allow the story to unfold in a realistic engrossing fashion indeed in this regard the low budget quite possibly aids the film's intentions necessitating a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the outbreak scenario evelyn keyes is excellent in the leading role showing obstinate resilience in the face of unimaginable torment by the film's end she appears so brutally incapacitated by her illness that it's almost painful to look at her face aside from the virus charles is the main villain of the piece as sheila's greedy and adulterous husband who rest assured gets everything that's coming to him and if all nurses looked like dorothy malone perhaps catching smallpox wouldn't seem like such a bad break after all
<START> detective burt williams has been on the trail of the infamous poe killer for nearly three years burt's daughter kris williams a homicide agent for the fbi along with her partner sean michaels take over burt reluctantly steps down from the case and retires for the next seven months the poe killer continues his murderous rampage until kris discovers that the killer uses internet chat rooms to seduce his prey she logs in as annabel lee and is quickly captured by poe killer it's time for burt to find the sadist and free his daughter before it's too late amateurish and supremely braindead horror flick with no suspense and a bit of nasty gore the acting is hilariously terrible the characters are painfully dumb and the killer is not menacing still i have seen worse indie horror flicks 3 out of 10
<START> spoilers spoilers the cell 2000 out of four br br do you believe there is a part of yourself deep inside in your mind with things you don't want other people to see during a session when i'm inside i get to see those things br br catherine deane br br and so do we one of the most visually stimulating films of the year the cell is a love hate movie either you love it or you hate it i can understand the reasons some people dislike this production with a story that combines disturbing serial killers with mind probing the cell is too much for some viewers others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film i think it's one of the year's most engrossing films br br making his feature film screenwriting debut mark creates an imaginative world of rich colorful images and provocative characters the filmmakers take advantage of every shot conceived ideas for the cell in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his major interests mind probing and serial killers he was reportedly influenced by such directors as wes craven george romero and david cronenberg they would probably be proud of such an imagination br br the film combines two major narratives one about scientific exploration of the human mind and the other about a psychopath who murders young women for his own sexual pleasure catherine deane jennifer lopez a child therapist is part of a neurological study at the campbell center a research clinic because of her empathetic personality scientists chose deane to enter the mind of a catatonic preteen in hopes to revive his brain into waking br br a sick demented serial killer roams the streets within an abandoned rural farmhouse vincent d'onofrio locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies the killer escapes from the fbi every time they draw near until now a violent seizure renders him comatose the fbi captures his forever unconscious body unfortunately he already prepared the cell with his latest victim in forty hours the cell will fill with water and is the only man who knows the location of his victim br br the fbi takes this situation to campbell center where catherine enters the mind of hoping to discover the location of his latest victim before the cell fills with water sending the woman to a watery grave br br the science fiction portions of the story relied on both real science and theoretical fiction in the creation of the neurological and transfer system the premise takes a long time to develop but it is worth the wait it is far fetched but that doesn't matter the film makes us believe even if you don't suspend disbelief however the visual enticement provides an engaging setting to enjoy br br according to the film's production notes mark was thrilled to work with the director named because they both think visually singh is known for his attention to detail stunning art direction and highly developed abilities to tell a story when i wrote 'the explains i surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of painter's paintings or photographs while i was working so i'm thinking visually and is a highly visual director has a similar frame of visual references which made for a very smooth collaboration br br vincent d'onofrio provides the film with a backbone and no actor could have accomplished his character any better he delivers a mysterious disturbing and engaging performance i think that my character is in a way trapped in himself d'onofrio ponders he also researched the psychology of serial killers to help get him beneath the surface of the character his in depth performance preparation pays off beautifully br br while the actors writer and director do wonders with their material the real honor goes to the film's behind the scenes talent the director of photography paul production designer tom costume designer april napier special effects coordinator clay and visual effects supervisor kevin tod they bring the world of the cell to life it's is an extraordinary world worthy of several viewings some movies you watch others you experience the cell falls into the later category br br
<START> i made it about halfway through this movie and at that point realized that i absolutely didn't care how it ended it is basically a bland teen comedy that i only watched because i like helen mirren who is in fact very good as an impossibly cruel teacher br br the basic idea of the movie or let's say the first half of the movie since i don't know or care how the second half goes has been done before most notably in 9 to 5 and a comparison between the two shows how thoroughly tingle gets it wrong you need to feel things are spiraling out of control in a way that makes you feel events are inevitable and you need well defined interesting characters who you care about and you don't have that not the worst movie i've ever seen but it never grabbed me for a second
<START> i love meatballs terrific characters and poignant situations make this one dearly loved bill murray is hysterical and you gotta love that 4 mile trail race at the end a total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years it brings back fond memories of camp and deals nicely with the experience of being rejected by foolish peers and the empowerment brought one by being rescued by a sympathetic adult tons of great one liners and quite an assortment of wacko counselors this is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases among friends for years afterward also nothing overtly crude and what a sweet late '70's soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia i can't say enough about meatballs it's a classic be forewarned all the sequels are putrid stink bombs that simply bought the name rights for marketing they have no connection to ivan masterpiece
<START> it's the best film that takes the first place at the sickest and an useful films ever made in this poor country really u people even don't know what the word cinema means and u cast votes for movies i'm really curious to know how many movies of p p p or l bunuel have u seen the score of this experiment it reflects a lot of way of understanding things and to recognize a good quality movie when u see it we the romanian people have only one movie and until this day the status hasn't change that movie is but i don't lose my time thinking how many of you have seen it that is a movie that respects all the required of an movie from the script to the frames and even to the quality clarity of the picture even are past over him 41 years i recommend to the voters to search for better movies and then vote kudos will see u later
