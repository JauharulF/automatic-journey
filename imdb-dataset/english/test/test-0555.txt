<START> this movie really sucked hard it was just stupid with a terrible ending i love a really cheesy horror flick but this was terrible the trick ending totally contradicts everything you've seen in the movie if you last til the end take my advice and steer clear of that dirty old hag the granny
<START> so many films are now in a genre described as comedy thriller as was this one a fine cast interesting premise but what an unpleasant film to watch into films then either saving grace or lock stock are far more enjoyable films rating just 2 out of 10 roach clips
<START> from the opening drum hit of we're gonna groove to the last guitar hit of whole lotta love this two dvd set might be one of the best music dvd's ever to hit the shelves since the beatles anthology was finally released earlier this year br br one of the best things about this dvd is that on disc 1 a whole concert and many television appearances can be found for instance the whole royal albert hall concert is on the dvd as well as some of the best performances from the band's last concert at br br in the royal albert hall concert for instance the band had a lot of room to improvise jimmy page's guitar solos make dazed and confused a huge rock power ballad as opposed to the laid back blues song it was on led zeppelin i br br next on dvd 2 is a promotional video for the led zeppelin iii hit song immigrant song one of zeppelin's hardest rocking songs the video is about as sketchy as a pre mtv video was but it displays a lot of guitar power by jimmy page as it was taken from a live performance after the video ends we are treated in transition with a short picture of fans filling the seats at madison square garden the following are performances that were supposed to be part of the song remains the same but did not make the cut excellent riffs like those in the songs black dog and the ocean were both present br br after the madison performances we are treated with earl's court most of the led zeppelin iv material was played here like the most popular song that zeppelin ever recorded stairway to heaven it is brilliant as always even more so than the version on iv br br finally to end the 5 hours of live material is led zeppelin's final concert in in august of 1979 as the viewer watches this they have to admit that robert plant's voice is getting and deeper from all of the screaming he has done in the past and it is evident here on songs like kashmir and in the evening plant does not have his vocal boost of old yet on whole lotta love it returns for one more song br br overall one of the best musical dvd's ever released only next to the great beatles anthology boxed set that was released earlier in 2003 the sound both in 5 1 dts and 5 1 dolby digital just like the beatles dvd gives you a feeling of being on stage with the performers standing right next to them as you would feel on the beatles dvd when they are jamming in the studio even though the beatles and led zeppelin are different bands though they each received different dvd's even though this set comes on only two discs compared to the five disc beatles set it still feels very filling to the viewer after they have gone through all of that content it is also a pleasure to watch again and again not only because of the sound quality but because of the sheer energy on stage when robert plant begins to sing br br a brilliant effort from atlantic
<START> the kid power hour featured two segments hero high and let's start with hero high br br hero high was intended to be a new cartoon featuring their superhero identities the powerful archie captain hero jughead betty and reggie however filmation couldn't get the rights to do it so they tweaked it a bit and came up with this here's the breakdown of characters captain california archie glorious gal betty weatherman jughead dirty trixie veronica rex ruthless reggie principal samson mr and miss grimm miss the show featured live action sketches as well as cartoon adventures the humor was the typical lame filmation jokes but at least it had a sense of fun about it it was entertaining enough for kids though not quite up to previous standards br br the other segment was which was very faithful to the comics unlike the previous live action show all of the major villains made appearances as well as the entire marvel family including freckles marvel in at least one episode uncle dudley had the correct wc fields voice and shady character as well as his perpetually acting up burr middleton a veteran of 70's tv shows like fish voiced the big red cheese while alan oppenheimer rudy wells in the early 6 million dollar man episodes and voice of skeletor in he man handled dr br br the marvels had always had a sense of whimsy to them so little alteration was required for their adventures to meet the broadcast standards and practices requirements the censors as such the stories were very imaginative and inventive amongst the villains who appeared were dr black adam mr atom mr mind aunt minerva and the crocodile creatures mr tawny also made his on screen debut br br hero high is due to be released from bci but is still in limbo as well as the live action show hopefully the proposed movie will help shake them loose on dvd it is well worth watching and deserving of dvd treatment
<START> last night i got bored and decided to watch a movie called 'out which i had once bought with a whole lot of other cheap movies from a videostore seemed like a good old action movie so i took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening well the pain started right from the beginning the main character is a boxer who is the nicest guy i have ever seen as the good person he has to be nice of course but he is just a pussy that totally doesn't fit with a boxer that has 28 and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra money even nice guys can still be cool well then came his first fight while he was working for this pimp every punch was clearly missed and that became even more annoying because the sound effect weren't synchronised with the punches then there is this totally worthless acting of the whole cast and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is i gave it a 1 because i have never seen such a bad movie
<START> this is the best 3 d experience disney has at their this is certainly better than their original 1960's acid trip film that was in it's place is leagues better than honey i shrunk the audience and far more fun barely squeaks by the 3 d movie at disney mgm and can even beat the original 3 d movie experience captain eo this film relives some of disney's greatest musical hits from aladdin the little mermaid and others and brought a smile to my face throughout the entire show this is a totally kid friendly movie too unlike honey and has more effects than the spectacular
<START> if there is such a thing as beautiful horror this film is one of the best in this genre it is a horror movie which despite not being void of gore scenes relies more on psychology and masterful building of the tension in order to create thrills and it is one of those movies so beautifully filmed where each scene is a full world of symbols and details all serving the scope and genre that it can be called but beautiful br br it is not an easy story with two sisters returning to their father and step mother mansion after having spent some time in a psychiatric institution they cope hardly with the death of their mother and they try to protect a world of theirs defending them against the adult world so the film seems to be at its most external layer actually the film slowly evolves to something very different at slow pace but no frame is lost to convey the sense of thrilling beauty so i will not say much more watch it it is one of the best in the genre of far east horror films that conquered recently the world cinema and it really shows that they succeeded to do it for good reasons
<START> this movie should be called blame it on the script directed by stanley donen of singin' in the rain fame this celluloid mid life crisis is not all bad it's got some lush scenes of rio de janeiro and various scantily clad extras cavorting with each other and romping around the beach to the sultry sounds of samba but there is just something about watching fifty something michael caine get it on with whiny teenager michelle johnson that makes you feel well sleazy this storyline is a complete stretch too nobody but pervy and vain old studio execs in hollywood could have green lit this embarrassment maybe they are so used to having young bimbos as arm candy that they forget it's their fat wallets that hold the key to their appeal not their huge larry king style spectacles and yellow cigar stained teeth it's one thing for a nubile young sexpot to have a crush on an older man but on her best friend's father who happens to be married and then to throw herself at him shamelessly ugh there's nothing entertaining about that it's rather pathetic and grotesque take note of a young demi moore's budding cough talent
<START> the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted it is a tale that exemplifies the american spirit and the american character this movie is a story from the early 20th century that is strangely relevant to the political landscape of the world in the beginning of the 21st century it is a true classic
<START> this is a powerful film which seems to have never re arisen after the joe mccarthy censorship period it influenced me as a jewish teen ager who had friends of various colors and whose father's family had suffered under the fascist regimes in europe during the second quarter of the twentieth century unlike the later rip off on the waterfront which seemed to take some of the same themes and twist them to fit the enforced hollywood political correctness of the time it told its story direct and with respect for the characters and for the reality it reflected it was an antidote to gone with the wind birth of a nation triumph of the will and so many other of hatred and violence i would place it alongside the recent german film also virtually hidden in the us rosenstrasse br br i remember that the tv version also black and white in format as well as story was blacked out by some stations because the black hero's wife appeared white as a young civil rights worker it produced a conflict for me because on the one hand i was opposed to smoking cigarettes and on the other opposed the boycott in georgia of a sponsor of the tv show a major tobacco company i no longer remember which one does anyone else br br i would love to find a cd of either the film or the tv show to let my sons see something that informed my opposition to racism universally as opposed to only fighting racism against jews and recognition of the inherent connection between racism and
<START> porn legend gregory dark directs this cheesy horror flick that has glen jacobs kane from wwf wwe whatever it calls itself nowadays in his cinematic debut he plays jacob a blind serial killer who's forte is taking people's eyes out the plot be it as it may has a group of troubled youths cleaning up the historical hotel that resides in and subsequently being offed by him hemmingway it's not starts of as fun dopey b movie but soon gets too tedious to be enjoyable glad i went in with pretty low expectations but even those weren't met how can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from a lack of nudity for shame br br my grade d br br eye candy samantha noble bares her ass briefly
<START> has arguably become one of the best tv series to come out of turkey with its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken personally i do not agree with singers becoming actors hence deniz the lead actor but i guess the figures speak for themselves br br in relation to the movie it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline years in the making this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series not only that the cultural mistakes were unacceptable with an idiotic scene involving the family members dancing greek style and breaking plates which does not exists anywhere within the turkish culture br br some argue the movie should be taken as a stand alone movie not as a continuation of the tv series but this theory has one major fall the way the movie was marketed was that it will be picking up where the series left off and will conclude the series once and for all so with that note in mind me and everyone i know would have asked for a refund and accepted to stand outside the theatre to warn other victims
<START> basically a road movie the gay transsexual and other gender bender themes are rather disturbing particularly when the child is involved you do have to hand it to the costume designers as for the actors the only one i was familiar with was terence stamp i suppose it was a very good performance out of his or anyone's normal range the movie as a whole was shallow just a vehicle for the clever bitchy banter all in all i recommend this one
<START> owen loves his only he'd love her better six feet under in this dark laugh out loud comedy that both stars and is directed by danny devito with admirable assists from billy crystal and anne ramsey in the title role br br throw momma from the train is a terrific comedy even if it isn't a great film it's too shallow in parts and the ending feels less organic than tacked on but it's a gut splitting ride most of the way with crystal and devito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer devito is avid but untalented crystal is blocked and bitter br br crystal's professor donner believes his ex wife stole his book the unfortunately titled hot fire and can't write more than the opening line of his next book which doesn't come easy he teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities including a middle aged woman who writes tom clancy type fiction but doesn't know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through and an salesman who wants to write the story of his life mr is probably the funniest character for laughs per minutes on screen an wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus 100 girls i'd like to pork br br then there's devito's owen lift who calls himself professor donner's star pupil even though the teacher won't read his work in class owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie a man child in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother anne ramsey who calls him and other endearing sentiments in any other movie we'd be asked to feel sorry for owen but throw momma from the train piles life's cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along that's one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people br br for those of us who enjoy the humor of this character even identifying with him and take the rest of what we see here as a lark it's not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes asking us to watch in amusement while owen enlists professor donner's help in a plan to kill his mother actually he first goes to hawaii to kill donner's hated ex then tells the professor it's his turn to kill mrs lift swapping murders as seen in hitchcock's strangers on a train br br as a director devito not only complements his actors' performances with scene setting that places the accent on dialogue he makes some bold visual statements throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes and away from taking things too seriously br br also helping matters is writer stu silver who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter you got rats the size of here she's not a woman she's the terminator one little murder and i'm jack the ripper those are all crystal's words but some of the funniest lines which work only in context but absolutely kill are devito's and ramsey's apparently silver never wrote another screenplay after this according to the imdb and that's a shame because he had real talent for it br br the best scene in this movie when crystal meets ramsey was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical 'coming presentation the only time i've seen a movie promoted that way owen introduces the professor to his mother as 'cousin patty ' and when momma says he doesn't have a cousin patty panicky owen loses it 'you lied to me ' he yells out slamming the professor's forehead with a pan br br of course in reality the professor wouldn't groan out something witty from the floor but 'throw momma from the train' works effectively at such moments when playing its looney tunes vibe for all its worth devito hasn't disappeared from films of course but it's a mystery why he hasn't really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie maybe it's because as 'throw momma from the train's lack of mainstream success shows his kind of vision isn't to everyone's tastes that's too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over and like it
