<START> the hebrew hammer is a clever idea wasted as the execution is weak as if often the case with iconoclastic humor it relies overly on outrage to generate laughs which simply isn't enough poor taste humor has two elements poor taste and humor and both are needed here but the humor is pretty scarce as a result it is often painful to watch all the more so because of good attempts on the part of the performers particularly adam goldberg as the himself the shaft references are funny though but only to those who know those movies and they certainly don't carry the hebrew hammer br br another problem is that many of the jokes rely on knowledge of american jewish culture and many in the audience will simply not understand the jokes
<START> i would like to know who conned the producers of this movie to pay for its production that is a genius of sorts this movie somehow held my attention for about two thirds of it until i realized that it was going nowhere fast i think the music managed to make it seem like something was going on but nothing really was it was not scary the dialog was poorly written the first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes this would have been a moderately acceptable twilight zone or outer limits episode br br at this point i'm just mad that i wasted all that time that's a couple hours that i will never get back br br i hope these comments save someone from wasting their evening take a nap or hit the gym instead or if you want to be scared turn on a cable news channel
<START> a pretentious but to varying degrees watchable collection of mostly pointless stories br br but let's start from the top br br if one ever wondered what finnish love romance was like perhaps this dull little oddity is some indication subdued feelings non emotions apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from finland to siberia i guess the sequel to this story will be for our honeymoon we move from siberia to greenland aki obviously had no clue what to write for this little movie so he just made up some half assed non story centering around a band he particularly likes or maybe they're his friends because we get to watch them and listen to their music more than the two principal characters br br first off i've never heard of this guy before Â and now i know why nice black white photography and pretty much nothing else unless being bored silly can be considered an asset but you'd be surprised how many movie critics and film students love boredom in movies so i hotly recommend 10 minute snooze fest to those two groups of humanoids br br herzog not a movie but probably a slice out of his documentaries about tribes in south america this isn't a short film but a report but considering how dull the first two entries were herzog's bit is almost refreshing and does have some interesting moments and if nothing else fits into the movie's pretentious time concept very neatly br br jarmusch as was to be almost expected this once interesting film maker with the brain of a peanut a talented idiot savant serves us yet another doze of pointlessness he has become lazy and can't be bothered to write anything interesting either for his own movies or a collection such as the only bright side in watching how a dumb veggie actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the lovely chloe sevigny otherwise skip this nonsense oh and btw i don't believe that any young actress listens to classical music was jarmusch trying to be surreal by making chloe listen to that kind of music does lindsey lohan perhaps listen to opera maybe drew barrymore is a jazz fan who am i to say they aren't br br jim jarmusch is a moron oh right i already mentioned that br br wenders here is the actual shock of the whole movie wenders can actually make something good everything else i've seen from this overrated charlatan has so far been dull and pointless however this short little story is done with style Â atypical and is the best part of the movie it leaves one wanting to see more of it even though the story has a resolution br br spike lee oh dear what can i say here lee makes anyone seem talented by comparison like herzog he chooses not a story but submits a report Â and a left wing political propaganda report at that cnn but in black and white and one sided of course naturally we robbed the retarded title of this little sleep is about how the poor gullible and infinitely idealistic democrats robbed by bush and his evil evil team of thieves this is by far the dumbest and dullest entry in this movie and i had to utilize the fast forward button so as not to doze off spike lee truly is a product of affirmative action god knows how many really talented black directors never had a chance to make movies because this pretentious and talentless little runt keeps getting opportunity after opportunity to make them and he gets it wrong every time now that does take some kind of talent right br br kaige the chinese story has a solid premise it's okay nothing more br br all in all there are many and far better movies to spend your time on but if your time isn't that valuable as is apparently the case with my own you can check this little film out br br ten minutes sure can be an eternity in the hands of anti masters of cinema time is precious waste it on better movies
<START> this movie really starts strong we know that roberts is an atlanta hotshot sent to australia to fix marketing problems we also know he is an eccentric genius roberts' fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly br br unfortunately the plot is so flimsy that whatever fine character development has been achieved it is by voids inconsistencies and downright boring film sequences br br usually i am a sucker for bold and far out plots examples which i am fond of include dark star o c stiggs and popeye coupled with the fact that i must admit that this film was well acted it surprises even myself that i cannot recommend this film br br the utter breakdown in this movie occurs about midway through the film all comedy is instantly lost and the film turns dark afterwards the film plods along the film's attempt to get the comedy rolling again is not successful more surprises await the viewer and they are darker still br br to be sure mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success however with this movie the result is about as successful as new coke
<START> i wanted to watch this to get a inside look at the show it told the story more of robin williams then mork mindy still thought it was great we got to see robin always being 'on' no matter what the performance of was awesome br br the introductions of the main players seem so real to me roebuck as garry marshall was wonderful he was so charming in this which helped me get through all the williams energy the little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows happy days and laverne shirley was enlightening i also thought richmond peck's harvey was also a nice rock in the pond this is a good thing br br this movie told the age old story of hollywood folks going through the ups and downs of stardom it kept me glued to my tv and i learned to love robin well hell mostly everybody seem to be the super people i sometimes think hollywood is go figure br br i sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots we never saw the head of abc just heard him like charlie from charlie angels i wonder if this way planed it seems so sad that a show at number 1 could be so destroy by their own network br br i think this story could be told about anyone's life as they climb the ladder of any job movie and tv stars are always loved or hated by so many people that you grew up with you just want to reach back in their past to remember your own past i remember watching the show and always wondering what does happen in their personal lives br br mork and mindy will always be part of me and i got to see part of them it may not all be the truth it's also all not a lie but in the end it told me a wonderful sad happy story
<START> like all of the very earliest films this movie is very very short lasting about one minute so because of its brevity it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films but for its time it's actually a very remarkable film much of this is because the prints were hand painted making annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance i've actually seen two different versions one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout i think the red one depicted on the dvd the great train robbery and other primary works is the best of them the dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art and unlike other one minute or less films of the day this one is one i could see repeatedly it's just that visually compelling and odd br br if you want to see it online there is a 36 second version on google video type in serpentine dance
<START> this was laurel and hardy's last silent film for roach studios however since the public had a real thirst for talkies this same short was re made by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes laughing gravy was essentially the same plot except that stan and ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord not a goat like in angora love this whole goat angle is the worst part of the film while you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog after all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless according to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of it away and kept it huh this just doesn't make any sense if it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure laurel and hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians this film features quite a few laughs but unfortunately isn't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers this aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper
<START> reading the other user comments the review by has articulated most of what i was feeling throughout this film predictable storyline clichÃ© versions of lesbians heterosexuals i e straight woman becomes a lesbian while concluding that her husband is abusive and aggressive br br also the score was severely disappointing it was bland soft sentimental elevator music another common clichÃ© in movies about lesbians the movie would have had a few interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by the music br br a few scenes concerning sex and eroticism also struck me as attempts to titillate and raise shock value including parts of the final performance scene the conventional hot and steamy moments were as boring as the overly sentimental score for example during the pool scene the women are kissing and then the camera pans along the abandoned wine glass the flowing water the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft crashing of waves br br the only elements i liked were the costuming and they are well choreographed and the development of attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the training scenes i genuinely smiled during those and during the last scene with the police officer but they were not enough to balance out the negatives or make me enjoy this film
<START> seriously i don't get why people are all like oh my god step up is the best movie ever it's a bunch of junk the acting first of all is ridiculous and let's not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible movies are supposed to be entertaining and this let me be the first to say was not entertainment i was actually laughing because i was so embarrassed watching it the music and dancing didn't do anything for me as well and what's with the channing tatum hotness that all the girls talk about whatever the movie was pathetic don't waste your time or your money unless you're a dancing movie freak but movies like that are not movies they're jokes
<START> the one of the best films of all times and everybody must realize this movie i m a turkish boy and a big cinema fun and in this days our cinema industry is up and is the best turkish film of last ten years and maybe one of the best films of all times director bilge is quite amazing telling story characters atmosphere is wonderful he is a minimalist director and tells about routine event family dreams expects life tells about you tells about me tells about us i promise you will find a piece of your body in this movie cinema life welcomes a new director he is waiting to realize i promise yo you will love this movie please watch it
<START> love jones cleverly portrays young african american men and women in a clear positive realistic sense i feel that all of the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job at capturing the mood long and larenz tate worked well together and i hope to see more work from the two of them as a matter of fact all of the actors actresses did such a fine job it would be great to see another romantic comedy from them this movie can be compared to most any well written romantic comedy if you have not seen this movie already i strongly recommend that you do it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love
<START> i've liked milos forman's movies since i saw one flew over the cuckoo's nest and amadeus two big masterpieces but when i saw hair i kept wondering if this was the same milos forman this movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least ok the music is pretty good but on screen it only seems like a bunch of drugged people dancing around wait a minute that's what it really is in fact the only interesting part and the only part where talent shows up are the last 15 minutes or so spoiler since when berger takes claude's place as a soldier set to the vietnam war that 15 minutes are moving and well directed but it's a shame that we have to endure so much awful material before that br br well maybe this is one of those movies you need to be on the subject to enjoy the subject being marijuana acid and other drugs the film glorifies i'm not so
<START> well this movie wasn't as horrible as i thought it would be i was expecting to give it one star i chose to give it three why well for a cheesy horror sci fi movie it's not all that bad sure the characters are tacky as is their acting including a young leonardo dicaprio the effects cheap looking and the monsters well let's just say that i've seen some more effective halloween costumes in elementary schools but there was something about this movie that made me watch it till the end a little bit of humor helped out a bit i guess and if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas this movie will let you live your dream 3 10
<START> this was truly horrible bad acting bad writing bad effects bad scripting bad camera shots bad filming bad characters bad music bad editing bad casting bad storyline bad well you get the idea it was just just what's the word oh yeah bad
<START> fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still to come greatness kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video he considered it embarrassing and amateurish and he was correct in his evaluation this is a weak and tedious film at 68 minutes it still seems longer than barry lyndon it nevertheless is of historical interest and has its genuine absorbing moments it's a difficult film to find only unofficial copies are in circulation though perhaps this may change if kubrick's estate relents and has it released on video recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts
