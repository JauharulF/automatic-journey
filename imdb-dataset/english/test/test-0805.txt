<START> i cant see how some people cant find this film funny i saw the end of it on sky movies in 2001 thought i would by the dvd since then i have laughed my balls of with lines like laugh and hello night porter when they never get any phone calls overall i think this film is very very funny
<START> the only reason i rated this film as 2 is because channing beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch usually i adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time i didn't shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasn't acted very well at all i'm no film critic but i just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you're watching it is to see channing tatum lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasn't in it not that his acting was any good i would have stopped watching much quicker it's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear jerker if you're looking for a good cry or a film for a girly night in give this one a miss
<START> odious chuck norris decided to put one final nail in the coffin br br containing his film career before going to the safe world of cbs br br saturday night carnage with this hysterically bad supernatural br br actioner br br for such a dumb movie this thing sure is plotty norris is chicago br br cop frank shatter first off what kind of last name is shatter br br have you ever met any shatters com has no listing for br br the last name shatter which opens up any half clever viewer to br br replace the a in shatter with an i he and his partner calvin br br jackson do the same old buddy cop routine you have seen br br before make funny with the pimps and make their captain mad br br jackson looking like the theoretical love child of whoopi goldberg br br and rick james quickly wears on the nerves with his constant br br complaining and eddie murphy patented facial expressions br br shatter and calvin become involved with an emissary of satan br br whom we are introduced to in the too long opening scenes br br is a demon who is locked in a crypt by king richard the br br the demon's scepter from which he gets his power br br is busted into nine pieces and hid in nine different parts of the br br world by holy men in 1951 some grave robbers accidentally let br br out and he begins collecting the nine pieces he br br disguises himself as an antiquities professor named lockley and br br always happens to be giving a lecture where a holy man is killed br br and a piece of the scepter is taken br br norris brings in his walker texas blunder cohort wilson br br who plays assistant she helps norris with his br br investigation they make goo goo eyes at each other and our br br intrepid investigators travel to israel after a rabbi is killed in br br chicago while in israel calvin is given even more to complain br br about the heat the lack of restaurant the lousy br br drivers and the fact that he is missing the chicago bulls br br games norris even manages to work a cute israeli kid into this br br nightmare steals calvin's wallet and hangs around the men br br leading them around israel and not arousing any sort of br br appropriate suspicion br br eventually lockley assembles all of the scepter br br pieces but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremony br br and call up the devil where to find royal blood well br br father is a duke she has an american accent but she is the br br convenient method of forcing this monstrosity br br toward its inevitable conclusion sure this minion of satan may br br have killed countless hundreds over the years but how is he br br gonna do against a good old fashioned american butt kickin' br br after has been vanquished killed by his own scepter i br br envied him he did not have to watch steal calvin's wallet br br again we are treated to an awful coda involving a bearded man br br who has been watching shutter i mean shatter and calvin on br br their quest you see it was foretold somewhere that two br br warriors from the west would defeat the silent br br bearded man who watched over the couple was none other than br br jesus i kid you not he is listed as prophet in the end credits br br but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle christian br br reference the film makers are trying to exhibit here br br like in i use a walker texas ranger norris is aging and cannot br br get into his fight scenes too much anymore he kicks a lot and br br people fly over furniture in slow motion and then norris gives all of br br his line readings in that monotone voice of his oh what a real br br director might be able to fashion out of him his brother aaron br br who has directed him in other films as well has no sense of story br br or momentum scenes are thrown in for sake not to br br entertain the scenes when the dynamic duo first meet drag br br on and on and then is not all that important to the rest of the br br film br br the film was shot on location in israel which means the br br americans could insult the israelis in person there is not one br br likeable israeli character here the israeli police captain is a jerk br br the cops' driver does not know english and calvin convinces him br br that the word sh tty is a compliment nothing funnier than br br mocking those stupid foreigners on their home turf especially br br when all this racist humor is coming from an american minority br br who would have been more than offended if the tables were turned br br and the israeli cop was mocking the african american cop in br br chicago br br this film is badly written badly acted and badly directed it does br br not work as action cop drama or even horror it just shows that br br the now defunct cannon studios was willing to throw their money br br into anything no matter how badly it was planned hellbound is br br surely a most adequate title i disliked this movie intensely br br this is rated r for physical violence gun violence strong br br profanity some sexual references and some adult situations br br
<START> shuttle is was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way i ever could imagine this movie has lost its story if you can call it a story after half an hour all the next scenes are totally out of proportion the driver is some kind of superman because he survives every attack with gun knife etc even after stabbed in his leg he was able to put her in the box but what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage i really felt sick and misled when the movie ended it could have been such a great one if the story was far more better in my opinion even a kid would make a better story and why shipping the girl with water and food i quit with counting the plot holes about halfway through and when the movie reached its almost admirably sick over the top final twist i had completely given up better say throw up the worst thing about shuttle is actually that it can not be even more worse that worse maybe writer director anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time think the better he'll move to a different genre i keep my fingers crossed but from now on i will read the comment on his future movies first before looking a waste of time
<START> four friends is one of those films that you go to without any expectations only to find yourself knocked for a loop you sort of file it away but then you hear the song georgia on my mind by ray charles and images and vague feelings begin to flicker on the edge of your consciousness and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry almost at the same time br br why is this film so memorable first at least for people who lived through it all because it captures so well the tenor of the times its dashed hopes its successes its sincerity and above all the emotional roller coaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia and then the acting is just so amazing all angst and passion georgia as difficult to grasp as a will 'o the wisp but enchanting nevertheless and louis the handicapped room mate with charm to spare who attacks life with gusto and takes each moment with a wry smile because he knows only too well that it just might be his last br br how long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story even if they were far from perfect the film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable but the film never it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety even the minor characters have a well defined personality and a history which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top because that's the way life is when you think about it and why this film engages you with a complexity that is defined by character truly an amazing and satisfying experience
<START> that's what i kept asking myself during the many fights screaming matches swearing and general mayhem that permeate the 84 minutes the comparisons also stand up when you think of the one dimensional characters who have so little depth that it is virtually impossible to care what happens to them they are just badly written cyphers for the director to hang his multicultural beliefs on a topic that has been done much better in other dramas both on tv and the cinema br br i must confess i'm not really one for spotting bad performances during a film but it must be said that as the heroine's slutty best friend and wasim as the nasty bullying brother were absolutely terrible i don't know what acting school they graduated from but if i was them i'd apply for a full refund post haste only in the lead role manages to impress in a cast of so called british talent that we'll probably never hear from again at least that's the hope next time hire a different scout br br another intriguing thought is the hideously fashionable soundtrack featuring the likes of snow patrol ian brown and keane now i'm a bit of a music fan and i'm familiar with most of these artists output but i didn't recognise any of the tracks during this movie apart from the omnipresent run b sides anyone we get many many musical montages which telegraph how we're suppose to feel these are accompanied by such startlingly original images as couples kissing by a swollen lake and canoodling in doorways this is a problem as none of the songs convey the mood efficiently and we realise the director lacks the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue alone br br the ending is presumably meant to be just desserts as everybody gets their comeuppance and there is at least one big shock in store but i remained resolutely unmoved because the script had given me no one to root for it's not enough to tackle a hot button issue you have to actually give us a plot that hasn't already been done to death and individuals who are more than window dressing as it stands this film is a noble failure with only the promising lead actress and a few mildly diverting punch ups to save it from the bin 4 10 must try harder
<START> this is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on this movie is practically navy for the 90s or police academy at sea proves he can play roles other than frasier as he outwits and the navy in order to get his own sub rob schneider is as wormy as usual the same in every role he plays and lauren holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain ken hudson campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase the movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non predictable script that still surprises me every time i watch it many of the navy phrases and terms go over my head though but it's a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters
<START> two college buddies one an uptight nerd the other a rude slob embark on a road trip through the country on the way they encounter a vicious vehicle that looks like an army tank combined with a monster truck that tries to run their car over they escape it but only enrage the mysterious and dangerous driver more when one of them takes a leak in the top hatch while at a rest stop later on they pick up a sexy hitchhiker who ends up getting involved in their life threatening situation monster man is an extremely entertaining horror comedy that has some good suspenseful moments as well as some good gory ones the two lead characters and their constant bickering is fun to watch all on its own and the end takes a tcm like turn which was very well done absolutely worth checking out
<START> this film is a benchmark in non mainstream cinema history the use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of strike eisenstein's 1st film take the scene on the steps and note the repeated shot of the soldiers descending to reiterate the point of the horrors that actually did happen a highly intelligent monumental film a must see for all film students
<START> it was funny because the whole thing was so unrealistic i mean come on like a pop star would just show up at a public high school and fall in love with the girl who happens to be obsessed with him come on people br br everyone but the lead girl were completely horrendous at acting the dialog was cheesy the premise was stupid and the camera work was poorly done i felt like i was watching a badly made home video br br i feel as if i've wasted almost 2 hours of my life that i will never get back br br i don't have anything else to say except that i'd rather punch myself in the face multiple times than watch this movie again
<START> what a travesty of movie ratings injustice a 2 1 on the imdb scale as i write this folks this is a lot closer to a 3 0 i'll even go out on a limb and say 4 0 where i've put it come on how can you have a movie about a net of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien cell structures and not give it at least a 4 0 for creativity then you've got all that great dialog like dave look at the composition of this mud you know i don't think they ever got back to that mud no matter this is the kind of flick that 'z' movie diehards live for and i can now rest easy actually i saw this quite a few years ago without the proper appreciation for it along with corman titles like attack of the giant leeches and the wasp woman i don't know what the fascination might be but to quote a character from the film whatever it is it works fast br br back to that alien cell structure i liked the idea of a third element competing against your standard red and white blood cells when astronaut john corcoran michael returned from the dead i had visions of a scene that might have been a precursor to 1979's alien but that was not to be instead budget restrictions limit the picture to a de feathered big bird knock off even though that concept was still almost a decade away who knows where one idea leaves off and picks up with another br br look this is not that bad not that good but not that bad anytime you can hook up crash landing astronauts with alien beings committed to taking over the earth you've got a winning combination throw in the cheesy monster factor and you're on your way just remember a wounded animal that large isn't good
<START> makes invasion usa look like apocalypse now this one can only be recommended to us skinheads john birch supporters or militia members the message is very simple let's shoot them all gooks commies latinos everything that isn't american br br besides this is badly acted badly scripted badly interpreted incredibly stupid but no fun at all this movie could be used as a device by cia torturers oops sorry there can't be any us torturers because they are the good
<START> the greatest movie ever br br how's that for a contention however if we look at it through purely cinematic terms it is clear that three colours red is a masterpiece it is not enough to merely say this three colours red is the masterpiece of world cinema if you accept that citizen kane is not human enough if you accept that star wars is not actually very good if you accept that ozu and both have to take a step back then three colours red is the foremost masterpiece of all time as a discussion into human morality three colours red works on an intensely metaphysical level with a depth that none can match blue went almost as far into the human psyche but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat white forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality this in retrospect was better still but still not quite there red however is the real thing what he expresses in this movie is an expression of what it is to be human in fact what he expresses is how it is to feel human it forces us to examine up to the minutest detail the very nature of our souls of our ethical selves in red one may find meaning on one of its several levels on the first level red achieves a high level of verisimilitude we could have no trouble in calling red an exceptionally entertaining story however the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie it is as if kieslowski is saying pas la in effect in pursuing a humanistic goal kieslowski can also challenge reality it is a trick that kieslowski has been attempting since le double vie de but not until this his final film did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate philosophy and circumstance the actors and actresses too appear to be at the mercy of a greater power valentine irÃ¨ne jacob is aptly name for she seems to represent an almost pure love meanwhile the idea of first impressions is challenged by jean louis judge kern a cantankerous man who by the end becomes an almost all knowing observer of events a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together a power to make people happy a power which he could only achieve through valentine br br we have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures in fact films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature it won't happen of course but at least we have the power to view this film knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can't define but all possess a synopsis of this film read a film about a woman who runs over a dog well it is br br isn't it br br simon br br
<START> what makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies not kidding i was watching it already 10 times or so and did not get tired is it the tender melancholia throughout the whole thing is it the similarity to classics like niagara i was thinking a long time about that and figured it out i guess it is there is no hero there are only people some try to be good some gave up trying to be good some are hopeless cases but carry still the spunk of being human inside it is the story of a catastrophic night in a motel at the end of the world one way the catastrophe is nothing but the end of a chain of coincidences the other way this night reveals the logical of this peoples lives because they are in a certain constellation cut off the rest of the world it has something of a tale
<START> czech cinematography is traveling through dark times this movie is a tangible evidence obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictive people characteristic of their stupidity a young and healthy boy who doesn't want to work and prefer to live in a decaying shack with a feckless alcoholic aunt because of the idiocy of who's just able to announce dad i'll not work in the factory i'd really like to know why i understand the condition of his house but i'm really not able to digest the horrible mess around cramped sentimentality everywhere why didn't monika escort her boy to work abroad young czech couples do it very often and take someone else's children to live in a devastated barn that's too much br br irresponsible mother badly acted by naive stupid boy silly and confused girl monika yes somebody has already told it badly directed and acted soap opera actors like martin tatiana and did their best but unfortunately it couldn't save the whole piece
