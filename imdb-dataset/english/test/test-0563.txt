<START> though predictable and contrived not a bad movie it entertains which is all van damme hopes to do the omnipresent twin device is again used as in a large number of van damme's movies but it is not bothersome except to long time fans natasha is gorgeous and worth watching action is decent nothing spectacular for van damme but exciting i can recommend to van damme fans and even to those who aren't but don't mind an action film with a good looking lead couple the russian mob is a nice concept and topical for the day clearly not his best film but by no means his worst
<START> i already gave my comment on this movie under the name now under i want to add something now after a long time i have seen a lot of so called heroic bloodshed titles but not many come close to the action shown in john woo movies that's why after all these years i think it is strange that china white doesn't get the credit it deserves no matter what version you have seen the action is top notch the scenery china town in amsterdam is very unique you get the impression it is a large district but having lived in amsterdam myself i know it is only a small area part of the red light district which happen to have a lot of chinese stores and restaurants but because of the way they shot the movie it actually looks like a big and important territory where people know not to mess with the triads chinese mafia besides the action china white is a compelling gangster drama with some good acting for this i have to give credit to russel wong too bad we don't see much of him lately since he has a lot of potential must see movie
<START> rififi is a terrific heist movie and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since jules dassin had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live you will not find here the hollywood glamour of ocean's eleven the robbers in rififi don't rob for the thrill and they're not playing a game they rob to survive to pay for their children's upbringing to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world the much lauded heist scene is a nail biter filmed in virtual silence i did have the feeling that the plot went on a bit longer than it needed to but the high speed race to deliver the child to his mother that ends the film is classic br br be warned this movie is very bleak but it's also very good br br grade a
<START> the plot' of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through but i reckon that isn't always top priority in horror two elderly sisters in rural england keep their brother in the cellar since more than 30 years now he escaped and started a killing spree focusing on militaries that are nearby we only did we thought was best for him' they keep on repeating and Â strangely Â all the army officers love these women and don't doubt their sincerity even though 5 of their men died i don't know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful Â or tedious in a way this film reminded me about arsenic and old in that black comedy classic two half insane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well yet they do the killing there the old ladies in the beast in the are by no means less crazy though the horror' in this early 70's film is very amateurish and cheap but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension too many old ladies' talk about the good ol' days though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title flora robson who may be recognized by classic film buffs plays one of the sisters she gave image to the queen of england is the legendary errol flynn swashbuckler film the sea hawk
<START> many of us who went through high school probably made it through alright without having to take a physics course i know i didn't but after watching this program i surely wish i had br br this documentary is a guide to the 'holy grail of the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into one 'master that eluded einstein during the last years of his life brian green a professor at columbia university introduces us to this mind blowing theory in a wonderfully simple way and leaves us with an even greater appreciation for the universe we live in br br we start with the tantalizing possibility of a 'master that could unite and explain everything everything in this universe including the four fundamental forces that we know that exist the strong nuclear force the weak nuclear force and gravity green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with the work of newton then einstein and then later on to the revolution of the physics at the quantum level br br but it is at this point that we run into a problem that has plagued physicists for years and one that no one has been able to solve just yet how can we unify all these forces that we know together we find as green constantly points out throughout the problem that the answer to this perplexing problem could be in the theory of strings however if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory there is a very big price to pay br br it turns out that out of the mind numbing mathematical equations of string theory that as a consequence we find that we could possibly be living in a universe filled with not just 3 dimensions that you and i see every day plus 1 for time but rather that we may actually live in a universe of 11 dimensions but the math that arises out of that theory doesn't stop there the possibility exists that there may actually be parallel universes some of them right next to you and me could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously as green points out we have yet to fully find out but we do know that the math that has arisen from these equations are already showing us that the universe still has much to show us br br for those of you who fear that you won't be able to understand the concepts in this program fear not professor green does a wonderful job of doing away with the math and harder concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the concept which when you take away all the math from it transforms from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and as green constantly points out concept viewers of this program need no prior background in science the concepts are so simple even a child could understand them br br when you finish this program you will truly come to understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe it is that we live in
<START> did you ever think like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends wow this is so cool we have got to make a splatter horror movie ourselves some day soon i bet it isn't as difficult as it seems well this must have been what went through the minds of the young campbell brothers back in 2003 presumably right after watching sam raimi's the evil dead or a similar independent horror classic this demon summer however is so bad it's embarrassing these young amateurish filmmakers obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics but that nearly doesn't make them talented i've seen quite a lot lousy b movies in my years as a horror fanatic but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made and it's quite sad to be this open hearted because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions there's pretty much no script at all a duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and whilst reading some passages of it one of them mutates into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenager groups dorks hot catholic girls stoners and troublemakers that's about it except of course for all the obligatory clichÃ©s like the hot girl falling for the biggest dork etc etc the performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry they just stand there motionless until the script says it's their turn to interact i hate that some of make up effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punk songs ever this film should never have been released i can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production but it's utterly imbecile and doesn't feature the slightest redeeming element not even a bit of amateur nudity damned
<START> after reading the reviews i decided to rent the dvd version br br i like classical music and wanted to learn more about bach br br i was disappointed i guess i do not know enough about bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played br br maybe it would be appropriate with the guidance of an expert in bach's music that can explain the film br br i really tried and saw the whole film hopping that i would be able to enjoy at least some of it but i did not br br see it at your own risk
<START> i know that full moon or any other film studio for that matter could never recapture the fun and cheesy sci fi feeling that was the original trancers ' and with the last two entries in the series having jack deth in medieval times instead of futuristic los angeles it became quite obvious that there really was little hope in reviving the trancers series breathing new life into a film is one thing but taking our main character out of his element and putting him into the past well it didn't work so now with trancers 6 full moon has breathed so much new life into the series that we don't even deal with jack deth any more we now deal with his daughter jo jack is in her body and must go into the past and fight the trancers one more time br br minor spoiler first scene of the film revealed br br to prove how bad this movie is you only need watch the first two minutes of the film when the original jack deth appears on the screen but it's not actually tim thomerson it's clips of him and sound bytes strung together trust me you can tell they're strung together horribly to provide the viewer the last of the true jack deth humor and from this point on things only go down hill having this girl jo deth as our main character while jack deth is supposed to be in her body is the worst idea in the world having this cute young woman act as a rough and tough man isn't the right track at all it doesn't work and it really comes off as foolish br br i'm not going to go into the aspects of special effects and makeup because most reading this know what full moon has become a really really low budget enterprise i don't know what to say about this movie except i really wish full moon could be like it was in the days of demonic toys puppet master and trancers 1 back then while the special effects weren't great the story telling was they made serious b movies for serious b movie and horror fans and that just doesn't take place today with the new full moon studios i yearn for the good ol' days and truly hope that full moon can pull itself out of this horrible slump that they're in right now br br trancers 6 gets a 2 out of 10

<START> there are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer two women progressively find themselves ensnared in each other's arms as corny as the expression sounds that is exactly what happens and fins that they cannot answer their own question as to what defines their relationship when their very own society has no name to what they are deepa mehta's somewhat mis titled fire is the first of a loosely connected trilogy here linked by the theme of the elements and more symbolic than consuming fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not make an appearance here since the women the older and more feminine radha shabana azmi and the younger more masculine tempered sita nandita das come to realize they share a lot more than common ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families as in water fire is deeply spiritual even if it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama where water much like the weight of the word carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition even so it's a very beautiful picture and a strong voice from a strong director

<START> tragic hero is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic godfather films focusing on family crime loyalty and revenge also this is part of a two part series as the godfather also was at the time however this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other triad thrillers being released in hong kong at the time br br one reason is the acting with the exception of chow yun fat the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable the audience tends to find the proceedings humorous simply because the actors' inability to maintain any degree of seriousness as a result we find the film not truly emotionally involving or intense since we don't particularly care what occurs with these characters br br another reason is its lack of focus the narrative tries to incorporate many different story elements into the film but this results in portions of the movie becoming underdeveloped as well as lacking any real sense of coherency the audience sometimes becomes lost at the proceedings we are viewing not knowing what the character's motivations are br br the film's climax does contain a decent gun fight but again since we don't care about the characters we don't care who lives or who dies the scene loses it's intensity and suspense because of this the other action set pieces are rather mundane in nature with a feeling of it being too controlled rather than free flowing br br in general this is a strictly average film and isn't recommended to the general film viewer only hard core genre enthusiasts and fans of chow yun fat should consider this film for viewing
<START> even an old cynical doctor who fan like myself can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favourite show it happened previously during eccleston's finale and it happened watching this episode it doesn't happen often though but the impossible planet is an example of both the show and of television at its very very best this is stunning television br br the doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience many of who will be moving behind the sofa are instantly transfixed a door opens and horrible monsters start stalking the time travellers this might have taken up an entire 25 minute episode in the original show but all this takes place in he pre title sequence you may miss the longer drawn out format of the original show but at least this new series is tightly plotted and if we're treated to a disappointing story then at least it's usually only for one week br br there is nothing to disappointment a viewer here it is doctor who at its most traditional best writer matt jones and director james strong have gone out of their way to make a story that will be regarded for years to come they do this by constructing a doom laden narrative the doctor and rose lose the tardis and they're stuck with the protagonists in the far flung future it's interesting how many stories never feature this type of plot point where the doctor and his companions no longer have access to the tardis which makes for a more intriguing type of story without doubt the highlight is the scene where goes to look for toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and beckons her outside everything from acting make up and murray gold's music makes this a scene that genuinely shocks its audience br br i can imagine immediately after this episode the bbc received a tsunami of complaints for distressed parents saying how traumatised their children were that it took them several hours to get them from behind the family sofa and that they're now refusing to sleep with the lights out to do this complaining would be to deny the magic of doctor who yes it can terrify and yes such images will burn themselves in to the mind of a child something they will never forget even if hey live to be a hundred but i will bet my life that these same traumatised children would have spent the week begging that no matter what they'll be allowed to watch the next episode
