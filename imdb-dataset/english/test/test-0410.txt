<START> this film did not excite me while on vacation in turkey i noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it the action sequences in the film are well choreographed however the story drags during the middle of the film br br one thing that i did not quite follow is how was able to get the money to bribe the guards br br the other thing that i did not particularly like was the missing segment of khan's life it did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re imprison him after he had gone missing for so long br br overall i rate this movie a 4 because i enjoyed the action sequences but they were too few to justify a higher rating as the dialog left me less than impressed
<START> if you like subtle psychological dramas thrillers this is a movie for you those who want to see an ordinary erotic thriller surely will not understand this movie as colin firth obviously did when he called it rubbish but jennifer rubin is the real star of the movie anyway she is such a brilliant and beautiful actress along with the twisting and turning storyline that gets more and more psychological and makes you think about yourself the wonderful directing photography and especially the music make this movie a masterpiece also the small parts are very good especially belinda is terrific in her small scene i hope it gets released on dvd soon and a soundtrack album would be a dream coming true
<START> basically an endearingly chintzy and moronic 1 50 version of the nifty early 80's subterranean creature feature favorite the boogens this entertainingly schlocky cheapie centers on a nasty squirmy wriggling monster who makes an instant meal out of any unfortunate souls foolhardy enough to go poking around the notoriously off limits gold spike mine your standard issue motley assortment of intrepid boneheads hard nosed mine boss cute but insipid blonde babe feisty lady geologist boozy inexplicably aussie accented seasoned old mine hand charmless doofus hunky jolly guy and arguably the most annoying character of the uniformly irritating bunch a nerdy bespectacled aspiring writer dweeb who's prone to speaking in flowery melodramatic utterances trek into the dark uninviting cave in search of gold naturally these intensely insufferable imbeciles discover that the allegedly abandoned mine is the home of a deadly ugly multi tentacled beast who in time honored hoary b flick fashion proceeds to gruesomely bag the group one at a time directed co written co produced and co edited with dumbfounding by melanie anne phillips acted with dismaying flatness by a rank no name cast further marred by lethargic pacing a meandering narrative murky under lit eye straining cinematography a shivery redundantly thudding pseudo john carpenter synthesizer score and a cruddy herky jerky stop motion animation thingie that's only quickly glimpsed at the very end of the movie this extremely clunky amateurish and hence quite delectably dreadful would be scarefest commits all the necessary bad film missteps to qualify as a real four star
<START> well i have to admit that this movie brought some occasional laughs to my face ok but that does not make it a good movie most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing not all of them give great acting performances but some really try but fail because their characters are badly written the perfect example is julia she changes her eating habits from one talk to the other on one talk she does not drink alcohol on the next she is allergic to champagne she feels too beautiful for most people in fact she is but still ends up with the perfect fit concerning the looks and refuses to give some more realistic guys a chance and so on the end is very cheesy although i like one of the final scenes when everybody finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughters mostly because it is about sex and relationships i assume and maybe some short entertainment still the whole picture is one big stereotype and nothing is really special about it
<START> this is a superb film and was immediately put in my top ten trust me i know films it's one of the movies that really makes you think not necessarily about the storyline but about yourself the film is about a fifteen year old kid leland fitzgerald who kills an autistic boy he is sent to juvenile hall where he meets pearl madison his teacher his relationship with pearl slowly grows and eventually pearl decides to write a story on leland and his peers but as he gets closer to finding out motive he learns he must deal with his own issues first br br this is a great film and a must see with great music by the pixies and a fantastic score watch it
<START> trekkies is really not a movie about star trek fandom it's a freak show about those star trek fans who have no sense of reality as a freak show it's fine but it is a mistake to think that this movie gives you an insight into star trek fans most star trek fans cringe at what this movie shows
<START> all right let me start by saying i love the original rs for the 64 the graphics were new the ships were really fast and cool the missions were a challenge but you had a strategy to come up with the computer didn't tell you every step of your mission you could wander and explore br br that's the first thing that's wrong with rl everything you do is under a timetable and controlled by other people i mean shouldn't you as the leader be telling people how to handle each and every mission br br and speaking of missions why do they intersperse the original trilogy with completely made up crap never mind br br i was so waiting for this game when i heard they were going to allow you fly through the asteroid field from empire strikes back i think anyone who is a fan of the films wanted to do this so they give it to you it's the stupidest level in the game you start by flying through the asteroid field with ties chasing after you and your whole objective is to get farther into the field while shooting the ties you have to kill them all to get ahead hey remember how many han killed when he was in the field none they all had poor piloting skills compared to him i just wanted to be able to dodge the asteroids as they came at me but instead i have to use my automatic aim guns to kill ties behind me br br that was the biggest disappointment you have no control over your flying everything is sluggish all except for the a wing probably the fastest and most ship in the entire fleet but oh yeah didn't han say the falcon was anyway br br you finally get to the battle of endor here is the ultimate level you get to destroy the death star everyone's first instinct is to pick the falcon and be the leader but of course you get there and have to do stupid pre chosen strategies like finding not to mention deciphering the difference between the tie bombers this is impossible in the falcon by the time you have spotted one group the gets destroyed the only way to get passed this part is to pick the a wing after this you have to attack the star destroyers and that's a real stupid chore this game makes you feel like you're the only one defending the rebel alliance br br after you frustratingly get through that 'fun' fight you get to the death star and here you might think i get to destroy the death star' and again like in the asteroid field you have to do some tedious thing while narrowly getting passed the tunnels of impending doom your mission is to protect the ship in front of you remember that from the return of the jedi it's so moronic because if you pick the falcon you'll die because you're not enough but if you pick the x wing you have to keep locking and unlocking your s foils so it's a choice to either kill the bad guys or try to catch up to lando who apparently doesn't know how to maneuver thus dying in the process br br the bonus stages aren't even worth aiming for as each level just gets more and more frustrating it makes me feel the way i did when i saw the new three films upset and in need of killing something lucky for me smash bros melee exists br br i hope with the wii they come up with something a lot better and have the original trilogy levels to full capacity i'm going to sell this game the first chance i get
<START> in 1965 producer kevin who owns a part of the bond cinematic rights associate with eon productions harry and albert broccoli for making thunderball the fourth film of the 007 franchise the star is sean connery of course br br in 1982 wins a legal battle and can produce an independent bond film never say never again is one of the two unofficial 007 films made outside eon the other is the 1967 comedy spoof casino royale is a remake of thunderball and stars the original bond sean connery who comes back to the role after many years of absence br br the film is released some months after octopussy with roger moore the 13th episode of the eon series at the time press calls it war of the bonds both films are a big success in 1983 even if octopussy earns more money at the box office br br is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians director irvin kershner who led the empire strikes back douglas cinematographer of raiders of the lost ark and screenwriter lorenzo semple jr who wrote the three days of the condor among others br br the cast is excellent with connery a then relatively unknown kim basinger barbara carrera klaus maria brandauer max von sydow edward fox br br although all that the film remains inferior to the original thunderball it lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real bond movie there's not the traditional gun barrel sequence there's not the james bond theme m and q are not played by the traditional actors it's a copyright reason eon only is allowed to use these elements briefly lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere br br on the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable brandauer is a very good villain and the women basinger and carrera are sensual and gorgeous but the main highlight is sean connery he's once again wonderful in the role he's older but looks fitter and nicer here than in diamonds are forever his last performance in the role of the british super spy before
<START> first of all nothing will ever compare to the original movie but for gosh sakes they're not trying to it is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after rhett left scarlett at tara i for one thought it was a terrific movie and would like to add it to my gwtw collection the scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie just view this movie as an extension of the original and don't think they are trying to replace vivian leigh and clark cable and you will enjoy it a lot they really captured the spoiled selfishness of scarlett in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the looks from rhett that he is clearly still in love with scarlett the fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on tv i always wanted them to have other children after bonnie blue died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly br br
<START> this movie was an embarrassment thurman looked like she had some kind of disease and john travolta looked like he was walking in his sleep i was expecting this to be a so so sequel to get shorty not a half baked remake of the exact same movie except that some of the character's have different names and clothes br br i would not recommend this to movie to my worst enemy i feel like i was ripped off and hollywood has once again tricked me into seeing another horrible sequel i also suffered through alien vs predator br br the best thing that i can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of 2005
<START> to start with i have done some further research on the film jules dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film secondly this was a very low budget film created in the rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir thirdly the where the robbery was attempted is an actual the producers of rififi asked them to film their surprisingly i quote jules dassin in a recent interview on the subject surprisingly for some not very obvious reason they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop br br it's impeccable characters and plot fit in so beautifully with their surroundings to add on to my praise i will say this some might say that this was a typical hollywood film on the contrary this set the base for the regular plot of a hollywood crime film br br i would like to say that i support this fresh idea of a film where not only one side wins and that side doesn't always have to be the good one for once i can say that a film is not predictable ten stars
<START> one of the most unfairly maligned programmes of all time was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the '70's and '80's br br it started life as 'happy ever but when eric merriman decided he didn't want to write any more it changed into this hence the dropping of 'aunt and the fletcher's becoming the br br yes it was cosy domestic middle class stuff the plots ran the gamut of clichÃ©s from the boss coming to dinner the vicar organising a jumble sale and unwanted relatives coming to stay for the weekend it was certainly not lazy comedy' as for it being 'not it was not meant to be it was funny and well performed and that was enough br br i too loved the boom of the '80's 'black adder' 'the young ones' etc but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this if nothing else it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to i found it sad though when the likes of ben elton took against both this and benny hill well family oriented comedy has all but vanished from our screens but where has it left us take a look at the latest t v schedules all soaps and reality dross the few comedies left are aimed at teenagers meaning they are jam packed with swearing bodily function jokes and explicit sexual references and they are not remotely funny either br br the comedy' boom was good in many ways but had a dark side it made conventional sitcoms appear old fashioned drove away talented writers and performers such as spike milligan and ultimately led to such unspeakable drivel as 'little britain' and heaven help us if it ain't broke don't fix it
<START> when you're used to lana turner in the postman always rings twice and compare it to this low budget low talent low quality film well i was just embarrassed for ida lupino's more like talking and non piano playing scenes when the first non singing scene started and all the people just stared flatly at her i was positive they were all going to roll their eyes and start leaving or at least talking among themselves she stinks c'mon let's get out of here the actors are flat emotions are deflated and ida is a real spoiled bi throughout just a 100 turnoff this was like betty boop on conscious sedation meets a gas station attendant in ville usa the story was flat the music was flat the acting was flat her chest was no never mind i felt sad for the rest of the actors perhaps if the right actress was to have been given the lead role and the men actors had more emotion then the film could have had a chance sorry for offending those of you who thought it was out of this world i wouldn't have minded if it stayed out of this world
<START> low budget mostly no name actors this is what a campy horror flick is supposed to be all about these are the types of movies that kept me on the edge of my seat as a kid staying up too late to watch cable if you liked the 80's horror scene this is the movie for you
<START> i have this movie on a collection of inexpensive b movies it's not restored in fact the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes br br at first it seemed like a typical haunted house film and feels very much like the forerunner of clue murder by death house on haunted hill etc br br about a half hour into the film the storyline takes a really interesting twist and it goes from being a clichÃ© melodrama to something entirely different and far more entertaining than i had initially thought br br check it out it's a great deal of fun even if the long clips and wider shots and near lack of music score make it feel a bit creaky by today's standards
