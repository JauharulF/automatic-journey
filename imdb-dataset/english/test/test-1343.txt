<START> pink flamingos was revolutionary for its time and even today it's still hard to watch not that i didn't enjoy the film it's hilarious but it's very repulsive and jonh waters pushes the envelope as far as it can go the story concerns babs johnson devine she's the filthiest women alive she lives in a trailer with her son crackers and daughter cotton not to mention the overweight edie who's obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a crib then there's connie and raymond marble two filthy perverts who are jealous of babs they long to outdo her in being the filthiest person alive this means having their janitor impregnate kidnapped women and selling the babies to lesbian couples flashing people in public and even sending babs a turd in the mail babs fights back to prove she's the most deranged person alive which even includes incest murder and eating dog crap and other sick sexual acts it's a film that's fun for the whole family well depending on where you live watch pink flamingos but don't forget your barf bag for more perverse weird sex and bodily functions also see sweet movie
<START> why can't a movie be rated a zero or even a negative number some movies such as plan nine from outer space are so bad they're fun to watch this is not one the dungeon of horror might be the worst movie i've ever seen some of anyway i had to fast forward through a lot of it fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age there may be worse movies i've seen but thankfully i can't remember them the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint the special effects looked like a fifth grader's c set in a shoebox the movie contained unforgivable such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant he then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it without the gun having been reloaded this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits i guess no company or studio wanted to be though i guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn't needed this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible as the manipulator the worst movie i have ever seen with an actual one time hollywood leading man mickey rooney the only time i would recommend watching the dungeon of harrow or the manipulator for that matter would be if someone were to pay you i'm kind of cheap i'd have to have 7 or 8 bucks for dungeon and at least ten for manipulator phil the never out of the can cinematographer
<START> watched this flick on saturday afternoon cable man did it drag i got the metaphors symbolism and all that stuff no i didn't care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters but the pacing of the story and the scripting almost put me to sleep br br that is until ruth marshall got naked if you're a breast man who is not homo phobic you may want to rent it ruth has a lesbian sex scene that's pretty hot and then a hetero sex scene that is a notch higher than most standard movie fare her jiggly d cups made the film worth the watch br br the mighty avatar
<START> being advertised as the most expensive movie ever made in the czech republic it automatically makes the you think it will be over glorified and clichÃ©d out of fear of the budget however with a budget of 8 million and half the movie in english it was not exactly a big budget high risk movie br br what we have a grand epic tale centered around the friendship of two people the younger karel and the older frantisek as pilots in the czech air force when the germans invade before the beginning of world war ii they escape the country to england to joined the raf br br their friendship becomes strained through the love of the same woman however there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond merely being friendly their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the czech people and their country remember they were not the winners the defeated the germans only to be invaded by the russians br br funny exciting intriguing beautiful sad and illuminating this movie is one of my favourite war movies most of all i like the way they make fun of the british in a way that is amazingly affectionate and gives an amazing insight into the way the british military fought wwii br br forget the recent american efforts peal harbour saving private ryan this is the best wwii movie for a long time
<START> everyone's favorite trio of bumbling imbeciles run amok in a hospital in this incredibly raucous and often hysterically funny romp these guys are without a doubt the single most incompetent bunch of doctors to ever fumble their way across the screen comic highlights include the stooges constantly breaking a glass pane in a door their encounter with a deranged patient who claims that rats used to come out of the of his shirt the stooges riding through the hallways on a giant bicycle a huge horse and miniature race cars and our sublimely stupid threesome accidentally leaving instruments inside a hapless patient's abdomen after they finish operating on the poor fellow director ray mccarey relates the frantic comic shenanigans at an appropriately nonstop hectic pace and stages the broad slapstick gags with considerable gusto moe howard larry fine and curly howard are all in peak loopy form with sterling support from dell henderson as long suffering hospital supervisor dr graves squeaky voiced jeanie roberts as a hiccuping nurse the scene where the stooges do an absurd impromptu group with this gal is absolutely sidesplitting ruth as a whispering nurse billy gilbert as the ranting crazy patient and little billy rhodes as a feisty tiny patient the spirited lunacy never lets up for a minute thereby making this beautifully berserk baby one of the stooges' best ever outings
<START> when i watched this movie when i was a kid i didn't understand the premise of hitchcock movies and dark comedy now that i'm in my mid 20's it makes a lot more sense br br i think the reason i like this movie so much is that the comedy duo of billy crystal and danny devito make for some interesting comedy both slapstick the frying pan and car scenes and verbal the arguments conversations over murder and writing br br the story revolves around larry donner crystal a struggling writer who has his masterpiece stolen from him by his wife margaret played by a surprisingly radiant kate mulgrew aka capt janeway from star trek voyager br br while he shifts between writer's block and teaching creative writing class he meets with student owen lifts devito an aspiring writer and overgrown mama's boy who sadly still acts like a kid he has toy train tracks need i say more think of failure to launch only matt mcconaughey is short fat and bald br br owen is stuck in his own life with a demanding evil mother anne ramsey who he can't stand he seeks larry's advice on how to get out of it and when he says to go see a hitchcock film owen gets the wrong idea that if he kills larry's wife he'll return the favor and kill his mom for him hilarity ensues while the two try to deal with each other's problem owen goes to extremes to kill margaret while larry who refuses to agree to do his part of the plan is driven nuts by owen's mother br br throughout the film larry and owen slowly but surely form a bond of friendship that is rare in dark comedy nowadays one part of the movie i really loved was where owen shows larry his coin collection and lets just say its more a sentimental collection than anything br br the two main stars aside the late anne ramsey is hilarious as mama and deadly with that cane of hers she's a lot more comedic verbally and physically in this as opposed to her role as mama fratelli from the goonies so she curses like a sailor and belittles her son at every turn but thats what makes her character so vivid she makes her character the kind of person you love to hate br br another treat in this movie is the music of jazz great marsalis who plays larry's neighbor and friend lester there is a great moment in the movie where he plays jazz for larry who is depressed and needs some good tunes to relieve the pain jazz can do that br br in closing i wish billy crystal and danny devito would do another good movie together but their kinda getting too old for the game i'm sad to say this is one of those rare movies where both stars shine in their own subtle ways devito's childish comedy and crystal's sharp wit made this movie for me 5 star comedy
<START> yeah that's what the station disclaimer states after the commercials for this show some scenes may be disturbing to some viewers br br it is beyond disturbing the validation of this whole display of ego framing and chauvinism is in the fact it is on the comedy channel yes a comedy true and true a joke to see these go through their rigid charade really spells out what is wrong with society especially the meat market bar scene both sides the male and female are equally as weak and desperate to be among this superficial atmosphere the club is obviously one of those cigarette corporation sponsored plastic coke scenes these people do have a choice and that is what makes it even more of a joke br br these slick try too hard they glisten with their own groove grease that's ok it's a lesson on video tape for the new generation of how not to focus on a potential heart interest hopefully that facade will crumble along with the bush harper administrations problem is who's lined up after these characters fade the bastard children of the one night stands
<START> pulling in 2 6 million viewers one has to wonder what everyone's opinions on the storyline plot is br br reading the run down over at lifetime i was led to believe that this would be an edge of your seat thriller about a single mother being stalked and finally confronting the stalker sadly i was mistaken while the main plot is interesting enough single mother run off road one night then is stalked by same guy the reasoning behind the stalking left nothing but a really bad taste in my mouth br br laura leighton plays the victim and she does it well whether it was all those years on melrose place or not she does well in this movie playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from harm and she's looking pretty good too these days br br leighton is really the only good thing about this movie i think many people will identify with the main character after discovering why the stalker is stalking it will be a view only once type of movie
<START> i agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly i saw it on showtime late at night as a teenager and again in college i thought it was funny and there are boobs everywhere it seems like in the late 70s and 80s there were loads of this type of film made from r rated films like porkys to soft core au pair girls it's a shame they seem to have fallen by the wayside in terms of popularity the thing that made hots great was that like the previous two films it's a hell of a lot of fun hots is like a girl power version of animal house with the girls forming a sorority of sorts and engaging in campus bedlam on a side note whoever designed the hooters girls outfits must certainly have seen this film
<START> movie based on jacqueline best selling novel it's about robin stone john phillip law a ruthless tv anchorman who claws his way to the top it details his love life concentrating on amanda jodi wexler and judith dyan cannon it also shows his total inability to commit to anyone and instead sleeps with any woman he can get br br the novel is no work of art it's not even good literature but it's a quick silly trashy read but this movie makes it seem like gone with the wind this is a textbook example of how not to do a movie adaptation first they condense the novel terribly in the book stone's inability to commit is dealt with and it's revealed why here it's brought up and ignored also there's a truly revolting scene in which a woman is brutally beaten it's in the book but there is a reason totally left out of the movie and the book dealt with three women not two don't even get me started on the homophobia br br adaptation aside the acting is pretty terrible law is just horrendous as stone very wooden and boring you seriously wonder why all these women are after him to be fair to law another actor was cast but had a very bad accident before shooting began and law stepped in at the last minute wexler is terrible as amanda maureen arthur is truly astoundingly bad as ethel evans shecky greene is unbearable as christie lane only three performances stand out david hemmings having a great time camps it up as a gay photographer cannon is actually very good and robert ryan is just great also dionne warwick sings the catchy opening song he's moving on br br it is bad but i watched the whole thing and it is in a silly sort of way a lot of fun i'm giving it a 3 br br also jacqueline susann has a cameo as a newscaster
<START> a lot of alistair maclean's books have made it onto the big screen some of them the guns of fear is the key where eagles dare have been translated rather well some pass ice station zebra the secret ways have been passable enough a few river of death bear island the way to dusty death have been pretty rotten caravan to is another movie based on one of maclean's popular bestsellers but alas this is yet another that deserves adding to the rotten list peopled by uninteresting characters who get into uninteresting situations and escapades caravan to is an absolute failure both as a thriller and an entertainment its only semi redeeming qualities are a that it is filmed on very attractive provence locations and b charlotte rampling looks utterly ravishing with fully nude scenes to boot as the main female character br br disillusioned american drifter neil bowman david birney is travelling aimlessly through france when he meets british photographer lila charlotte rampling they decide to accompany each other and during their wanderings make the acquaintance of mysterious nobleman duc de michel the duc persuades the pair to aid him in protecting and escorting hungarian scientist michael bryant who is sought by various shady parties because of some information that he is carrying in his head kept secret from bowman and lila is the fact that has discovered a secret formula for using solar power as cheap economical energy the hungarian needs desperately to get his formula to new york but hired guns have been put on his trail to capture him Â presumably so that he can be taken back to some ruthless criminal lord and tortured into revealing his priceless secret which they can then sell on to the highest bidder bowman and lila find themselves and their terrified fugitive on the run in the french countryside from their deadly adversaries br br the film seems terribly cheap and amateurish almost like an ultra low budget independent film made by a non professional cast and crew yet a fair sum of money was actually thrown at the film and all those involved have at various points in their careers done much better work therefore one has to assume that the film is bad simply because it has been written acted and directed with a distinct lack of care and interest the pacing is deadly slow and the plot points become so laborious that the viewer has to put in too much effort to keep up with the story performance is uninvolving and rampling only creates a stir due to her nude scenes Â the character itself is an absolute bore and the actress looks rightly bored by it for those who manage to stick with the film right to the very end there is an unusual scene featuring some deadly rodeo clowns and a fierce bull which while not particularly exciting or well executed is at least different to the norm caravan to is a very disappointing film in most respects and once more a strong novel by the prolific author has suffered during its transition onto the screen
<START> my mom always told me to sit down and to actually watch this movie because it's one of her favorites i never did for years until i caught one night on tv this movie was great i don't even know how to explain it not only is the cast excellent julia roberts keifer sutherland kevin bacon william baldwin and oliver platt but the story is awesome it's freaky but not too scary and it makes you think i was left speechless after this film and amazed of how good of actors and actress all five of these people really are where did william baldwin go he's great this film is a must see for anyone if you haven't seen it go rent it you will not be sorry amazing
<START> ugh pretty awful br br linnea quigley gets top billing but her character doesn't have a big part who is her character supposed to be anyway the little boy's aunt another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene while there was a shower scene in the movie it was a head and shoulders shot perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie br br quigley does have a bigger part than john carradine cameron mitchell and brinke stevens though carradine shows up briefly in a robe reciting vague dialog no other characters are in the scene with him though he's sort of composited in or else there are over the shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else there's also a really bad photo of him in a cameo it looks like a bad and a decent picture of him in a family bible he conjured up jack o originally or something like that br br cameron mitchell briefly shows up on a tv as a tv horror host brinke stevens is in the movie he's showing the coven in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe evidently there's more of the brinke footage as a bonus feature on the retromedia dvd double feature mark of the witch the brides wore blood br br jack o what's it about darn if i know a little boy is told a story about a pumpkin headed demon killer and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason she follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for halloween put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes etc the pumpkin headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things and actually kills people br br there are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too ancestors of his i think i think they figure into jack backstory but i'm not sure how br br the little boy is ostensibly the main character but we don't really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses has nightmares and will fight bullies even if he'll get beat up in the process more time should have been spent establishing his character i couldn't have cared less if he died br br not recommended not even for halloween
<START> connery climbs aboard the moore buffoon train in this stinker of a movie tossing away everything that made bond successful in the first place this movie further degrades the bond character throwing him into the category of inspector gadget get smart this ain't there is no style here only second rate actors performing on cheap sets it's a shame that connery couldn't lend an element of class here but it doesn't come across everything here reeks of mediocrity including connery's bad toupee perhaps if i was snowed in and given the choice between watching never say never again and howard the duck i would choose the former if you want the real james bond pick up any ian flemming novel
<START> i mean come on now my countrymen have started to make westerns is it not enough that our cinema sucks already now you need to infect english language movies with polish acting and no sense whatsoever please stay away from this movie do not waste your eyes on it a 5 year old baby could make a movie that makes more sense i am from poland and i am ashamed this title might actually be watched by you please i am begging you do not watch this movie and if you do do not judge polish people and polish movies based on what you see there we had some good movies in our history and we had some bad ones but this one it is like nothing worse that i have seen in my entire life keep away
