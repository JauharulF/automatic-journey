<START> what this film has is its realism you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style however the problem is unless you re a big fan of the sport there s not a lot in downhill racer to grab your attention br br before anyone asks why i watched it i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but that s not really a good enough reason for watching
<START> i switched this on from cable on a whim and was treated to quite a surprise although very predictable this film turned out to be quite enjoyable no big stars but well directed and just plain fun with all the over hyped crap that is out there it is very nice to get an unexpected surprise now and then and this little film fits the bill nicely 9 10
<START> the world is going to miss john frankenheimer this was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second but don't let that dissuade you from seeking it out frankenheimer's direction is assured and he gets some compelling performances out of his cast br br someone else has already pointed them out but i also want to talk up james gregory and whit bissell in two key supporting roles both would work for frankenheimer again gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in the manchurian candidate and they do good work for him here br br if the whole thing seems too simple in the end that's merely because frankenheimer and writer robert chose to tell a simple story and they do it well keep a lookout for it turner classic movies just might show it again
<START> chris penn is hilarious as the all time stoner brother of jeff this movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all eddie van halen which went on to become songs on and unlawful carnal knowledge this movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong fast times was more depressing than funny abortions friends cheating on friends jerking off in bathrooms bad jobs and failing school someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life the film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits michelle in the liquor store or ben stein in his first role in the sunny's surplus store
<START> this movie is crappy beyond any limits it's incredible a very bad ripoff from jaws and other better shark movies a really bad one everything is really pathetic the story is purest crap actors are bad effects very cheap no creativity whatsoever it looks like some really children took jaws script and arranged it randomly then its parents took their 8 mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors the music is really inappropriate just some elevator music bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when children gets depressed again listens to very loud elevator music carlo maria the author should be so ashamed he should ask for his name to be erased from the titles the movie acts as perfect demonstration how crappy music will destroy any scene which is supposed to be thrilling there is one major difference to jaws though in the beginning of jaws there are comments about stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite well there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite when this does not work guys take an big load of dynamite and spent like 1 4 of movie by placing explosives in some sunken ship this is really original way to catch the fish i have to admit they use so much dynamite like they would try to kill a battleship i would guess bismarck class of battleship or to dig another panama channel this is just incredible i'm glad they did not try to use napalm flamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad bad approximately 2 m shark well there is mystic disappearing native indian who looks like german pensioner too in this mess this is not a movie this is a warning example how bad the movies may be as a warning it is useful but the public should be protected from this crap most of italian movies is bad but this this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word
<START> i was forced to read this sappy love story between a german 24 year old pow and a 12 year old jew that has political correctness written all over it its kind of like the movie spirit in which a horse wants to be free but those evil americans wont let it because they need it well i have good news the americans are evil in the german soldier and his summer book why horses where given to us by god and if the americans needed a horse the can darn well use it in the same sense the german had been trying to kill americans but this book movie makes it seem ok the casting is absolutely awful the girl is hispanic the mother is white the dad it from mostly white descent and the little sister is shirley the acting is pretty bad too the serious parts become comedy bad movie bad book but both have different endings don't read or see either one
<START> ok the box look interesting the opening have great music and its kinda original to that its all ok but when the movie start well its not my first movie i watched ghost lake and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here the story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student with specials effect that me laugh the blood look like a mix of red and white paint the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop all the movie is shot in day very great for a movie supposed to be horror and there like no gore 1 scene only and it look so home made and not credible and near no blood it can be considered a great thing considering the look of the blood show and 1 demon for the whole movie the story is going nowhere it give you the impression that it never start there so much useless scene done only to give the movie the average duration time when the demon search the guy in the dogs thing for about 4 minutes way too much slow mo things well lets just say this movie is a z series one and a very poor one all cool idea lost themselves and you get a cheesy movie it bored my all long and i'm not the guy who get bored very easily with horror movie man i even like house of the dead and alone in the dark from uwe boll and you probably know the name for being one of the worst director but here it look too much like some guys wanting to make a movie for fun plus for us french speaker tough i understand english i prefer to watch movie in my native language there the usual bad translation in normal movie you can barely see its not the actor speaking you have to check on lips etc here you just have to listen to it and you know it very cheesy
<START> in out is a comedy with a simple premise it admirably succeeds in the mission of being funny and entertaining br br the comedy in this film ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime physical comedy exists alongside dry humor with a nice veteran turn by bob newhart kevin kline is predictably in excellent form in this film alongside tom selleck not playing to his expected square jawed leading man type mr selleck plays his humor well and displays a nice sense of comedic timing the cast makes this film successful br br not all films with homosexual themes are made to advance some sort of sinister hidden hollywood liberal agenda in point of fact this film was simply made to entertain and if any part of this films makes the viewer think then it was a byproduct of the well acted work by a terrific cast of professionals frequently tongue in cheek i found myself laughing at the right moments a solid b
<START> korine's established himself by now as a talented and impressive image maker the promotional posters for mister lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions though there's one in particular i've yet to see in promo material that of a blue clad nun teasing a dog with a stick surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down the opening images of this film of michael jackson lookalike diego luna riding a small motorbike round a track is strangely compelling and beautiful roy mister lonely plays on the soundtrack and the images unfold in slow motion there's also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance without music though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him in the middle of a paris street splices in sound effects and jump cuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character's dance routine br br the first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant father werner herzog is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over and drop food into impoverished areas nearby in a scene that is both light hearted and affecting herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco as the exchange develops herzog draws out of the man a confession he has sinned and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place this scene short and sweet gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins the sinner is played by a non actor who was on set when and co were filming and his adulterous ways had given him in real life a lasting overwhelming guilt br br henceforth the film is hit and miss a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous muddled narrative whereas gummo and julien donkey boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks mister lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness a few scenes were cut from the film which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters due to continuity errors in costume a result no doubt due to the absence of a shooting script and korine's tendency for improvisation one deleted scene in particular in which denis lavant and 'madonna' morgan have sex would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film i won't spoil it but it's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration and as it is only half succeeds br br the two strands of the narrative unconnected literally are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning one compliments the other and vice versa it's something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation but there's not enough of the herzog scenes to merit their place in the film and so any connection between these two allegorically connected threads is inevitably strained and the inclusion is in retrospect tedious br br this is an ambitious step forward from julien donkey boy that suffers mostly at least in the lookalike segments from having far too many characters for the film's running length a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone as was originally planned br br with many of the imagery's self contained beauty and moments of real genuine connection with the soundtrack this feels like it'd be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition as an exploration of and the nature of impersonation it'd lose none of its power indeed for me it would perhaps be more impressive the loneliness attached to iconic such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them is well captured in images such as that wherein a gorgeous samantha morton seduces the camera with a seven year itch pose in the middle of a forest or when davis jr ' jason settles post dance rehearsal with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible tranquil lake br br as it is moments like these and all those where the titles of randomly chosen michael jackson songs crawl across the scene are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be br br for those who see it i lost all faith during the egg singing scene late on you'll know which scene i mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which has previously been hailed
<START> apparently the film has a harsh anti bush message if it does i didn't get it that's all it is it's boring and useless period br br it's too serious at times to be a comedy too slow to be a thriller not funny not gripping not exciting not film it's too everything to be the opposite and vise versa i was amazed at how bad a film could suck don't even think of watching it br br i have watched literally hundreds of films and never have i been so obliged to write a warning on imdb avoid at all costs you have been warned br br even the making of is painfully boring it's just people talking gibberish with loads of inside jokes infront of a camera sort of like a home movie there even is a part where a guy takes you on a tour of the food that was consumed on the set by the film crew still beats the movie i guess
<START> first this movie was made in 1978 so that tells you that the movie is going to be bad anyway but i am not saying that all old movies are bad second the special effects we're terrible for even that time finally the acting was so bad bozo the clown could have done it better it makes you wonder how people get the money to make movies this pathetic this movie sucks
<START> this movie has more goofs than any other movie i have seen in my life the special effects are damned terrible for instance near the end when the concorde is falling after the cargo door tears off the thing spins like a toy the special effects of airport 1970 are way better than this crap also the force of a concorde opening up at altitude and speed would essentially turn the thing inside out that is if it would even open at all but the movie has its good points mostly when it ends that's also cheesy e g the thing lands on a bank of loosely packed snow if it did that it would splinter into a million pieces overall 2 out of 10 instant flop great laugh flick
<START> the acting was very sub par you had costas acting like triple h's dumber forest ranger brother a scott mcmahon look alike as his who i guess your supposed to care about but there is no emotional involvement anywhere you have the stupid lesbian not that i have any thing against lesbians i don't just stupid ones who keep running around in a punisher like shirt and a grunge like hat who keeps asking if anyone saw her dead lover br br the villain could be scary and there is a morality tale somewhere about trying to fight age and death but it is lost in this movie costas hurst points out to the soon to be victims the way back into town while obviously there are city lights behind him br br also a mispronunciation of ed gein but pronounced it as a citizen of wisconsin we have had our share of monsters gein dahmer and mccarthy but if your going to use it pronounce it right br br god why do i watch all these terrible films oh yes i am a glutton for punishment and i watch these so you don't have to
<START> frank clint eastwood is being harassed by mitch leary john malkovich a bomber terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught in the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer john kramer tobin bell from the saw series through clever planning and influence frank is able to make the arrest of mendoza bell br br from thereafter its a series of cat and mouse chase malkovich is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile once again showing a different role in this film he astounds me with his ability to his characters with the next film br br i've watch malkovich play in con air as a menacing insanely smart cyrus in of mice and men as the tragically challenged bunny lover lenny to name a few he plays a very smart bomber terrorist who is very sane but is deluded into thinking he can elude his captures br br clint eastwood is no one special me he's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing he can really astound you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes the characters he plays are simplistic and one dimensional br br rene russo plays eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me with her supporting actually being a bigger role to me than eastwood's br br while this might seem like an action blockbuster it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation you have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the end along the way you'll be mesmerized by malkovich and eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse
<START> the reason why this movie sucks have these people even read a bible everything in the movie was about moses god was staying out of it that didn't happen god directed everything he told them where to go and what to do also the people wandered for 40 years after they arrived at and betrayed god again they didn't wander for 40 years then suddenly find it it was a punishment for their doubts maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a bible first they would say oh no we got it all wrong try again everything in this movie was about moses they made god look like a jerk who was messing with moses the whole time no no no no no god was their the whole time and he wanted the people to see he was taking care of them how dare they say otherwise not even close to the passage and moses was kept out because he was angry at the people and blatantly disobeyed god he sinned badly and was told he would not be allowed to enter for it when did moses run off and yell at god for everything in the bible never actually read your story before you make up whatever you think is a good idea also this whole god stayed out of it for the most part and made them do it themselves is not true god did everything for the people he provided for them in every way and god told them where to go he was there the whole time the whole we have to do it ourselves is true in some ways but back then thats not how it worked yes today he doesn't work directly for everyone to see but back then he actually killed people after the golden calf thing god worked directly with the people read the bible next time echo bridge or don't make another bible movie
