<START> i didn't have much high hopes for this one before seeing it the story yelled stereotype at me br br i mean come on it's so stupid the plot line about the innocent android that realizes that the people who created him are immoral then decides to change everything br br i had to see it three times the first two times i fell asleep because i was so incredibly bored by it it's very rare that movies bore me so much i fall asleep during them the third time i forced myself to watch it simply to be able to warn people about it br br i got the distinct impression that the people responsible for this mess had tried to take all the cool neat things from other scifi action movies and put them together to make a kick ass movie they took the android robot lots of action thin story stereotype characters and a big fight in the end and threw it together unfortunately the movie sucks the acting is so wooden you could build a house out of it the storyline plot is absolutely laughable the camerawork and editing is horrid the direction is non existent and to top it all off everything is so cliche and ridiculous that it just annoys the hell out of you br br i was left with the feeling that i could've spent the time watching this one doing something much more creative like trimming my fingernails or watching the grass grow
<START> a powerful real tv movie very subversive and therefore remaining almost un broadcasted almost thanx 2 arte in france after you've watched this manhunt all movies filmed with the same concept a documentary team following the events as they arrived seem so weak br br david
<START> this movie is a shameful result of what happens when br br a it is written directed and produced by an idiot and or b it was rushed in production to satiate the poker stu ungar craze br br the story from beginning is uneven spends too much time on childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales such as counting cards his blackjack escapades the roll of money as id he also leaves out mentions of other poker greats such as chip reese etc the movie is a complete mess from beginning to end br br if you want a more complete and accurate account read the book one of a kind if you thought the movie was good read the book and change your mind
<START> two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace the scenes of the corral in the town where ward bond and ben johnson negotiate prices and bond introduces the idea of them johnson and his partner played by harry carey jr leading the train to this valley are some of the best in the film as johnson a real cowboy a piece of wood while he banters with bond once on the trail they come upon joanne dru who maybe john ford saw in red river and offered her a much better part in this film in the morman train are a number of notable characters the are a group who are challenged along the way by a truly lowlife group of outlaws in their case the outlaws in the case of the people on the train and later a band of navajos whom they encounter and in the well written characters played by ben johnson and ward bond the film completely evades stereotypes while the camera seems to spend as much time giving the viewer the big picture of monument valley framing the train as it moves along with a few water crossings along the way in stunning black and white and then coming back to what's happening in this rolling community all to the accompaniment of the beautiful of the sons of the pioneers
<START> if a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands the world would be in grave danger i am a huge fan of b movies and i have seen my share of bad ones but there is not a letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified puke this movie even surpasses the so bad it's good phase and goes straight on to the so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it phase br br it is hard to say what is more disturbing 1 the fact that the people who wrote this thought their political satire i use the term very very very loosely was witty enough to film 2 they were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this garbage for obviously little or no money 3 that someone actually thought it would be a good idea to pick this crap up for distribution on a horror anthology dvd br br were i a weaker man i most likely would have jammed grapefruit spoons into my eyes and then blindly flung myself to my death in oncoming traffic after watching this as it stands though i live but i am forever scarred by the experience
<START> well i read the other comments didn't think it sounded any good but decided to tape it anyway perhaps not so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie because of course i would be noticing all the same weird things excessive use of fade to black a few weird camera angles and crosscutting dialog for different conversations with the same people taking place at different times but noticing all that i thought to myself well this would probably be really boring if it was all going chronologically the conversations aren't that exciting but kind of mandatory and the constant fading to black after really short scenes really makes it feel like the story is fast forwarding too the interesting part skipping the boring bits at the end of the movie it gets a bit exciting too will they survive br br so i actually liked this movie no not really the director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience from being bored while he is trying to introduce the characters but he is overdoing it it gets annoying and sometimes confusing this was apparently only the second movie he directed so maybe he will learn and make really good stuff in the future and if you're sitting there in the future reading this wondering if the now famous directors second movie is worth a watch well if he is good in the future sure watch this crap and wonder how he ever got to make a third one otherwise this movie isn't really worth watching unless you very interested in film making and want to see one way you can cut the mandatory boring introductory scenes into something watchable
<START> the case history of 'mulholland dr ' is known what should had been another excursion after 'twin into the rivaled field of tv series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot it was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film the result one of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of david lynch his earlier movies 'blue velvet' or 'wild at heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here br br 'mulholland dr ' is a puzzle where pieces are missing others obviously were taken from and 'lost highway' but it never seemed to be unfinished work in the internet i came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film i am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely all those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required imagine this scenario a little child is dissecting his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies is it because it wants to destroy his toy does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child transferring this to 'mulholland dr ' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it br br david lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that human desires dreams obsessions and fears all that what remains unspoken emotions that are often repressed 'mulholland dr ' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly laura elena naomi watts justin theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast while their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible br br when you claim the criterion of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece a modern masterpiece that manifest david lynch's status as one of the most important creative and courageous directors of the present like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance this will fade as soon as you find the individual key to lynch's world of films 'mulholland dr ' is more than just a sleeper Â it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema and besides the film is a pay off with hollywood in form and content which in that was hardly dared before
<START> tarzan the environmental awareness leader faces four who by most unorthodox means abduct animals to get them to zoos tarzan has a bland but sexy enough wife with an impeccable hairdo and a kid no one should fault tarzan for being grieved by the vicious actions of the hunters br br this gordon scott tarzan flick is one of the silliest completely and unnecessarily silly for one reason or another the team did not find anything charming to sustain the movie and so it's just some silly rubbish tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil because tarzan's environmental awareness brought him into open conflict with the evildoers the kid and the chimpanzee both belonging to tarzan are kidnapped by the malevolent so tarzan summons the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to release the kid and the tarzan leading the attack tarzan and the is silly unappealing quite uninteresting maybe as a kid i would have liked it now one has to be too viciously mean as those pathetic punished by ask a tarzan flick not to be silly this i concede but one is also truly entitled to ask these tarzan flicks however silly to have and to show some bit of a tiny bit of gusto some kick some excitement some fun now the gordon scott tarzan failure is too silly exactly in the sense of not having any gusto at all of lacking all excitement yes i liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake what beast watch the movie kiddos now here i just gave you one excuse to do so for one reason or another the villains look somewhat pathetic and elicit mercy rather than virtuous anger br br the books leave the impression that tarzan seemed quite bright in his own way and if finding a decent bodybuilder or another sportsman to look clever enough for the role might prove a too demanding next to impossible task gordon scott was anyway too far from meeting that ideal br br the wife chides tarzan for disliking books br br the script suggests tarzan was uneducated almost illiterate and adverse to learning but the book says otherwise and we know that tarzan studied much by himself using the books of his gone family before even meeting white people br br and i did not like that yell br br it's supposed dear kiddos to be a genuine wild yell not a missed
<START> i'm actually too drained to write this review bad movies always do that to me but i feel obligated as if it's my civic duty to warn anyone who might be considering purchasing or viewing this god awful mess of a picture please please just take my word this is one you'll want to stay away from it's so boring and dull so insipid and uninspired such a poor excuse to assemble any familiar talent burt reynolds wasted despite his best efforts ice t is barely in the film and when he does appear on screen his performance is so restrained and muted that it becomes crystal clear that the director perhaps intimidated by ice's intense stare didn't know what to do with him rob lowe as the title character has never displayed so little on screen charisma mario van peebles should be ashamed of himself his performance is in the saddest sense possible a joke surely satan himself signed mario's check for this film the plot is as weak half baked and annoying as all the music involved the utterly boring club song seems to continue on literally for the first third of the movie the film's look will prompt one to seriously wonder if the director of photography was also forced like one of the film's forgettable female characters to smoke crack from a pipe duct taped to his mouth and if you're looking at least for stylized shoot 'em up type violence you'll get none here this film i assure you i promise you has absolutely no redeeming qualities please i implore you avoid this flick don't put it in and get suckered into believing that its pace will pick up it'll get better and evolve into a decent denouement it won't it don't it can't it sucks now you have been warned and i can now go to bed it's 3am please forgive any resulting errors this admonition might contain knowing my conscience is clear because i've done my civic duty for my fellow man
<START> took a chance to see if perhaps a really good wwi film had slipped my notice this isn't it john phillip law and don stroud are both stiff in their acting and miscast for their roles the dialogue is dumb or non existent the flying sequences are okay but pretty repetitive compared to the terrific blue max this movie should never have been made watch george peppard james mason and andress in the and you get why that movie is one of the best war films ever made and this isn't recently released on dvd and brown is presented as some great 'lost classic' from the 70's i resold mine the day after i bought it don't waste your time or
<START> this was a get up and go horror movie with an intelligent cast and a director with great vision to really capture the mood of the story i highly recommend this movie
<START> i am not a fan of musicals but i am a huge fan of jean renoir and jean gabin i rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even expecting greatness from the classic director this movie is beautiful the shots are like oil paintings with motion something a lot of directors strive for but renoir masters i cannot express how much this movie transcends itself it's not really a musical it just has a couple of well placed musical numbers and a grand dancing finale but there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute joy when watching it br br i am a fan of foreign art films but i'm also a meathead who loves things like die hard and schwarzenegger movies i get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in la la land but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good 10 out of 10
<START> this one of the best and funniest comedy series i have ever seen all characters are brilliant br br mr david bamber is a very very irritated man irritated by everything and anyone br br he wants to do things and handle situations as best as he possibly can but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble not supported by his wife janet who only tries to get him deeper and deeper into the trouble he is getting himself into and really does not need the help at all br br all characters are played portrayed brilliantly just imagine sending your kid s to a school like this br br it is unbelievable that people do not like it maybe some don not get the many many plays on words that are featured many times per episode br br it is also unbelievable that there is still no dvd release of it there are only 2 series br br so please release it let it go so the fans can and will enjoy it br br try it you might just like it br br just some names words from the series man helmet hot bitch mount suzy travis fellatio and many many more
<START> i wouldn't be so sure to accept the dna tests as irrefutable evidence against anna anderson first read peter book on which this film is based anna anderson knew things that only the real grand duchess anastasia could possibly have known forensic evidence in anna's favor aside second compare the pictures of anastasia and anna anderson anyone can see that they are one and the same person third visit peter website url below where you can read detailed information about the dna tests as well as why franziska and anna anderson are not the same person scroll down to the link anna anastasia notes on franziska even relatives believed that their sister and anna anderson were not the same person br br i for one will always believe that anastasia and anna anderson were indeed the same person i will never be swayed to the contrary br br www com
<START> most critics have written devastating about that movie but i wanted it to see myself and unfortunately they are right the film had the greatest budget ever in russian movie history two international stars colorful mass scenes apparently shot quite close to the kremlin but in the end it appears to be a nice sweet nothing you would not believe that this director earlier has made masterpieces like and burnt by the sun the characters in the storyline are not convincing neither jane nor nor andrej only general worth being mentioned it remains on the surface all the time politically it is to me a glorification of the army and especially the russian one with values like honor and duty and having lived at least half a year in siberia my russia is much more than the one that is depicted in movie regarding burnt by the sun by the same director as a no question 10 points movie one of the best i ever seen in my entire life i was totally disappointed by that one sorry nevertheless unique talent in delivering amazingly beautiful pictures is still there
