<START> black dragons is a second feature wwii propaganda film popular at the time it's not as bad as some would have you believe br br a secret meeting hosted by the respected dr william saunders george is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names monsieur colomb bela lugosi shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered their bodies being placed on the steps of the japanese embassy in washington colomb is suspected federal agent dick martin clayton moore is assigned to the case and meets saunders niece alice saunders joan barclay who tries to assist him the reasons behind actions are not explained until the final reel until all is explained at the end the story is hard to comprehend br br lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies is actually quite good in this one he is not allowed to over act as much as he did and credit for this has to go to director william nigh lugosi's character through the shadows and is reminiscent of his dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes br br clayton moore a one dimensional actor at best would become tv's lone ranger in a few years joan barclay makes a good heroine br br although a little dated now black dragons is not a bad way to spend an hour

<START> i'm a fan of independent film dialogue driven character study pieces are where it's at for me some of the other posts are right wannabes isn't going to rival the godfather for best mob film ever on the other hand wannabes is a well written and well directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor actress my problem with one of the other reviews br br conor stands out as the only irishman in a cast of italians br br is a jewish last name and as such has a dark not a traditional one of an irishman he doesn't stand out at all rather delivers a great performance br br this didn't win many awards but it is deserving of a saturday night with a bowl of popcorn i found it for 7 bucks at blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least highly recommended
<START> i decided to watch this on fearnet on demand for free because i figured well nothing else looks enjoyable and it turned out to be quite a good little horror surprise the film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from the point of view of four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere after they decide to build a campfire in the woods they begin to tell their spooky stories and the movie transitions to the events in the stories br br the honeymoon a newlywed couple traveling cross country in an rv to las vegas is terrorized when they park in a wooded area by evil beings that hunt by the full moon i won't spoil that for you the hook amy smart and james marsden probably the most famous people in the movie besides beautiful christine taylor play the young couple who come face to face with the maniac that has a hook for a hand in this most recognizable short br br people can lick too this is probably the scariest and most dark of the stories a young girl chats with another girl on the internet but it turns out that it's actually a man who is obsessed with her and he proceeds to break into the house when she's alone this was really chilling br br the this is also a great story with glen quinn and barrett who play a motorcyclist and a beautiful mute girl who are terrorized by ghosts from a previous century in a mysterious farm house this was good but it was the weakest of the entries br br the group around the campfire slowly develop their own terrifying experience in their segments between stories and the end of this movie is surprising and really awesome overall this is not bone chillingly scary but it's certainly a great little guilty pleasure that horror fans alike would definitely find worthwhile
<START> a real surprise not exactly family entertainment from disney some violence lots of tense moments and a great story based on fact the theme of night crossing is determination wins never losing sight of their objective two east german families risk it all in their daring balloon escape to freedom the story is both harrowing and heartwarming time is not on their side the east german police are closing in and the outcome far from certain until the very end if you are looking for a good evenings entertainment that contains no nudity and limited violence then i highly recommend night crossing it is pure entertainment merk
<START> i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2 i gave it an extra star just because david keith's gun was cool
<START> i had watched this on italian tv as a kid and recall being fond of it â in view of its mixing live action with animation however it was universally panned at the catching up with it again after all these years i have to admit that the critics were right br br what must have seemed wondrous to a child's eyes is actually very poorly done not to mention boring for a fantasy adventure fatally both star ex young man' richard harris and director action expert hunt are ill suited to the material at least michel score with lyrics provided by scriptwriter don black is serviceable â if not exactly inspired by the way a number of well known personalities are featured among the voice artists on this british belgian co production julian glover bessie love murray melvin robert graham stark and this being his last film work michael bates br br while the essential plot points of jonathan swift's classic novel gulliver becomes the pawn in a war between the little people of two neighboring countries and on escaping ends up in a land of real giants do emerge here it's done on a strictly kiddie level with stereotyped characters though thankfully little intrusion of the comic romantic variety â which renders the whole venture somewhat pointless outside of its intrinsically experimental nature since max and dave fleischer had already done a splendid feature length cartoon version of the book way back in 1939
<START> just finished watching this movie as it were playing on tv and i did'nt have anything else to do went right here to imdb too look on the trivia page and happened to glance at the user comments and what do i find every dumb idiot raises this movie to the sky i would'nt even have written anything but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this suck ass movie i thought that i could br br the acting sucked from pretty much everyone in the cast the worst one was the guy playing brian wilson think i got the name right as he were overacting especially when he was high the rest was'nt as bad as him but no one was good neither i ain't no expert on the beach boys though so cant really complain on the story that much except it sucked though no motivation for any of the characters decisions most of the time but hey maybe they were idiots in real life to and what i found worst was that i thought it were going to be a movie about the beach boys but you really only got a grip about a few of the characters i hate when they do that in movies same thing in the doors even though i like that movie more don't have any energy left to write more it sucked don't buy or watch it
<START> let's get tough is one of those movies that people probably regret years later that they made full of awful racist jap talk and jokes this east end kids story details how the kids want to join the military to defeat the japs since they're too young they decide to clean the town out of those dastardly japs they find one throw fruit at it without anyone doing anything to stop them and he pulls a short sword out to menace them the cops say to stop annoying him he's only chinese he's on our side when the kids go back to apologize the chinese man's dead it's all part of this huge jap and german spy ring the kids see to it that this is stopped at all costs i'm sure all of this was fine when it was made 1942 but viewed now you realize of course that this is clearly a product of it's time full of stereotypes german and japanese funny how the east end kids have a black kid in the group and he's not spared either gee whiz
<START> tom hanks returns as dan brown's robert langdon in his first adventure angels demons which hollywood decided to make after the da vinci code given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself the catholic church was up in arms over the first film but seemingly nonchalant about this one and it's not hard to see why considering ron howard had opted to do a flat out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of rome and vatican city and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on location scenes save for st peter's square and which was a scaled model used br br so i guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets the ensemble cast had to be scaled down tried to step into the female void left by audrey tautou but given tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film scientist had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti matter in the book she's the fodder of course for langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the vatican the and the great feud between the two but here she's neither love interest nor his intellectual equal br br ewan mcgregor on the other hand chews up each scene he's in as patrick mckenna who is temporarily taking care of the papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the sistine chapel to elect a new pope and he plays patrick with that glint in the eye with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye there's no surprises here for readers of the novel but mcgregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as hanks plays well tom hanks br br the book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion and a wealth of information that dan brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work while reading the book some years ago i thought that should a film be made of it it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces sadly that's what this ron howard film did with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some discussion time over a cup of tea this one moved things along so quickly it's like reading the book all over again page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action br br catholic reviewers have called angels demons harmless because i guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies unlike the da vinci code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith and if anything this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath st peter's and the vatican archives remain out of bounds but the walk along the path of illumination now that's almost free br br nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive but for those who haven't this film may just compel you to pick up dan brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks and characters such as galileo michelangelo and who are intricately linked to the plot but much left unsaid satisfying pop corn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular
<START> this film is like the breakfast club meets mad city it's got one plot twist after another with justin walker corey feldman and james remar delivering really great performances however this movie is not for everyone if you don't like movies that go all the way with regards to violence then don't watch the last twenty minutes my wife had to leave the room of course i couldn't take my eyes off the screen this is a really gritty realistic teen drama i can't believe it came from b movie king roger corman this film is a must see for those who are not faint of heart highly recommended
<START> bobbie phillips who in her own right has amassed a great list of credits as a hard working hollywood actress shines in this third installment of upn and village chameleon series in this installment the sexual innuendo has been toned down with kam showing a caring maternal side towards a recently orphaned genius teen bobbie delivers this role to the viewers with great the action and stunts were the best in the series
<START> i saw this video 2000 years ago and would love to see it on dvd a good film but i would have loved it even more if it had included the legacy of the beatles and the etc br br i also don't know exactly how true the story is were some changes made to dramatize the story br br i was only 3 when buddy crashed and didn't wake up to his music until the late 70's much later i found out our family moved into our new house on yes february 3rd 1959 br br well little things you say and do his songs will always be remembered always
<START> this is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics and is a must see for all psychotronic fans why it has everything a great 70s exploitation film should have over the top dialog bad acting enthusiasm sex sleaze political incorrectness violence and many other elements of a good cult classic are included in other words dolemite is a must see br br as with a lot of these films the plot makes little to no sense what i picked up from it is that pimp hustler dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics while he was doing time his arch nemesis willie green the same man who framed him took over his nightclub however the sympathetic warden the only white character in the whole movie that isn't completely evil or incompetent decides to spring him free to stop the evil willie green and his drug trafficking luckily he knows kung fu as does about 50 to 75 of the characters in this film do and even more luckily while he was locked up the madam queen bee sent all his to kung fu school with this army of kung fu fighting his words not mine on his side he plans to take back the nightclub from willie green however two racist white cops try to frame him up again and have him thrown back in jail br br as i said earlier don't try to follow the plot i've seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connections to anything else supporting characters wander in and out of the film i'm still attempting to figure out what was up with reverend gibbs the mayor and the hamburger pimp who cares ultimately the scenes with these characters are all priceless as for the dialog its horrible with even worse delivery since rudy ray moore was originally a comedian i begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof or a serious action film it seems he couldn't decide which one lines such as yeah i'm so bad i kick my own ass twice a day call for further investigation either way the film is hilarious and the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese factory another hilarious element is some of the most unerotic uses of sex and nudity ever in film actors that you would never want to see naked get naked including the mayor and queen bee not to mention the fact that the boom mic seems to show up in every other scene br br most of all moore shows incredible enthusiasm he seems to be having a generally good time and is certainly charismatic his comedy raps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta rap including dr dre who sampled him on his groundbreaking 1992 album the chronic as technically inept as the film is it is culturally influential even more important it is an all around good time the biggest crime an exploitation film can commit is being boring and this for all its flaws is quickly paced and entertaining in other words if you dig this kind of film you'll love dolemite if you don't dig it you're a no business born insecure jock jawed f a 7 10
