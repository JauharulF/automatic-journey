<START> stick around is one of the brief series of films that paired bobby ray with oliver 'babe' hardy before hardy's immortal teaming with stan laurel several critics have suggested that ray and hardy the gormless little man and the overbearing big man were a prototype for laurel and hardy but that simply isn't true ray and hardy play off each other well but really aren't a team in each of these films ray has more footage and is clearly meant to be the hero while hardy bullies him in a manner very much unlike his later ollie character's treatment of stanley it's very clear that the relationship between little bobby and big babe was inspired by earlier chaplin films in which the little tramp was bullied by huge mack swain or burly eric campbell br br however in stick around hardy sports a bowler hat that's identical to his later ollie although with a fuller moustache and he and bobby after spending most of this movie as adversaries end up as drunken comrades br br bobby is a for the firm of and with hardy as his boss when the bobby tries to pretend he showed up promptly there's some clever physical business between the two men that reminds me of a routine performed by roscoe arbuckle and buster keaton in 'the a bit later bobby ray whose brief acting career never firmly developed a screen persona performs an impossible gag that would have been inappropriate for stan laurel when he pulls a long out of a much smaller br br the go to work in a sanitarium and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness one resident insists on sitting on a piece of toast because he thinks he's a egg there are also some howlingly racist and tastelessly unfunny gags involving a black man who obligingly lets the inmates crack open walnuts on top of his head when he sees a picture of a lion not even a photograph mind you he goes all cowardly as if it were an actual wild animal br br stick around is fairly dire most of the pantomime and acting is much broader than it needs to be for a slapstick comedy even hardy already a very subtle actor by 1925 badly with his over acting here there are several bad examples of shot matching i was impressed with one unusual camera set up when a fat face is and we see a close up of his reflection in a hand mirror rather than his actual face br br spoilers coming during their brief pairing hardy typically played ray's boss or adversary or both here for once they end up as pals it's a nice ending but it doesn't make up for what's really a poor film my rating for this one is only 4 out of 10
<START> this is an emperor's new clothes situation someone needs to say that's not a funny and original etc etc film that is an inferior film don't waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash they are all too realistically only themselves they have no lines they don't act the american dream is not to create shoddy no quality films or anything else shoddy and of no quality it is to achieve something of quality and thereby success only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it can't have been made in hollywood can it would try to any kind of quality to this film it's worse than ed woods another film about a film maker without standards these films shouldn't have been made and you shouldn't go see american movie
<START> i only wish that i had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when i knew it was terrible br br instead i gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better br br don't make the same mistake i did br br the title has nothing to do with the movie the movie has nothing to do with the real world the plot has nothing to do with a plot the acting consists of a guy who wants to be john cusack but can't pull it off the lead is a girl who tries to be claire daines sadly she can't pull that off either they are in love although god only knows why and by the end i was hoping that they would all kill each other off just so i could believe none of these kids would ever taint the world again
<START> alien warrior or king of the streets is one of those 80s gems you stumble across by mistake then watch awestruck marveling at how wonderfully silly and over the top it gets br br a rather hunky alien arrives on earth la to be exact and stumbles into a world of drug dealers gangs and corrupt cops he falls in love with the haired beautiful teacher who only wants to help inner city kids read more he also manages to anger a coke snorting drug kingpin who vows to destroy him br br i fell in love with this film at first viewing sure it's hokey silly and low budget but you can tell the filmmakers had their heart in the right place and damn if the thing doesn't work i only pray it'll be on dvd soon br br it's got a hot soundtrack break dancing violence nudity all with a positive wholesome message see it
<START> i was forced to watch this film for my world geography class this film is what is wrong with america today instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault this film goes through the downfall of flint michigan and blames it 100 on general motors in the process of doing so moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of general motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society moore films several throughout the film and does not ever even ask once if the person is being evicted because of a gm additionally he never interviews the landlords of the tenants filmed moore goes to great lengths to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda
<START> this movie worked for me because i see this movie as an exact opposite of with the wind ' farm owners instead of plantation owners scarlett fights and for what she wants ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until ruby renee zellweger shows up to save the day sort of in a round about way instead of officers trying to get back to their families the lists goes on and on even the love story was opposite if this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me br br there are only two things i didn't like about the movie the rest i thought was well done and i liked it enough to recommend it to friends first i couldn't see the attraction between jude law and ada nicole kidman as being strong enough for to desert to get back to her said he only had written to her a few times where ada wrote to him almost constantly second something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much i must say it was full of action because of that but after about the second scene i knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene i like to be surprised by the next scene not know what is going to happen before it does br br i thought all the acting was very well done with zellweger the best she deserved the credit she got for it i thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well she must have done her homework on the part zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was i think that was true law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to kidman it must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than i thought it was now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact i chose her performance after the other two except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion i don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part she still did a good job i just thought the other two were better br br i liked the scene with the zellweger kidman and the rooster even though it was one of those scenes i mentioned above i thought the 'home guard' was exactly as they probably were back then even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time i thought the scenery was beautiful the movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance
<START> not only is the great rock n roll swindle thoroughly inaccurate but when it comes down to it not much about it is interesting or even entertaining malcolm mclaren apparently squandered the majority of the sex pistols earnings on this waste of film which makes it that much more obnoxious the intention from the beginning was to create a monument to the genius of mclaren who to this day takes full credit for creating punk music creating the sex pistols and at times even writing all the songs viewers follow mclaren to various settings where he tells his story to his sidekick a female dwarf and simply takes credit for one thing after another one particularly irritating scene has mclaren in an abandoned airplane hangar waiting for a plane being hounded by reporters and giving them their big story the most entertaining elements of the film are the animated short pieces however even these reek of mclaren's overbearing self importance br br even as a farce this film doesn't work little about it is entertaining except for steve jones who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo detective type person 20 years later julien temple who wrote and directed this film also directed the sex pistols documentary the filth and the fury while that movie is much better and more interesting than swindle it still is full of temple's artistic flourishes that just don't work like interviewing band members in shadow as if they are some kind of crime witness trying to hide their identity an interesting bit of trivia film critic roger ebert was one of the original scriptwriters for the movie who killed bambi which eventually became swindle
<START> in print this is one of the greatest short stories ever written brought brilliantly and poetically to the screen by this father son team working together sadly for the first and last time it is fitting that john huston should end his career on a high note by bringing the work of one of his favorite author's to the screen in what is easily the best joyce screen adaptation huston made a career of adapting great works of literature to film usually quite successfully it is sad and somewhat puzzling that tony huston pretty much began and ended his career in film by adapting what would be his father's final project and picking up a well deserved oscar nomination in the process br br i once had the privilege of sitting in the company of the great screenwriter playwright horton foote who cited this film as one of his favorites in recent years at the time it was still a fairly recent release as a rather prolific screenwriter himself and a brilliant screen adapter of his own works as well as great authors such as faulkner and harper lee he was obviously impressed with tony huston's first time effort and possibly equally puzzled by his lack of output since then if anyone has insights to share on the topic i'd be interested to hear more
<START> a whole lot of the people that have seen this are confused obviously the original title of joe would've put things into better perspective for much of the viewing audience i have personally experienced the condition of often accompanied by a really bad hangover after a weekend bender and it is indeed a lot like the movie skeleton man a dry scummy film that provokes regret for recent choices and begs for a hot shower br br it is unfortunate that the choice of skeleton man for the title was by the distributor probably the work of some meddling hollywood no nothing studio exec who just didn't get it and not joe those of us who have seen the film know that the skeleton man is actually joe a skeletal manish apparition not a true skeleton man the deception of the folks marketing this film is unforgivable and for that alone i cannot give this film a high rating imagine this when future filmmakers get together to create the true definitive skeleton man movie and need a title they will be totally screwed and we are all as serious fans of the genre diminished for that br br joe could've become a horror movie icon right up there alongside madman black claw mansquito humongous nature boy billy morty the wooden doll the the moon beast bloody bill the driller killer mickey rooney and so forth but he will always be remembered as a sword wielding caped tackle dummy skull face tied to the side of a horse skeleton man wannabe br br that's too bad
<START> having read this story a while ago i was very excited to see the movie i read the book again it is one of my favorite nicholas sparks books what i think what makes the story is the relationships that was the down point for me in the movie because i think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie i have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles tim's and alan's characters the movie didn't at all capture john and relationship maybe if you haven't read the book you might like this movie but i thought it was so dull compared to the book i thought channing was a great pick for john but i had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it so i think it was more geared towards them the ending cuts the whole point of the book out so i was also unhappy with that i was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books i do feel like i wasted a friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story not at all the story i was expecting to see
<START> there could be some spoilers ahead but i doubt it i have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder it's horrible completely unwatchable i hung in there for 45 minutes about half the running time and just couldn't stand it anymore i was an elijah wood fan in the '90s see the war and i learned to enjoy mandy moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year see chasing liberty which is surprisingly entertaining i've seen bits of run lola run so with three leads i liked this should have been fine it wasn't nobody turned in a good performance wood's jones was flat for an aspiring writer he had next to no imagination his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from a christmas story and his lustful ones were huh a cross between boring and alarming potente is absolutely unlikable from the first second and i'd only know that she was supposed to be the girl by reading the box speaking of the synopsis whoever they employed for that job made the film sound funny quirky romantic and quite enjoyable whoever that person was he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script by the halfway point i didn't care about any of the characters anymore moore's lisa is an aspiring actress who's bubbly and a little conniving for no apparent reason at all but her ludicrous period play which is supposed to be funny in presentation is on a par with the rest of the script there is supposedly a happy romantic comedy ending to this turkey given the character material they had to work with i just can't envision it save your money warn your friends don't watch this movie
<START> alien express is one of the worst movies i've bothered to experience br br the plot is predictable the aliens look like rubber sock puppets the effects would have been mediocre in the 70's but are just atrocious by today's standards couldn't they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious model br br the acting isn't great but really the dialogue is the worst part it gouges its way into your mind don't you die on me not now if you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie you'll rapidly be jolted painfully back to reality by the aliens the model train or the clichÃ©d dialogue br br the only reason i didn't give this movie a 1 is that it doesn't deserve to be rated so badly that some poor suckers might watch it for the pleasure inherent in a truly bad film
<START> it comes as no surprise that was married to elem who would later direct the most harrowing war film ever made 'come and see 1985 ' 'the ascent 1977 ' Â final completed film before a premature death Â is built in very much the same mould set during wwii the film follows a pair of soviet partisans who try to secure food for their starving army while evading the occupying german forces the first forty minutes are agonisingly tense as the two men drag themselves though the harsh snow covered landscape the world around them completely sapped of life warmth and colour indeed so monotonously drab is the scenery that it literally took me this long to realise that the film was shot in black and white br br following the capture by german soldiers the film becomes a cold meditation on loyalty and morality whereas boris refuses to betray his army even under extreme duress the less resolute vladimir attempts to save himself is he wrong to do so betrayal is disheartening but the film doesn't immediately condemn his actions are treacherous instead the viewer is forced to consider what their own response might be in such a situation pities as the bible pities judas both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to watch them executed however whereas judas committed suicide by hanging at least according to gospel of matthew finds even that option closed to him Â in an excruciatingly taut climax the belt around his neck becomes unfastened br br 'the draws its emotional power from astonishing pursuit of realism i have no doubt that the two principal actors spent days on end across the snow covered earth on their hands and knees and indeed so convincing is their misery that i actually developed a cold while watching the film seriously i did interestingly the film on this reality on several occasions as imagines himself making a bid for freedom and then being gunned down by his german captors this device though unusual works well with its biblical allegory is facing a trial of his worthiness and faced with a new dilemma at every turn he consistently chooses the selfish alternative his own life the only deciding criteria at film's end he is still alive but the nightmare of war and guilt persists
<START> this movie is engaging from start to finish with excellent performances a great soundtrack with original music by douglas brown and a well paced script that's full of surprises br br full of new and not so new faces this movie showcases promising talent especially in the case of craig morris who plays the main character eddie monroe morris who also co wrote the script displays a quiet strength combined with a strong emotional performance as he creates a believable character on screen also a poignant delivery by paul who plays uncle benny with a genuine warmth was so convincing that he made me hungry as he lovingly prepared his italian sauce br br great new faces great new music and a great new story what more could you ask for this film is highly recommended
<START> a bus drops off a nameless man outside a run down standard oil gas station in the middle of nowhere we never learn where the bus came from or why he is on it or who he even is why is he the only passenger is he a prisoner is he the bothersome man referred to in the title of the movie has he died and gone to heaven or hell like our man we don't get a chance to stop and wonder he is met by a gatekeeper of sorts and shuttled off to a nondescript city from day one all the choices are made for him an apartment has been rented a job has been found an office assigned in fact his life is not entirely unlike life in the virtual reality of corporate and suburban condos women are heartless dinner parties are a drag office jobs suck but some pieces don't fit the puzzle silently efficient gray clad goons roam the streets are they some sort of paramedics or the secret police and why are there no children is the story even set in the real world whenever we think we might be getting some answers new mysteries unfold the bothersome man leaves you half relieved that it's over half wanting more i hope they make it into a computer game soon
