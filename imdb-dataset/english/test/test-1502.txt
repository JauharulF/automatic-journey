<START> i saw this dvd on sale and bought it without a second thought despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time as soon as i got home i raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed while it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book the similarities end there the characters are changed ie seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly scenes are misplaced or altogether changed ie many characters are missing and famous lines thought are missing the movie does attempt to portray some feeling that the previous one lacked but it is done in a lackluster way that makes for a flat boring movie it is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book such a classic and this movie takes those things and utterly destroys them in its rewriting
<START> this short was the first short released by paramount famous studios and was one of several done by the studio showing popeye engaged directly against the enemy most often the japanese while warner brothers disney and to a lesser extent other studios did shorts often depicting germans as foils the majority of famous studios efforts focused on the japanese given pearl harbor and popeye's naval ties this is quite understandable this is an average short red white an' blue and spinach for britain have aged better but it's still worth watching recommended
<START> enhanced by the expressive cinematography of agnes godard beau travail golden door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in sicily to ellis island in new york at the turn of the century it is a surreal enigmatic often strange but ultimately deeply rewarding experience interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism the latest film by emanuele is like an impressionistic painting a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents magical mystery tour came about as a result of his visit to the museum on ellis island the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants br br guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal to salvatore mancuso vincenzo amato and his older son angelo francesco america is a distant dream that they know nothing about after climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by younger son pietro a deaf mute that depict the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk sit under a money tree or harvest giant onions and carrots br br after disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits salvatore his two sons and his elderly mother aurora set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation but the equation soon shifts the other way as they board the boat and settle into their crowded third class steerage compartments the most talked about scene in the film takes place using an overhead camera that shows masses of people standing as the ship pulls away the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated implies they are being torn asunder from everything familiar br br aboard the ship is a mysterious english woman named lucy charlotte gainsbourg does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to america but she seems to stand for the onset of the modern world they are entering though they eye each other cautiously lucy becomes interested in salvatore and asks him to marry her in order to allow her to enter the country the voyage is treacherous with a violent storm buffeting the ship shot in almost complete darkness passengers in steerage are tossed against the side of the boat and afterward bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor as if in a macabre the rite of passage through immigration processing at ellis island does not become any easier and attacks the way illiterate peasants in the name of preserving civilized society are forced to put puzzles together perform mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove they are fit br br a marriage ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women look despondent when they are matched with overweight middle aged men this is the only way they can enter the golden door however since single women are rejected unless they have partners ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution through the fog the can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no statue of liberty asking for the tired and the poor the humbled masses yearning to breathe free in their imagination however the river is still flowing waiting for them to jump in though the ending is ambiguous and one door opens on to a blank wall another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we must all take from the old world to the new
<START> this was an interesting study in societal sexuality as well as the dark interests of man br br while i can't say the wife was a strong character she was the wrong choice for the part in my opinion she was a rich kid in search of escaping her drool life she was a rebel in fact and never fully matured for her husband a lawyer rickman it's obvious he married her for her money and to cover his sexual desires which is taboo rickman played his part to a tee his flirtations with the young man and very subtle undertones of gayness the young man was gay to the hilt when he did marilyn impersonation that should have told the wife everything he was perfectly cast as well he has hustler written all over him br br i was not crazy about the ending as i knew what was coming overall though the acting from rickman was great reedus was good walker was okay but i had misgivings for a gay themed movie it was average but not blatant at least it's worth viewing if you don't have truly madly deeply lying around for a spin
<START> i haven't read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on but who knows maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health it isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i've read on one hand but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire i get the feeling that she writes really good novels the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history br br still stuart townsend's voice over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt's vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that queen of the limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline while interview decided to go with lace and elegance queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places the costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack br br however i'll give credit where credit is due the soundtrack is excellent and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead br br the film opens with a very cool goth rock zoom splice montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing degenerates quickly it's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects unfortunately queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress where are the yellow contacts where's the pale blue make up scene after scene i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem's lot and fright night when low budget was done right br br there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage props to aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace she might have become a renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so prematurely for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing did i mention that the soundtrack was good let's see what else can i say it wasn't too long the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second rate vampire movies out there the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything br br br br dot com
<START> this movie has too many things going on another reviewer comments on the disjointed episodic nature of the film as reflecting the director's memories that's fine if that is how it was written and performed instead what we get is straight forward narrative some of the time that jumps around under and over leaves us dangling in some instances interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other instances and otherwise simply doesn't work br br there are also some plot details that just don't work for example why drag a body onto a beach in an urban area in broad daylight as opposed to night time why leave your flat sheet on the body why would an artist who knew the joe character for a brief time decide to leave him everything even if it wasn't much this sub plot was poorly developed to make that point work for that matter why even have the man be an invalid or an artist other than to provide the money and the gratuitous nude posing scenes he could just as easily have been a photographer or a opera composer for that matter how does someone rate an apartment in an opera house particularly without some clear connection to the opera the coincidences are also both too obvious and to unclear and unexplained why would the guys take everything in the warehouse and disappear if tim was a 10 year old school mate in a town as small as how could joe lose track of him for 8 years especially if they knew each other well enough that one would recommend the other for a job br br some of the other subplots like the mother and her boyfriend s and the sister wanting to escape felt like padding there's some good ideas that might have made a feature with full development or could have been interesting shorts as completed this movie made little sense and offers even less
<START> i must warn you there are some spoilers in it but to start it off i got spanish judges on february i think it was mention it was the last copy but as i see it wasn't back ordered but either way i have it i thought it was good i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor matthew lillard i'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar although it is kind of low budget getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending man what a good actor br br the story it about a con artist known as jack matthew lillard who claims to have merchandises called the spanish judges if you don't know what spanish judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read i won't even say what they are i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was he needs protection so he hires a couple who are also crooks max and jamie vincent d'onofrio and valeria golino as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece mark boone junior he has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from mars as she said so they mainly jack call her mars girl everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game a game that involves some lust lies and betrayal br br there was some over acting in it matt and valeria as well as tamara were not one of them there were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well some of the score was actually good the theme they used for the beginning and the end before the credits was a good song choice that's my opinion the fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent but what can you do one more comment on matt damn he plays a smooth slick con man br br i know this is a review but i need to make a correction towards necro one of the reviewers valeria golino is not a newcomer according to this site she has been acting since 1983 to me and hopefully to others she is well known as charlie sheen's italian love interest in both the hot shots movies but good review br br although i think it's one of the rare films i've seen and it's really good which is why i gave it 10 stars above i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it br br 8 10
<START> while the songs and dance numbers in general aren't as strong as many would have them be the film's storyline and message are still there and ring out loudly above the simple 70s style musical numbers br br keeping in mind that this film was made after the hollywood musical had nearly died out with few exceptions being rock musicals the audiences that went to see it new didn't appreciate the fact that it was a brave attempt at something that hadn't been done to date audiences that see it today will tend to judge it against the films and musicals of today and perhaps the huge all star casts of musicals gone past but to do that to this film or any for that matter is an injustice to the film itself br br there are some good musical moments in the film the first is that of bobby van mr van took his role of harry lovett just after closing a 2 year tony nominated for best actor run of the broadway revival no no nanette he is a song and dance man from way back and honestly the only one in the cast that was truly talented and experienced for musicals he never misses a step in his question me an answer and rightly so he was totally at home as harry other pleasant numbers are done by olivia hussey when she welcomes the new visitors and while the lyrics are weak james shows his strong voice in the family song as well as a nicely done staging of the full piece br br view the film for what it is a fantasy about a place where you never grow old hidden in the ice and snow covered mountains of tibet found by a group of unsuspecting modern day people wrapped up in the strife of any modern culture take this and compare it to reality and you get a film that falls short of a goal but take this film for the message of love and peace and tranquility and brotherly love and you get a warm and refreshing message and a positive one at that br br to some this film may seem corny to others a welcomed release from the hectic pace of reality to the first try to not judge and just enjoy the message to the second you have discovered the secret of shangri la
<START> first off this is the worst movie i've ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way it's boring implausible poorly shot ridiculously scripted and lacking in cool disaster effects br br worse it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun wallowing in a sense of japanese uniqueness and everyone abandons the japanese in their hour of need particularly the koreans the most noble characters choose going down with their ship as their beloved island sinks only japanese would think this way says the prime minister br br if this movie in any way reflects the japanese opinion of their place in world opinion the first thing they should do to rectify the problem is stop making movies like this
<START> this movie starts out with this creepy song that gave me some chills like the song used in nightmare on it immediately sets the mood the sequence that follows also shows what to expect we are made aware that a ghost is present the mystery concerning this ghost is what keeps this movie together but the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense of it the ideas behind the plot are quite interesting only the way it is told to us is far too abstract i understand that the director believed that he had to maintain the mystery as long as possible the problem is that when certain matters get revealed you never get a satisfying explanation the motives of the important characters are left out and some questions raised in the movie don't get answered at all since we don't learn enough about the characters it becomes hard to care for them and as a consequence you will loose interest only some scares and a twist save this movie from becoming a total failure the twist is interesting but no real shocker the experienced viewer will see it coming some reviewers complain that this movie is too much like ringu and is not original at all well it is true that some of the effects and scares are borrowed from that movie but there is a main difference the suspense in ringu mainly was based on this one twist where the viewer finds out how the characters get killed in the ringu like twist is used as a creepy effect to accompany another crazy twist heavily depends on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn't contain enough scares to hold your interest simply put this isn't a scary movie
<START> this is the epitome of bad 80's film making unless you are a pre pubescent girl riding on a big name like madonna a story line that physically assaults one's intelligence and humour that is most suited for a nursery school if there was ever any doubt i think this turd of a movie clearly displays madonna's absolute lack of acting talent and made me feel highly embarrassed on her behalf the only thing i can't believe is that they ever let the director near another movie again madonna spends most of the movie prancing around like an infantile rag doll and talking like a baby it is painfully obvious that the only reason this movie was ever made was due to the fact that madonna was a big name in pop music at the time do not be duped into seeing this awful attempt to cash in on pop stardom stay away at all costs
<START> great cast great acting great music each character in this movie had their own stories and personalities and it's vivid a great movie not to be missed
<START> in a way you have to respect it's clearly meant as a tribute to the big bug movies of the fifties and while the special effects look terrible at least the film doesn't feature cgi however on the other hand you can't respect the film too much because it's a load of rubbish the acting is terrible the special effects as mentioned are impossible to take seriously and once you've seen one giant spider being blown up you've seen them all so it gets boring rather quickly the plot follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower they go to the only house in the area which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction coincidently around the same time the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from underground all the characters in this film are poor caricatures none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they will soon begin to thoroughly bore you you've got to feel for director brett piper as he clearly didn't have much to work with for this film but that doesn't make worth a damn and overall there are better giant bug films than this and therefore doesn't get the seal of approval from me
<START> wow we watched this film in the hopes that it would have at least some decent rock climbing scenes we were disappointed there but it was still a great movie it was soooo cheesy it was great i haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time if you are into rock climbing and you enjoy cheesy movies then this one is absolutely for you
<START> last night i got to see an early preview screener of prozac nation because i love everything that christina ricci does i was very excited at first but as the movie continued i started to wonder where it was going based on a true story it is simply about christina ricci's character and her struggle with depression drugs friends and family as you can probably tell from the title in my opinion this movie moved too fast and it was way too dramatic i would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes and the movie moved through her life extremely fast and this left no room for us to connect with christina ricci's character christina ricci's performance was fantastic as always but jessica lange stood out throughout the whole movie and i believe this movie's success will be all because of her and christina ricci i would rate this 4 out of 10 and i would suggest you rent this one or read the books by elizabeth they are good and definitely worth checking out
