<START> this really is a movie that you need to see twice when i first saw this film i was really drawn into the story while the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room the stories that buddy nick drake wonderful allusion and daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels the soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly dark lo fi and intriguing when you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending i have seen in a long time i hope to see this movie find a distributor for the dvd so that it will be more accessible great movie you won't be disappointed
<START> barney and friends is probably the worst kids show that i have ever seen it teaches kids nothing the songs are corny it is not educational and the characters are just plain i am not one to disagree with those who hate the show honestly i have seen more negative than positive reviews for this show 75 of the reviews are negative and there are some really mature people this show contains no educational value or age appropriate educational material whatsoever more reasons why i dislike this show is because of the crappy plots cheesy dialogue horrid special effects and the abysmal story lines besides it says that you should eat junk food if you are sad and that strangers are your friends saying that is a model of what preschool television should be as expressed by yale researchers dorothy and jerome singer is a load of crap they don't know what they're talking about i would never recommend barney to anyone te reason why some kids keep crying for or get addicted to junk is because of this show poisoning the minds of children everywhere for people parents children who seek real preschool mater switch over to nick jr and watch super why instead it's far more better than this turd and five tv once had the nerve to put it on but thankfully took it off i highly advise everyone to keep far away from this show as possible parents i highly advise you to keep your kids as far away from this show as possible they'll thank you later br br bottom line don't bother wasting your valuable time with this stupid show it's utter garbage 10000000000000 10 grade z avoid like the plague br br thanks for reading
<START> this four hour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary primarily because the filmmakers seemed not to have a clear idea how to adapt a novel to the screen they seemed not to know what should be kept in and what might safely be left out the film opens with sir walter reading from the book that is his primary solace in his troubles this introduces the family all of whom we get to know intimately over the next four hours anyway but serves little other purpose similarly the scenes where the lament poor richard serve no purpose but to drag the story down some of austen's actual dialogue is allocated to different characters and some of her narrative is recycled as dialogue that falls awkwardly from the tongues of the characters there is some fill in dialogue too and this is uniformly dreadful the scene where charles hayter is boring henrietta with his concerns about getting dr shirley's was only barely interesting as narrative in the book as a scene in this production it is stultifying the scene on the cobb when louisa falls and is taken up lifeless is entirely without urgency and i wondered whether wentworth's line is there nobody to help me might have been directed at the writers as well as the other actors br br this production often looks and feels like a play that has been filmed rather than an actual film and this is most evident in the acting which is the opposite of subtle booming delivery of lines exaggerated gestures and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands feet or faces when they are not speaking their lines charles musgrove stands in his parlour feet shoulder width apart and appears to project to the balcony if there were one when speaking to the other people in the room with him louisa face when not actively simpering or giggling seems to be in confused repose louisa is a giddy giggly ditzy creature and i did not for a moment believe that wentworth would be interested in her br br the costumes are a mixed bunch but mostly awful and anne elliot's green tartan gown is quite possibly the most hideous alleged period costume ever devised we are given the dates at the beginning of the show it is the late or perhaps very early 1800s and yet many of the costumes seem to be of victorian design and thus about 60 years too early the hair is just so wrong that i won't even mention it here except to say that i won't mention it br br this production does do some things right however mrs smith is given her proper importance and her history with mr elliot his and his intrigues are fully addressed i was also pleased to see the fleshed out reconciliation scenes with anne and frederick at the end which are precious reward for the reader but were glossed over in the 1995 production br br if you love the book persuasion and even vaguely like the 1995 movie don't waste a moment or a penny on this production you will find it sorely wanting
<START> i remember seeing this movie as a child in the 60's it took my breath away then at young age i was glued to my seat in front of the black and white tv the cast was one of the best i have seen in my life the musical was one the greatest ever have been written please to the gershwin and goldwyn families please release this on video or dvd so that the generations now and in the future can experience what i'm sure what so many of us have done when we saw this great work of art please consider let not this great man's work go unseen for years more i m praying and hoping that the hearts of these families will be soften and let the world see this great movie again
<START> i'll have to admit that i'm at a disadvantage here when i learn more about a film from other reviewers than from watching it myself then that's a problem although the plot of the man who knew too much seems generally straightforward the movie allows too many cryptic elements to get in the way of what could have been a satisfying mystery by the time we get to the scene where a witchy looking woman establishes the secrecy of the first degree of the seven fold ray i didn't know whether to laugh or rewind to see if i missed something br br in retrospect the cryptic note retrieved by mr lawrence leslie banks from the handle of a shaving brush was a craftily written message leading to a dentist named and eventually to the albert hall a place not a person as indicated by a hall but for all the intrigue it's never made clear why the assassination target was being eliminated okay so louis bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to assassinate a diplomat named but why was a target come to think of it why was the note even written and secured in the shaving brush did bernard have to refer to it every now and then to remind himself what was going to happen br br with it's disjointed scenes the man who knew too much is hard to follow and a bit disorienting however i'll give alfred hitchcock credit for this early effort for perspective i'll have to watch some of his other work of the same era though this movie certainly can't hold a candle to his later works like psycho or north by northwest
<START> i saw this film at a small screening even though it had a low budget the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie it's april 8 1994 each of the characters are in their mid 20's and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition acting music film writing when they learn of nirvana singer kurt suicide they quickly get inspiration to travel from san francisco to seattle and attend the cobain vigil it's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes highlights include a visit to jimi grave kurt original childhood home and a campfire sing along an honest an original piece of work
<START> tim burton is in essence an expressionist film maker disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with gothic scope opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career however with his style being so poignantly endearing i like many moviegoers forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially one hundred million dollar art films br br it's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise especially when that franchises target audience are half witted 15 year old boys batman returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor ensuring box office draw and cheap in actual fact very expensive thrills being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience had this been the result then tim burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment instead burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase 'out there' br br from the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prison like containing their newly born deformed baby into a river it is clear that batman returns ain't no picnic at buckingham palace cut to thirty three years later during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon max portrayed by christopher walken the red triangle circus gang attack gotham city batman michael keaton returning to the role makes his first appearance sporting a new logo eventually saving the day is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and black mailed into endorsing the political return of the baby now a fully grown penguin man danny devito in hideously perfect make up whose motives for return are suspicious only to batman br br meanwhile attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant selina kyle played perfectly by michelle pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic catwoman out for revenge and harbours for some unexplained reason a deadly vendetta against the dark knight br br batman returns is bleak the production design is breathtaking delivering a cold haunting gotham city with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor danny elfman's score supports the film brilliantly ranging from invigorating to tragic the tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding shot like a sad nightmare burton's direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for burton's visual style of film making and whilst burton's action sequences struggle for exhilaration the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters the penguins demise the catwoman's mental state and bruce wayne's lonely destiny br br warner brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed after all they wanted a batman sequel not a weird somewhat ghastly horror movie in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies all the while vomiting what can only be described as green the production company wanted an audience friendly feature something for the mcdonald's clan to promote their happy meals with not a movie of dire irredeemable characters including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingers br br it's easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of batman returns the film never felt like a batman blockbuster it is questionable if burton really knew who batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations this is why burton failed to create a great batman film he did however create a nostalgic and stunning ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine br br this may not be a great batman movie but it is a great tim burton film
<START> gerry anderson's first live action foray in the way of a major motion picture that benefits from incredible model fx work and a great barry gray music score the reel to reel analog computers in the far off year i guess anderson really wanted a safe date of a 100 years later are a hoot to see as are the guru jacket fashions but one could easily accuse 2001 of the same violations but no one could have foreseen some things as they turn out this film was the springboard for the series ufo the following year and in fact not only had the same fx people and producers but many of the cast were regulars in that show br br it always comes off like an alternate history future more than anything else the apollo like rocket used in the lift off it always seems like this is really another planet than earth given the alternate earth plot one would assume that was the feeling they wanted we end up with an ending that posits more questions than answers that because the other earth exists every movement event and thing said is duplicated as it's happening on both worlds because of that given and the sun in between the two versions of the same person in this case glenn ross astronaut can never meet a complete accident discovered the planet in the first place when it would have most likely stayed a secret forever br br filmed mostly in portugal with fx work in england it's a must own for any gerry anderson fan i have the image bare bones dvd from a few years ago now out of print but one hopes universal will re release it with perhaps extras and even a gerry anderson commentary
<START> don wilson stars as a cop who enjoys the occasional virtual reality fighting game however things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people from the video game okay actually they make the models as prototype but the main bad guy from the video game awakens and starts killing people and now the only man who can beat the guy is don wilson who in the mean time falls in love with the model actually with all things considered my biggest confusion was trying to understand if the people brought over from virtual reality land were robots human cyborgs or just some type of unidentified computer program it doesn't matter since this is all just an excuse to watch one of the worst actors ever butcher dialog as if he were running a deli don wilson's complete lack of charisma is the film's biggest flaw since one just doesn't like the guy he's too goody goody his voice is too high pitched and doesn't look very impressive in the action sequences what saves this bore fest from my lowest rating is massey who looks super hot in high cut outfits and who gets occasionally naked also on board is loren a good martial artist stella stevens and michael dorn as the main voice of the bad guy but their efforts are in vain as they are all concealed by the very bad acting of wilson another flaw which is the film's biggest mistake is a lack of action as we are asked to watch the story unfold but aside from massey's nudity and maybe some unintentional amusements due to laughably unconvincing acting there really is nothing of interest this also extends to the action sequences in which are flatly choreographed badly directed and completely drained of all possible excitement making this virtually unwatchable br br out of 4 bad
<START> how can anybody give this anything higher than a '1' br br i thought manos the hands of fate would forever be the worst movie ever to itself upon my optic nerve indeed i didn't think anything could be worse br br i was wrong galaxina is that rare movie where every single element of it is achingly agonizingly blindingly bad how often have you watched a movie and commented who the hell lit this thing from lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to well everything this movie is absolutely unendurable it's so bad i couldn't even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama i'd ever seen br br it's too bad even to be laughable i'd sooner eat a of broken glass than sit through it again
<START> like an earlier i saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story splendid acting and dramatic musical score it certainly contains some of sam finest work he and the writers depict oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero which he was but also as naive fond of alcohol and snobbish a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype
<START> usa's azn tv purchased the rights to this film and the network is showing it using the english title the pickpocket br br 1997's the pickpocket takes amateur home movie style movie making to amazing levels of unpleasantness the movie depicts a long winded series of boring wanderings of an uninteresting confused guy this lead character xiao wu does not simply walk about aimlessly viewers will unfortunately soon realize that xiao wu has an unsurpassed talent to seek out and remain dormant near the most obnoxious noises to be found in china clanging empty tin buckets being beaten with a stick he is there every old motor in china clunking in agony he is there a crying baby yes you guessed it he is there according to the pickpocket china is the most irritating unpleasant sounding place on planet earth br br the only element worse than the sound of the pickpocket is the photography the camera shakes shakes and shakes some more finally the camera stills but then it falls to the actor's knees and just stays there until someone in the crew realizes the mistake and begins to shake the camera again most of the shaky film is framed in distant long long long shots the few times when the camera gets somewhat close nothing compelling ever takes place to connect the viewer with what is happening br br the photography is murky faded and often blurry the use of color is well there is no sign of intelligence controlling the use of color most every shot is held 20 times too long few movies are so painful to sit through this film is painful to watch and painful to hear and then it simply ends br br john woo fans might enjoy being able to hear part of the soundtrack to die xiong the killer as the lead character is hanging outside of a video store for many minutes anyway be warned the pickpocket will steal away your good time
<START> this is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party i go to it is clear from the start that steve was taking this role seriously the other principles were walking through their lines i think they got a whiff of how much it stank early on and they were going through the motions for their paychecks sean bean acted as usual but was spared sharing space on screen with any of the principles till the final scene where it was like an actor walking onto a high school stage that is how defined the contrast was some actors do not look good scruffy some actors should not bulk up for a part those two statements apply to police academy steve his scruffy look translates to bum and indigent and his up makes him look potato lumpy not buff pair that with one of the worst scripted dialogues in hollywood history and you have bad movie i can only guess that all of the principles really really needed the money for or something or their agents signed them before the script was written by the monkeys that must of typed it out i would love to know the back story to this disaster
<START> i saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it the music and scenery are beautiful i purchased the vhs tape a few years ago and watch it frequently i would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older elton john music
<START> this is first of all a good exciting story with well developed characters but all the other details are well crafted on top of that leading to a wonderful film don't let the disney label lead you to think this is dumbed down or only for kids it has a lot to offer to all ages whether you like golf or not one of the more impressive things is that the film manages to make a golf game look really exciting and speaking as one of many who can't abide golf on tv this is no small feat br br the first half of the film does a good job of laying out the basic characters with their motivations and backgrounds enough that you end up liking all the important competitors once the pivotal match begins halfway through sure you root for character all along but his primary opponents are likable and interesting in their own right the background layer is important once the golf match becomes a match using minds as well as golf clubs since you get a good understanding for what each person's strengths and weaknesses are as the play progresses br br the computer effects are flashy but they do help the story more often than not the directing has all sorts of clever golf shots and the period costumes and sets are really top notch br br there are a few small quibbles many of the minor characters seem a little too stereotypically cast from the class warfare mold but this is forgivable with the major characters so well drawn br br shia playing francis is as usual callow and sympathetic but the real standout is steven playing harry he rarely moves his face but his intense often sad eyes and minor changes of expression say so much br br caddy eddie lowery played by josh flitter steals the scenes he is in after you see the film google to find the actual photograph of and lowery at the tournament to get an even better appreciation of how incredible this match truly was
