<START> fat girls is among the worst films within the indie gay genre br br the premise is promising an average looking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small tx town his only kindred spirits are the other village hs misfits the class 'fat girl' a naÃ¯ve immigrant from cuba and the sensitive drama teacher so far interesting in theory this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built in audience the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across america and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand peppered with a dose of self deprecating humor br br unfortunately rather than a nuanced dramedy ash christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor the result is a cast of unlikeable derivative two dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward sabrina fink is a quasi goth bitter navel she is such a prickly unsympathetic person there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition the chemistry between her and rodney christian registers zero this may have been bad casting but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply consequently one is left wondering when there is such a non existent bond what could possibly warrant their near constant companionship throughout the story br br sabrina's newfound boyfriend rudy de jesus and rodney's mother judy are among the most exaggerated of the clichÃ©d stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films rudy is the horny immigrant nerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent comedy ever made within the realm of tv or film judy is the born again obsessed with jesus talk and big hair just when you thought the tammy faye thing had been done to death christian inserts a scene where judy's mascara is running with her tears is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years br br in addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor there are many puzzling story inconsistencies rodney considers himself a fat ugly loser however he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jock hunk ted miller although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment most gay teens filled with raging testosterone just like their hetero brethren would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy br br rodney finds an object for his affection in bobby an exotic transplant from england against all believable odds the lad not only happens to land in this tiny tx hamlet but is conveniently openly gay to boot like sabrina bobby is an icy angry smart aleck and the viewer is left head scratching as to his magnetic appeal br br much to his delight rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar where bobby claims to be the dj upon arrival the boyfriend to be promptly leaves rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man this is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since rodney's feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town as tiny as the town is they have openly gay students at the high school a secretly bisexual football captain lesbian moms a gay teacher and it has a gay bar downtown by attractive men no less apparently the place is not so backwater after all br br ten years earlier todd edge of seventeen covered nearly the same material with a much more creative honest touching and humorous film
<START> i saw this movie when i was very young it is my all time favorite i had been unable to obtain a copy until recently and viewing it brought back so many fond memories i loved sidney portrayal of he his character with such strength and courage pearl bailey's part although small was not unlike many of our own family members my favorite songs were and still are bess you is my women don't let him handle me and of course summertime according to the guidelines if i'm interpreting them correctly i'm unable to post where i was able to obtain my copy sorry that is why i registered so that i might be able to share this info before registering the guidelines are not posted br br phone numbers mail addresses availability price or ordering shipping information
<START> like the above poster i got burned on the title thinking i was getting the other piranha this movie is everything the above poster said and worse br br poor camera lousy acting and just plain horrid storyline br br there was very little here that was even worth watching how this movie even got released is beyond me br br make sure the movie you buy is the one you want and not this one br br the movie i bought was labeled piranha and not piranha piranha which is what it actually is this is the only way they sold this movie at all br br peace out
<START> this is a very enjoyable fluffy glamorous musical from the 40's girl' made rita hayworth formerly the dark haired latin senorita margarita into a bona fide all american star it confirmed gene kelly's amazing talent as a dancer singer actor and choreographer it epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre br br rita hayworth is great as rusty parker it is her picture and her presence is always at the forefront her singing is dubbed but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with kelly i think that rita was highly underrated as an actress she plays every scene superbly here gene choreographed the dance sequences he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here and his ego' dance number is amazing such artistry the stand out tunes are 'make way for tomorrow' 'put me to the and of course 'long ago and far away' the plot is rather thin yet it does have a moral it's about the perils of quick fame and fast money and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed this will cheer you up lift you up to your feet and make you laugh br br that said girl' is not the greatest musical ever produced it has a number of flaws that must be addressed one can say that a little bit of phil silvers goes a long way his character gets tedious rather quickly however i was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with gene and rita another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great the girl' number looks fantastic but i'm not a fan of the lyrics or the singing tom' is a huge downer i think it's one of the worst numbers i've heard in a 40's 50's musical yet it stinks the grandmother sub plot borders on being ridiculous but that's only my opinion others may like these elements br br still apart from it's faults it's a very very good film much better than most of the product churned out today the dancing and singing is sublime the production values are excellent and it's mood is infectious br br 8 10
<START> john leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller every time this has been on hbo i've had to stop and watch it john tells the story of how he grew up probably some fact and fiction and adds hilarious stories in the midst if you like john's comedy i would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best
<START> i am fifteen years old and have seen thirty three of sinatra's films not counting videos of tv shows and documentaries and have been unimpressed by only two of them the clouds roll by and the miracle of the bells don't really count however considering that in the first all he does is sing a magnificent ol' man river and in the latter he's not half bad only the picture is pathetic my favorite records radio shows tv shows and movies concerning sinatra change virtually every day everything taking on a different connotation at each viewing and occasionally seeming the best thing he ever did and occasionally the worst until the cycle comes around again but there are a couple things that are beyond comparison when it comes to movies the man with the golden arm heads that list everybody who knows anything about sinatra knows he thought this was his best ever performance he was oscar nominated it was the first serious look at drug addiction etc etc the jazz score is unforgettable kim novak's likable despite a ludicrous accent eleanor parker is annoying and waaaay too dramatic the turtle like arnold is amusing the first time but more embarrassing every time out and darren mcgavin makes a wonderfully slimy drug dealer the sets are unconvincing at first glance it seems a peculiar mixed bag tossed together by the great otto preminger with an off center charm br br then you come to sinatra like everything else in his life other than music reports of his acting are alway divided in half directors like fred zinnemann frank capra billy wilder stanley kramer martin scorsese peter bogdanovich and otto preminger all agreed that had sinatra worked as hard on his films as he did on singing he'd have been among the greatest actors in the world if not the greatest humphrey bogart even said this guy has the most natural acting talent i've ever seen not bad for a man who never took an acting lesson in his life was at the same time producing the discography that would make him the greatest singer of the 20th century and did almost all his scenes in one take br br in direct conflict with all of this are those other reviews and biographies that sniff haughtily about what a lousy actor was this mr sinatra and how many bad movies he made the question will never be answered to everyone's satisfaction because controversy was among sinatra's greatest assets and both arguments were in a sense playing into his hand in any case at this time in this role sinatra is magnificent a reviewer said in the late fifties sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world but there is none more fascinating to watch no matter what sinatra is doing in a film it's hard to take your eyes off him this of course is a charisma that i've only seen in a handful of other people orson welles richard burton marlon brando montgomery clift perhaps james cagney there's no real definition for it and it often makes it hard to figure out whether you're really enjoying a performance or just spellbound but that quality on display here is what makes the movie sinatra is downright riveting real intense transcending decades and thousands of paper doll pop stars with something called quality like it or not this is a one man show with a few character actors hanging around in the background he covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety from sweet lonely tenderness with kim novak to the terrifying shock of frank sinatra frank sinatra whimpering and screaming in the agony of cold turkey sinatra was right this is his best performance no question br br i was eight when frank sinatra died i wasn't around for all the years of bobby soxers and aweigh '' mr ava gardner and here to eternity albums with lamp posts and lovers kennedy vegas ring a ding ding basie and mia and reagan and concerts from madison square garden to south africa to the white house to the sands i can't say i like sinatra because i heard him at the paramount or because i hear september of my years the usual excuses and my excuse when i was eleven i watched a movie called on the town
<START> i saw this movie years ago and i never forgot it the theme is very timely it was on tcm this morning and i am wondering why this wonderful film is not on vhs or dvd i have searched extensively for this movie but cannot find it i believe that if enough people request it the movie will ultimately be put on dvd it amazes me that such a stunning performance from quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public the fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must see for teachers and students alike this film is a great teaching tool from the past yet in many ways as contemporary as crash from previous comments i can see that this film as made deep impressions on everyone again too bad it is not available for sale
<START> begotten the magic the terror the slight boredom br br that begotten is for acquired tastes goes without saying you don't just happen to watch it unless your friends are real art house movie buffs you must dig the weird the macabre the bizarre you must dig cool flicks and you must dig to find diamonds br br begotten is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films ever known to man the visual part is something to behold something no one can prepare you for but since the film is devoid of any type of dialogue the visual part is pretty much the only part begotten is a visual film the created for the film are magical and groundbreaking but still the sight of it br br god commits suicide in a particularly gory scene then from his corpse rises mother earth who impregnates herself with god's semen and gives birth to flesh on bone a retarded child she then abandons him and he gets tortured by heathen like creatures mother comes back to save him but she and her son get murdered by the horrible creatures br br the film is about the meaninglessness of life and about the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and to die and that when something dies something else is born etc nihilism br br the film's no 1 quality is of course the visuals the setting those haunting images this other worldly quality after you're done watching you feel like an alien it's that mesmerizing br br when people say it should last instead of 70' they're right no they're not it could last it's just that everything happens to such a slow pace in fact the plot summary i provided is all that happens in the film like no kidding still it's i don't know glorious br br like a flame burning away the darkness
<START> are you kidding me the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog and the music was nothing great anyone know what jake's mother said when he walked in the door and the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in soho couldn't we have had a better line here was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over mixed way to loud music
<START> the claude lelouch's movie is a pretty good moment of cinema one of the most touching films about family and loneliness and surely the best interpretation of french actor jean paul belmondo
<START> after watching stop loss i find myself against disappointed in hollywood for making such a stinker gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an american fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home what we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid anti bush radicals the story tells of three young men who return home from the war one descends into out of control madness culminating in his death the main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war and destroys his best friends relationship with his fiancÃ© at the same time the third truly is the hero of the story electing to continue the fight that was brought to our shores nearly eight years ago what makes this movie bad is not the acting but the premise behind it we are lead to believe that decorated soldiers are in fact haters of our country desertion is akin to treason in a time of war and the main protagonist flirts with it throughout the movie this paradox is designed to weaken the audience's reaction to the central act of the movie we are not supposed to find fault with king since he wears medals but his actions don't just merit it but cry out for it he is not an anti hero in order to accept the movie the audience must accept the correctness of desertion because the story paints king as nothing else short of a hero i cannot accept that since it is like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day furthermore derision for the real hero is heaped upon the man who re enlists and continues to serve his country i would only recommend this stinker to someone who needs convincing of the decay of hollywood as it is a clear example of it no wonder it fared poorly in the box office
<START> the riddle was written and directed by brendan foley in what appears to be an attempt to pull the mysteries of the charles dickens' novels into a contemporary story but that attempt is thwarted by electing to use the two periods of time format in which the is unraveled despite a cast of well known actors trying their best to pull off this direct to dvd movie the end product is a long tedious amateurish mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast as remembered from other films br br mike sullivan vinnie jones is a journalist confined to reporting on dog racing events while he dreams of important reporting assignments a series of similar murders happens to include an old friend of mike's sadie vera day who runs a pub on the banks of the thames having just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by charles dickens and has a heart of gold giving sandwiches away to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp beachcomber derek jacobi sadie's murder attracts mike to the role of detective journalism and with the help of policewoman kate julie cox he begins to tie the investigation to clues he finds in reading the dickens manuscript disrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks to dickens' time as dickens again derek jacobi narrates a rather personal story of peculiar murders the parallel between stories and the cross casting among actors may have worked in another's hands but the finessing of this kind of venture escapes writer director brendan foley he draws his story to a close at long last with a tired ending br br in addition to jones jacobi cox and day the film somehow attracted the attention of vanessa redgrave jason flemyng ph moriarty and mel smith their contributions are minimal but happily distracting this is a flimsy bit of treacle leaving the viewer wondering how films of this quality ever find funding grady harp
<START> two wildlife photographers are traveling through the amazon river basin on their latest assignment while trying to capture the wildlife of the area on film our photographers cross paths with a game hunter who is stalking the animals for another reason looking to eliminate the witnesses to his illegal activities the hunter decides according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br handsome guide peter brown as jim takes pretty blonde capri as terry greene and her good looking brother tom as art greene into the venezuelan jungle to admire the view and take wildlife pictures after they hook up with hunky big game hunter william smith as psychological dramatics surface br br a pivotal scene with mr brown in the vee of a tree and sharing a cigarette with mr is nicely staged the circular direction reappears in the later fight between brown and mr smith and it is effective early sex romp adds nothing to the story it could have been cut to take advantage of what seems like flirting between the brown and characters an attraction between brown and ms capri could have been played up also br br the music including jim stein's love all things that love the sun is fine but the film needs to be re tracked to cut out animals which do not appear on screen and there is far too much superfluous footage on display piranha is a case where less would have been more
<START> yong ki puppet master only with scary parts was the most recent korean horror flick i had the pleasure of watching with the title of in asia this movie struck me immediately when i saw it reviewed online with images that made me think of puppet master childs play and other toy doll based horror flicks in the past but for some reason i didn't think boy this will be tacky i imagined it would be creepy and fun horror done well almost br br the movie starts slowly but i like that so it was fine the score almost like i found with was beautiful and very much reminded me of classic horror scores of the past i wont give much away but the story was strong in this one and i would highly recommend it to any fan of asian horror it isn't extreme it isn't to be taken with utmost seriousness but it is really good
