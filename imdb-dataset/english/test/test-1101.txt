<START> i went to see this film over matchstick men in fact buying the tickets to matchstick men and going to the other because it looked like a fun movie with action romance thrills jungles and exotic locations they had all that but so do a lot of movies with a conception of story br br all i can say is why why why why did they not just make it a straight narrative instead of some sappy flashback story br br here is all the movies from what i've seen the film was derived from of course indiana jones and romancing the stone but also true lies proof of life that old 80s tom selleck movie bananas woody allen and hero from the use of digital extras br br ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up
<START> the bearings of western style feminism on the various of india have hitherto remained largely non existent the two entities belonging to alien realms and threatening in the name of tradition never to coincide art imitates life or so the claim goes and popular hindi cinema is no exception reflecting an underlying misogyny which regrettably forms the foundation of much of the collective indian culture but why what is it about the female gender that has rendered it so hateful to the culture that women are routinely subject to the most unimaginable horrors including rape murder infanticide imposed illiteracy infidelity and the subjugation of spirit that goes under the name of rajkumar santoshi's latest offering lajja asks the same plaintive question linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters episodes which comprise the journey of shame endured by its protagonist br br direction on santoshi's part is not up to par with the level the story demands he fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity in depicting the saga of sadness and confronts the issue of misogyny from the side instead of head on santoshi has recently said that he did not make the film for an international film festival but rather for the masses of his country regrettably the tackiness shows and the film too often delves into the action blood gore genre that santoshi specializes in the film suffers from its jerky episodic pace and its ending is rather too contrived br br the female cast is given much kinder and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts the protagonist is played sensitively by the beautiful who proves in lajja that she is one of our time's more competent leading ladies and given a proper role and set up emerges with a truly commendable performance one wonders how brilliantly she may have shone had the film been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the issue at hand puts in a laudable performance and continues to show that she is an untapped talent cast as madhuri dixit performs with a never before seen fervor and felicity for what truly deserves the name of 'acting ' the role of a street smart performer who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the greatest risk in her cannon of song n dance roles which have maintained her marquee status over the past decade which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this would be feminist saga that of the ceaselessly talented rekha lajja is film there can be no doubt about that but it is rekha who dominates the proceedings in a performance that digs into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the of your heart rekha dazzles as foregoing vanity and complacency to deliver a performance that is so replete with authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this portion of the film comparisons are indeed odious especially when rendered opposite one of the world's great leading ladies but in the gracious presence of this reigning screen legend the others fade in her shadow br br lajja has none of the sophistication of proto feminist dramas like zubeidaa pinjar or even the hell queen celebration it fulfills its feministic goals in two early moments the loud tirade in which berates her in laws for their abuse of her father who has committed no other crime than given birth to a girl she erupts leaving the wedding procession in shambles seeing her father devastated she begins to weep blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her she bemoans why did i say anything i have ruined everything it is all my fault her grandmother witnessing silently the abuse she bore comforts her by saying why are you crying there is no reason for you to be crying you are not at fault for anything the fault is mine the fault is of every woman who came before you because if we had had the courage to say in our day what you have said today there would have been no need for you to say anything today in this scene the importance of the feminist legacy is laid plainly in sight through words br br the other more subtle moment comes very early in the film when has fled from her abusive husband to the refuge of her parents' home in india to viewers of western societies it may seem perfectly reasonable indeed natural that any abused woman would seek the protective of her parents this however is a societal taboo in many eastern cultures india among them once a woman has been married the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets family business children etc for her to turn her back on these responsibilities is a grave social sin one which truly has no equivalent for the western woman she is thereafter regarded as tainted and as one whose value has been nullified entirely by her own actions and her refusal to submit to the role she has been given she is not so much an individual as she is an emblem of familial honor her father rebukes her for her actions concerned that his familial honor will be tarnished irreparably by the daughter he had already transferred to another man his primary concern is that of the impending marriage of younger sister a prospect made far less likely with a divorced elder daughter in the same household he tells her in no uncertain that she must return to the man to whom she belongs however violent and sadistic he may be he against her the age old adage that the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter quietly and pensively she replies yes the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter but there is no honor for the daughter herself
<START> anyone who has seen ali g before should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is g br br although i prefer ali g when he is interviewing the rich and famous his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too br br ridiculous plot ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script that all make this film a riot for fans of ali g br br if you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague because it's definitely just more of the same for everybody else watch it 7 10
<START> i found this movie to be one of the best for this time and era the cast was very exceptional and most entertaining to all that saw it i would like for my younger generation to have seen this movie but i haven't been able to find or see the movie in the past my first viewing was back in the early sixties and i have been looking for it every since the movie showed me potential of how far we come go to become a gifted at a craft where we could only have meaningless roles to act as buffoons and servants br br porky and bess showed some of the urban life of my neighborhood as i saw it in the time where i needed good solid male role models the singing and acting had me skipping for days playing the part of different characters in this excellent movie
<START> this is just art house rubbish i sat watching this trash with my bosnian friends they found it as boring as i did for a more interesting and more true account watch the excellent movie saviour this is just a snoozefest with people talking in coffee shops a cure for insomnia 1 out of 10
<START> this has been one of the best vampire movies that i have seen in a long time it was very seductive and alluring i liked that it did not have the usual gore and carnage that comes along with most vampire movies the music was excellent it would be great if there was a sequel
<START> from the beginning 'til there was you was on the right track setting up for the big finish where it would all come together but the thing is it didn 't i found the ending extremely disappointing but maybe in someway it was the right ending a little more realistic you could say judge for yourself
<START> i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free thank god had i paid for it my review would be less forgiving br br well the major idea of the film geeky girl takes bloody revenge isn't all that original there are several parallels to carrie playing a mean practical joke on a loser except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her and carries bad family background i still think it's a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didn't take much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong things br br what worked i liked the actress that played tamara she looked great when she was hot and her catty lines were fun sean can't come to the phone he's f king patrick br br what didn't work the whole thing was silly i generally prefer rational explanations she could have the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge there were a lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue please br br the whole idea wasn't bound for oscar buzz but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had it was bearable but far from good
<START> i heard that after the first oceans movie the sequels begin to go downhill i believe that this is not the case at least not for this film this movie is even better than the first film the original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed terry casinos now benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks to do that they must do a couple heists in europe to get the money br br the acting is very good the all star cast exceeded expectations matt damon brad pitt and catherine zeta jones were probably the best in this film br br there are some confusing moments in this film but that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments anyway this movie is only made for harmless fun br br overall this is a great heist movie i rate this movie 9 10
<START> i highly reccommend this movie it blurs the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a seamless fashion that it has to be seen to be believed the actors and director have such perfect timing that in one scene a name calling fight becomes a sort of dance i loved the story line the actors everything while i do think there were one or two decidedly cheesy scenes over all the movie was impeccably done
<START> if you don't like italian horror you won't like this film on that note br br overall it was a terrible experience many things happened vanessa redgrave was scheduled to be in the film and she pulled out one of the actors was crushed by a car i was engaged to be married but by the end of the picture that was finished my father died during the shooting all kinds of things dario argento on the making of opera br br i was truly impressed with argento and the film he made here especially against such harrowing circumstances the whole mystique of macbeth and its curse on those who attempt to stage the play adds untold volumes to opera br br throughout the film argento some of his most clever and audience directed tricks a young opera singer christina is stalked by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders by taping several sharp blades to eyelids the killer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes take a good look if you try to close your eyes you'll tear them apart so you'll just have to watch everything br br it is clear that argento put great care into constructing the faux macbeth opera on screen and his hard work pays off add to this several unforgettably brutal murders an incredibly tense chase sequence and the genius use of pov to portray a certain character the role vanessa redgrave pulled out on thank god and you've got one of the best italian horror films ever created br br that said it's still italian horror why christina never seems to tell anyone about this brutal murders is beyond anyone's comprehension some scenes might be difficult for certain viewers to stomach but personally i felt more tension towards christina and her eyes than any of the brutal slayings in the film the finale to had my stomach churning more than anything in opera but that's probably just me br br and the last five minutes argento wanted it he filmed it and he's fought to keep it in the film absolutely no one likes it myself included but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the film for me it remains one of argento's best films to date br br 9 10
<START> what a disappointment the story line is so simple the good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things dressed up into a racial setting to make it seem clever sophisticated and meaningful it isn't it lacks any subtlety br br everything that happens is telegraphed and then gone over again in case you missed the explanation br br for a film like this to convince and move the audience it has to be represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions not simply present it as a series of 180 degree changes in each character's actions br br half way through i really wanted to waste no more time on it but i thought i would stick with it in case it improved big mistake i should have stopped then it simply got worse
<START> i found this to be an underrated quietly compelling spaghetti western also known as dead or alive despite modest credentials apart from multi purpose co writer producer albert band the only notable crew member is composer carlo the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three american stars newcomer alex cord is an ambiguous anti hero while veterans arthur kennedy and robert ryan lend a mythic quality to the proceedings as well as the unusual plot involving a crippled protagonist an amnesty ruse covering a strategic clean up of the town and which has the law finally siding with the gunfighter against a horde of mexican bandits br br there are several tough action scenes on hand Â the film is capped by a terrific climax in which the star trio is besieged inside a blazing cabin Â plus a couple of outrageous moments which are something of a spaghetti western trademark from the middle of the street cord sees a hidden gunman at a window reflected in a whiskey bottle a man who helps cord escape is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains machiavelli also makes a nice impression as a village girl with whom cord the supporting cast then is peppered with familiar if largely anonymous faces Â all of them essentially genre fixtures br br i wasn't aware of the fact that the english dubbed version of the film on mgm r1 dvd was cut i was fooled by the wrong running time being listed on the back cover the film was only 99 minutes long and not Â apparently character is killed in the longer italian version
<START> i watched this movie the other night and i have to admit it was quite possibly the best film of this generation turns out i wasn't born until 1988 but i can relate to this motion picture like cary grant can relate to having an std or burt reynolds to being a burnout marky mark did not decline in awesomeness after his brief stint in new kids on the block which i will from here on refer to as the best band in the world aka like it's totally a morality tale about trannies an' poop so pay attention i love all y'all and continue to support marky because he needs us now more than ever he's the only who survived the de
<START> excellent movie about a big media firm and the goings on both on and off camera covering several years the film centers on 3 upwardly mobile young hopefuls all striving for their place within the corporation well written dialogue flawless acting and a riveting story made for 2 hours of solid entertainment
