<START> in august days dies marc has given us a sun saturated catalan documentary style road movie that's mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead the beautiful sometimes large scale richly atmospheric 35 mm landscape images nice soundtrack and catalan language narration are enchanting as a mood piece if one is content with a trajectory that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular filmmaker marc and his non identical twin david are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister marc had been researching the life of ramon 1940 2001 a socialist editor who had been a family friend he felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break the break turned into making this film which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with associates thoughts about the spanish civil war the drought season they were experiencing the rugged landscape the brothers' affection for each other swims and nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van this leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers in the end david has to go back to barcelona to be with his daughter and marc has to return to his project and there it ends i found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the catalan language with its blend of spanish and french sounding words perhaps linked with this isn't a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought provoking way br br an official selection of the 2006 new york film festival at lincoln center
<START> if you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause and that's just what director anthony asquith provided the british with naval war film we dive at dawn after more than 60 years it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated it doesn't help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring here as in so many other british war films the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an educated that would place them at home in england's finest ruling class establishments in this movie freddie taylor john mills the captain of the submarine sea tiger is clever confident resourceful aggressive in control good with his men humorous with his peers quick to make a decision and it helps that he's lucky his men are jolly for the most part competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while they're on leave after that things get tense quickly br br taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the a new german battleship they just miss the ship when it enters the kiel canal and heads into the baltic taylor the risks and decides the sea tiger will go after it through mine fields anti sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base after several tense situations the confrontation takes place the sea tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive not knowing if it had done its job after a clever subterfuge taylor a couple of german destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel he plans to scuttle his sub and surrender when just at the last moment james hobson eric portman a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who speaks german says there is a small danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot he thinks it might still be for the germans the last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the sea tiger back to britain this is a wartime propaganda movie so don't expect failure and did the sea tiger actually put the down are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts did hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once did freddie taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book you'll have to see the movie br br there are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies some like powell's and pressburger's one of our aircraft is missing and the 49th parallel still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichÃ©s others like we dive at dawn were made with enough clichÃ©s that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made still asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichÃ©s the sea tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense the stalking of the and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic john mill's no nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well handled the fake out preparations to make the sea tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic inside the sub as well as out as you could hope for and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting we dive at dawn is not a classic war film but it's a well made well acted example of its type and time br br john mills it's worth noting had a long long career especially in the fifties he played in a number of serious minded films looking back at those wwii days he had the quality of showing grit cheerfulness and perseverance but of also being trustworthy a man england could be proud of as he fought the war top billed in this movie was eric portman a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff upper lip mode but portman manages some complexity for his character mills and portman did fine jobs working together on this film
<START> i didn't read the book scarlett and when i watched this mini series i enjoyed it very much and thought it didn't need to be compared to gwtw the story may differ from the book but who cares its a movie even in the credits its based on the book its not the book the film is clearly under appreciated with the reviews that other people write but can't even spell the main characters names right br br the acting in scarlett i thought was superb joanne whalley and timothy dalton were excellent they took the characters and gave them there touch now as far as other people go by they compare them to the great vivian leigh and clark gable they obviously did fantastic but the leads in this film are completely different people who have there own acting methods and shouldn't be pressured of what people have to say if you wanted certain actors to do well then you should have directed the film i'm sure that other actors would not do as well as these with the chemistry and cleverness they brought to these roles the supporting cast stood out with there grandness and jean smart steals the scenes that shes in with her comedy genius br br the locations in the film were very beautiful and it was just grand to see scarlett go to all those places in the film as she causes trouble and other things also the scene in which scarlett talks to her dad's grave it was very dramatic and i thought from then on that there were two great actresses who brought scarlett o'hara to life not just vivian leigh but also joanne whalley br br the film and the book may differ but you must not take to heart that this is a sequel to one of the best films ever made otherwise you will think that this has to be like gone with the wind and you will not like this film but this is an under rated classic that is unlike gwtw its its own movie also keep in mind that tomorrow is another day
<START> you know you've got a bad film when you hear that the soundtrack is performed completely on a single cheap synthesizer without any melody or sense of rhythm br br it's hard to see how anyone could take this film seriously even while giving it a bad review this film is way beneath 'bad' br br the continuity of this film is outrageously butchered in one fight scene we the hero wearing and turn a corner with two revolvers in his hand he doubles back only now he has two semi automatics in his hands he turns another corner and now he has an automatic rifle in his hands he chases down a hallway and comes out suddenly dressed in standard army fatigue jacket with a shotgun after which he exits the building with yet another automatic rifle or here's one for the books a bus slams into a car at high speed the car goes flying thrown by a gigantic explosion cut to the bus which is completely unscathed from the same explosion the narrative continuity suffers from an equally numbing sense of unreality the bad guys really want to kill the hero obviously but every time they knock him out or otherwise get him in a vulnerable position they suddenly decide they want him to live to see this huh one of the funnier moments of the film is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to see him then the bad guy decides he's not going to let the two meet after all and this despite the fact that the the villain the hero and his lawyer all know what's going on anyway so the hero writes a note to the lawyer and next we see the note being passed to the lawyer by another prisoner even though we never see the hero give it to him this lawyer btw has complete access to the offices of the in california including its confidential computer files huh well but it's a mindless action movie so the action scenes not bad surprisingly unfortunately they happen to be from about a dozen hong kong films made five or ten years previously the opening scene a shoot out in a junker garage actually has shots the composition of which are stolen directly from hard boiled so clearly so that it's a wonder john woo didn't sue for plagiarism br br other hong kong films stolen from include prison on fire island on fire burning paradise police story i ii and iii aka supercop i thought i recognized a couple sammo hung clips here as well in other words the actions scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are successful of action scenes from other films br br there's nothing one can do with this film unless one shoots smack and just needs a lot of visual stimuli that needn't be make any sense br br very funny film for all the wrong reasons
<START> why couldn't the end of the movie have been sean connery's men fighting the french instead of the germans ever since the french had occupied algeria in 1830 the tribes from morocco and those of algeria were making raids on the french military and civilian settlements this movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the french had seize the so his followers would not be raiding algeria and then his followers would have attacked the french to free him br br the movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the germans and the americans when the americans shoot the germans their guns even the pistols make loud noises create large bloody bullet wounds and their enemies are screaming after being shot when germans shoot at the americans their guns don't make large sounds do not create bloody wounds and their enemies make little or no sound after being shot br br in real life the american rifle was the worst rifle america had ever produce until the early version of the m 16 came along the was hard to maintain not reliable and the rifle bolt was always jamming the german was one of the world's finest rifles we were so impress by it during spanish american war that we made a copy of it and call it the springfield rifle br br finally the people of morocco must had a word for artillery since the french were using them in their raids against morocco i didn't like it when they made the feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the vocabulary instead the stated that the europeans had guns on wheels that make the ground shake
<START> having just borrowing the series one dvd collection from my somewhat obsessive brother i was expecting to get through the first couple of episodes and handing it back i have just found myself yelling at the screen for ending the first season on a cliff hanger a mere week later and i've watched the entire season where i found the time for this i have no idea br br this show is great it doesn't take itself too seriously it has likeable characters who are well acted and the special effects ignoring the odd tacky puppet here and there are special enough to give it that polished feel at first i didn't realise it was filmed mostly here and it seemed odd to hear so many aussie accents on a sci fi show it was most amusing for the main character john to land back in sydney midway through the first season br br i believe this show's biggest strength is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had they have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explain previous actions and the continue to john's conversations with slang in an amusing and unforced way on top of that having watched the entire voyager and next gen series i see little plot rip off so it has managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the entire first season i hope the rest of it is as good br br farscape is not like any other sci fi that i've enjoyed in the past i heard that the fourth season wasn't as good as the first three and i am now quite annoyed that they cancelled it before the 5th i hope that they revive this show with the same actors in either a movie or another series it would be a shame to leave so many plot lines unfinished as i imagine that with a show that's had so much thought put into it to have it axed without adequate warning will leave me feeling robbed br br gotta go now heading back to my brother's place to the 2nd season br br v
<START> considering the subject matter i thought that this film would at least be enjoyable if stopping somewhat short of a masterpiece i was wrong i was still waiting for something to happen and it finished i thought that the finale was the bit that happened before it got exciting the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition
<START> this two and a half hour long film was shown recently at carnegie mellon university at a 10 pm show there was a scheduled 1 am show after that but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until 3 30 am the opening scene is of a man walking in a field and it lasts four minutes of movie time it is an ominous sign of what's to come a good minutes more of pretty much the same there is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall standing in the sun it is repeated 15 times with very sparse dialogue occasionally these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills such as a close up of female genitalia shown for one full minute of film time audience crowd laughing in the last 20 seconds as to say what's the message the story resembles dostoyevsky's novel the karamazov brothers in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals in one of the rare instants in which the crowd was laughing more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening was when the statement by a british tourist that he couldn't see things clearly since the train was traveling at 180 miles an hour was translated by the translator with automatic switch of units of measure from english system to metric system to they couldn't see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 kilometers per hour what was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that alot of money has been spent on it this was no film kitchen 8 mm experiment it was carefully planned structured acted montaged yet i got so little out of it some comments on the excruciating detail such as the of a key chain on a door just opened okay it was noted but what was the purpose some people in the audience walked away after the first hour the rest remained out of curiosity there must be something happening at the end there never was and maybe that's what the film is about all the movies at the theater are action packed this one wants to be different there is nothing happening
<START> i love this film there is something for everyone it if funny saddening passionate and dramatic the mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer cannot help but want to be a part of i must admit that i am slightly biased as colin firth is my favourite actor and so nothing that he does is wrong in my eyes but in this film his tremendous acting talent is apparent and it is furthered even more by the beautiful acting of his co star long the problems that their love affair suffers makes it ironically more believable and the simple features like the contrast between the colours of matthew's and clothes alone makes this film all the more enchanting i defy anyone that cannot be moved by this story i find it enchanting and have watched it at least ten times since i bought the film a week ago
<START> frankly i just enjoy watching james caan wonderful actor with such simplicity you know exactly what he's thinking a true pro br br i have watched the show from the very beginning and found it different that's something that is unique in hollywood a new idea not a 3rd version of a current hit show br br i also find the show fun and exciting i like the pacing you're never bored i especially like the mystery in each episode the way it unfolds i am a big mystery fan and have read a lot of the great mysteries but i find the stories in the show well written and the outcome is rarely obvious also extremely interesting to me probably because i am not a gambler is the different cons that the come up with i was fascinated by the number of schemes that people have come up with to rob las vegas the music i like the music at the top of the show absolutely perfect for the show sets the tone and atmosphere just marvelous and of course there is james caan
<START> finally got to see this movie last weekend what a disappointment it barely reaches made for tv level given the list of actors i would have expected something substantially more sophisticated the movie lacks a good story well actually any story for that matter it has no credibility instead lots of predictability save yourself the money and the time
<START> this is horrific no really this is bar none the absolute worst worst i hesitate to even call it a in' movie it is a ninety minute visual root canal the plot is practically non existent a mad scientist who looks like the frontman from 'the impregnates a woman in his secret lab a lawn chair in what i think may be a garage via an injection of within hours she births a full grown monster who then goes on a rampage thats the whole movie the death scenes these are poorly set up take forever and the acting how can you mess up screaming the victims stand there while the growling wheezing congested freak advances on them and proceeds to limply strangle them for about three days the sets are cheesy the lighting for most of the movie consists of a single yes a big honkin' flashlight the sound quality is poor theres only about 40 words of dialogue for the entire movie and the acting is generously described as wooden footage is shamelessly recycled to pad out the movie and the special effects would make any bbc sci fi production shake their head and proclaim they didn't even try the 'monster' is some nameless in a 3 halloween rubber mask with a few bandages slapped on in its encounter with the lone cop of the movie the cop fires invisible bullets that apparently travel so slow the monster can dodge them at five paces don't see this movie no really thats not a dare don't see this movie the director should be shot the writer should be chained to a giant rock where his liver will be devoured every morning by ed wood enough rentals and there could be a sequel don't let it happen
<START> this movie won a special award at cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why a few spoilers but for the ending you'll have to watch the movie a simple story in moscow on the eve of war between russia and germany in ww ii veronika tatiana is in love with boris aleksei but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army boris leaves for the front before veronika can tell him she loves him boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to veronika or his family mark boris' cousin rapes veronika who feels obligated to marry him degraded and demeaned by the cowardly mark veronika clings to the hope that someday boris will return superb camera work and wonderful set pieces by director for anyone interested in film technique another movie by i am cuba has at least two superb set pieces one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of havana rises two stories to a cigar factory tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long long avenue all without a cut superb acting particularly by and as boris' uncle that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement a devastatingly romantic movie with a heart stopping performance by this movie is frequently linked with the other russian classic ballad of a soldier
<START> this is better then the first the movie opens up with sheriff sam then sam and anne pack there bags up and head to the while jack tags along br br people are shot get glass through necks get squished by get stabbed with icicles eyes gouged out head explosions drownings hangings lobsters shoved into faces slit throats freezing to death killed by snowballs arms are ripped off melted by anti freeze icicles down necks hit in face with pots and pans fingers getting' bitten off icicles through mouths bitten on the neck exploding people toasted snowballs and shoved in br br the snowballs are hilarious they put it into a blender and turn it on then it says 'that was fun' they put in in a waffle thing and it gets burnt br br this is just a great movie then they start thinking of other ways to kill it and the snowball replies 'that's not nice' br br it was worth then ten bucks spent to buy this br br 10 out of 10 stars
<START> this noisy dizzying football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast well everyone except william h macy who could have tackled the role played by mr stone the team doctors or the fruitcake selling cereal if you're a fan of the foul mouthed there are some great profanity laden knock down drag out put down phrases you can try out on two faced friends and way ward lovers the film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere especially during the first two hours it even features some mtv styled music video scenes br br any given sunday 12 16 99 oliver stone al pacino cameron diaz jamie foxx dennis quaid
