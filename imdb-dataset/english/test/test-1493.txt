<START> jessica is a young virginal and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch jessica is also a powerful psychic capable of retro cognition and esp when young and handsome gordon hawthorne comes to visit he is instantly skeptical of jessica's powers until her skills uncover a lost wristwatch and unearth an ancient treasure chest however the treasure chest holds the severed head of a centuries dead satanist named gideon drew whose powers are far stronger than jessica's despite her warnings of the evil in their midst drew manages to mentally enslave everyone unfortunate to make eye contact with him but drew wants jessica most of all he needs her skills to unearth his body so that he can rise from the dead and rule over the human race will jessica's powerful de lis combined with gordon's love ward the ancient evil off before it can destroy them all br br this isn't a very interesting movie it certainly could have been the basic story is interesting and imaginative but the acting is leaden and the whole thing moves much too slowly to hold interest jessica is also too innocent almost annoyingly so and gordon her love interest is wooden stiff and totally emotionless none of the characters are very likable and the low budget is painfully obvious a rushed ending also doesn't help matters avoid unless it's the mst3k version
<START> the 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful film it is based on an absolutely charming book by charles kingsley it has a truly talented cast from the likes of james mason bernard and david not to mention the vocal talents of david jason and jon pertwee there is also lionel jeffries the director of wonderful classics such as the railway children and the amazing mr and while the film is good on the most part it was also a little disappointing i had no problem with the performances particularly those of mason and as and sir john harriet respectively and tommy and samantha gates are believable as tom and ellie the voice cast is also commendable especially jon pertwee voicing charming characters in their own right i also liked the incidental music it is so haunting and beautiful and the script was fairly faithful and in general well written particularly at the beginning the characters especially the water babies are very charming and the villains are sinister and funny at the same time i loved the part when tom and his friends help the water babies escape seeing the shark chasing the electric eel with an axe was very funny however i will say the film does look dated especially the animation sequences the live action parts weren't so bad if you forgive the rather dark camera work the character animation was rather flat and the backgrounds sometimes were a little dull though there were some nice moments like the scene with the and of course the first meeting with the water babies i also had mixed feelings about the songs the water song was beautiful but i found the first song forgettable when tom ends up underwater hi is an example of a song that is like marmite you either love it or hate it i personally don't know what to make of this song it was fun to listen to at first but once it's in your head it is perhaps annoying as much as i like lionel jeffries and his films his direction just lacked the wonder and the magic it usually does all in all certainly not a terrible film but could have been better artistically 7 10 bethany cox
<START> whether you're a fan of the series which inspired it or not there's no denying this is a patchy piece of work but in the best possible sense keen to get away from the trappings of old sitcoms which made an uneasy transition to the big screen messrs pemberton dyson and gatiss have gone down a different road addressing the problems of dealing with their success along with adding other creations and inevitably rehashing some of their best loved characters it's a pity they didn't stick to just a more consistent league of gents movie because as inventive as including themselves in the screenplay is it weakens the finished movie well worth renting though
<START> for comedy to work there are many factors involved br br 1 don't be afraid to take risks 2 if anyone or anything deserves to be poked fun at do it and continue to do it br br but most of all br br 3 be funny br br the war on everything succeeds in all those three things in fact the show proved to be so popular and so funny that already only months after it's first episode a dvd of the first season was released i picked it up within days of it being released and hit the floor laughing and had so many fu ing tears in my eyes it's that well good br br in short and to save me blabbing on about the show watch it buy it it whatever will make you watch the fu ing best show in the world br br go the chaser
<START> this film is one of the classics of cinema history it was not made to please modern audiences so some people nowadays may think it is creaky or stilted i found it to be absorbing throughout has exactly the right presence to play alexander just as he did when he played ivan ivan the terrible several years later the music was beautiful br br my one complaint was the poor soundtrack that was quite garbled although i only know a little russian it would have been nice to be able to pick out more words rather than having to rely almost 100 on the subtitles i was watching this on an old videotape from the library though perhaps by now a dvd version exists on which the sound has been enhanced i would like to know whether the actors were using archaic russian or even old church when they were speaking the subtitles were strangely worded and it's hard for me to tell whether this was to reflect an older manner of speaking or whether the subtitles were just somewhat poorly done
<START> the problem i have as a finn is that most of the actors in this movie are in every finnish movie i have a feeling that finland has only like five actors i think that if you're not from finland you really like this movie as a refreshing novelty br br this movie is about a dreadful chain of events that affects a few people quite harshly alcoholism cold climate and darkness may all be clichÃ©s but they're still very real in todays finnish society a lot of people in finland have depression especially during winter br br the tone of the movie is very melancholic i enjoyed it and directing was again very solid i liked this movie a lot only negative thing is that you see the same faces that you've seen over and over again
<START> we really liked this movie it wasn't trying to be outrageous controversial clever or profound it was just entertaining and was what it said on the box a charming romantic comedy every other brit film maker seems to want to change the world nice to see one that just concentrates on telling a good yarn with elegant style
<START> slasher movies started may be 30 to 35 years before this movie but believe me this one among those pearl that will stay longer after you turned of tv set especially if you are a person easily scared this is the movie for you for which you wouldn't have stomach to take it full even after so many years the movie hasn't lost its charm and thrill br br no blood no gore but the thrill will for sure chill your spine out the movie starts with the bang and it stay with the same pace till its end bgm is nerve cracking and i remember this was the one copied in many indian movies those days kings favorite no wonder why thats the only reason i wanted to see this and it didn't let me down don't turn off the lights coz you wont find enrique but may be a smiling doll sitting right behind you beware not for the lite hearted br br two thumps up and i am going with 8 out of 10 which is pretty low but still i preserve my ratings for dramas
<START> this movie is certainly worth a watch it's full of action it's also humorous you'll laugh until your stomach hurts if you watch this movie this movie also includes lots of hi tech things hence the name gen y i recommend you to watch the prequel of this movie which is gen x
<START> it beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly it is no understatement to call it far fetched how the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since jesus the obese sheriff played by hoyt axton looked like a refugee from the jerry springer show and i found the blonde female lead jennifer jason leigh rather plain we have an expression here in the u k done up as which suits her perfectly it wasn't all bad however i enjoyed it immensely when the end credits rolled and 'the end' came up was quite brilliant for this hotch potch of a t v movie which if it had been a cinematic release would have been put on video and in discount stores in no time at all
<START> i don't usually like to comment on the acting in a movie because it is the one thing that people who have agenda against a film will go after in this movie i will make an exception the acting in this film are below average all around i mean halfway into the film i wonder how the hell did the producer and or the director gets around casting such an ensemble of people who can't act even though the production value was good the ill written story just compounded on top of the bad performance of the actors and there is even a half hearted attempts to a twist to the ending of the movie which ends up quite confusing is all the spanish horror films this disappointing
<START> it's a good watch if u have time deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight and get into serious trouble they find themselves fighting some shadowy people and can't deal with very very disturbing portrayal of japan the arbitrariness of modern life some intense scenes but a bit of a potboiler br br the spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on english sub titles obviously i don't know japanese br br the only other japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre so can't really compare otherwise it compares better with most hollywood blockbusters for story plot and buildup br br
<START> spoilers the third and mercifully last of the aztec mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star besides the mummy actor ramon gay as dr eduardo was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on may 28 1960 still that didn't stop gay in him being edited into them from his previous films from being in a number of future mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death br br in robot vs the aztec mummy we have the once again mad scientist dr trying to get his hands on the mummy's golden and bracelet in order by having them deciphered to find the treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern mexico city over 500 years ago robot vs the aztec mummy is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous aztec mummy films that take up over half of the films running time br br after getting introduced to the movie's cast members some who have been killed in the previous aztec mummy films we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane dr also know as the bat dr who looks like a wild eyed and crazed orson wells is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost aztec treasure but now unlike in the two previous movies he was in creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world an idea he must have gotten from watching ed wood's 1955 atomic superman classic bride of the monster br br unable to handle the mummy in his two other encounters with it where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly dr had created a robot with a human cadaver stuffed in it to the job of doing in the mummy for him with he mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local mexico city cemetery dr has his robot man brake into the mummy's crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation br br spoilers the big built up to the aztec mummy robot man confrontation turns to be a big let down with the mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the tin man in less then 30 seconds together with its creator dr all this while both dr and his friend and assistant who came to the mummy's aid have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action now without the mad and off the wall dr annoying it the mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large like dr that it has really no interest in
<START> i have seen quite a few action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever there are very few films which i even consider watching several times and this is one of them everything in this movie is just right clint as the superb leading actor rene russo as his non stupid female partner this is a very rare combination sad but true of course john deserves a lot of praise for his excellent villain but let us not overlook eastwood s initial buddy played by dylan mcdermott who in my view fits the role perfectly the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic but sadly never released on an original soundtrack cd shame on the producers the plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between eastwood and i give this one 10 stars
<START> as a big fan of tiny toon adventures i loved this movie it was so funny it really captured how cartoons spent their summers
