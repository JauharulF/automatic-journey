<START> iron eagle has always been one of my films for a long time now it looks like but with a different plot and a lot of people will disagree with me here in my view it's better than br br this film has some amazing dogfight scenes when the fighter jets are zooming through the air it also has the queen song one vision thumping in the background which in my opinion is a fantastic song br br to be honest iron eagle was very good but it's sequels were rubbish br br
<START> first of all i'd like to say that i really enjoyed this movie however that said i can't say that it was a good movie i went into the theatre with pretty low expectations something i've learned to do i'm glad i did because the plot and development wasn't stellar the jokes were low grade humor but i was in the right mindset to enjoy them br br i wasn't the only one in fact the entire theatre was laughing out loud i didn't hear anyone complain after the movie came to a close i even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing but again i have to warn you grandma's boy is not a top quality film it is a funny albeit low brow movie and if you go with the right mindset you'll really enjoy it oh and don't take kids to it
<START> it really is a great film after being able to ignore blake edwards pink panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny julie is as usual wonderful singing and acting brilliantly i remember seeing it at the odeon cinema in the london on its release however julie's non appearance at the uk premiere of star was most unfortunate and apparently due to filming the aerial shots for darling lili over ireland a reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years but darling lili just like star deserves much more public appreciation
<START> a ham actor without a penny who better than michael caine to play such a character he is totally and utterly hilarious but as in most of caine's performances he goes for it for real the film seems to be a showcase of dylan moran and he's splendiferous in his double act with caine this however is where the script falters moran's impersonations should have been incorporated in a rather more organic way they are too much of an act on their own and makes the potential plausibility of the plot fly out of the window never mind get it if you can find it there is enough in it to make it a pleasurable journey
<START> nothing could be more appealing than the idea of a good love story featuring kristin scott thomas and harrison ford the cool refined english beauty and the warm blooded american male what could possibly be more lovely well this is not that movie right away they ruin it by casting kristin scott thomas as an american congresswoman that's like casting hugh grant as babe ruth or colin firth as al capone kristin scott thomas is exactly the sort of woman you don't picture shaking hands with greasy ex junkies in filthy slums or squeezing into smelly crowds and kissing babies she would have been far better cast as the english born widow of an aristocratic senator the kind who belongs to the hunt club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half lives br br then there's harrison ford as a regular guy cop certainly he's tough enough for the role but the idea that he's going to romance this stunning high society beauty is a bit hard to swallow why couldn't he have been say a tough but wealthy reform politician with blue collar roots who inherits late husband's senate seat the two of them are initially quite cool to each other but for sake kristin is cordial to him and he in return starts showing her some of the rawer side of life things her husband sheltered her from her political awakening coincides with the jolting passion of a newer more blue collar lover one who appreciates her polish and refinement far more than her aristocratic husband now that's a love story instead of that though you get a blank meaningless thriller where the action drags and nothing happens well there is one ghetto style drive by scene where harrison almost gets killed but it's so abrupt and unexplained it's really more like welcome comic relief br br the sky is always gray in this movie and our refined lovely kristin always looks a little chilled when she's supposed to be dreaming of passion she looks more like she's dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea she also looks a bit sleepy most of the time like she'd really rather be napping in the bed than screwing harrison ford br br all things considered i'd say you can't blame her
<START> the only reason i decided to view this film is because of the great acting talents of karen alyson haywood bad money '99 who is deeply involved with gary cole dave cry wolf '05 who is a great war hero and has all kinds of ways to make money and never seems to stop telling lies alyson and dave are trying to rebuild an old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions the relationship gets troublesome and alyson decides to find out what is going on and the plot gets very mysterious if you are a big fan of karen this is the film for you i only wish karen would appear in more films i miss her great talents
<START> this must be the most boring film i ever saw the only positive i can say about it is that thankfully i didn't pay to see it we were given a free showing in school and everyone in the audience just sat there embarrassed wondering when the fun would start this piece of junk is a badly filmed way too long film the actual idea on why making the movie took about 10 seconds to present the only ones who can be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why they might find some of the interviews interesting a different edit might have made an interesting documentary of this but i doubt it the interviews shown were not engaging in any way as it is it is just a tragedy both to behold and to be a part of avoid this film at any cost
<START> i can't help but forget that incredible scene in alien when the extra terrestrial burst out of one of the men's chest or even in predator when the invisible monster snuck upon the bewildered soldiers and cut them to pieces both these movies expressed fascinating ideas on the run of the mill creature feature back track to the era of cheesy b movies and watch big men in phony suits parading around killing people in small towns now recognize that the two movies above revolutionized this genre the cave does nothing to improve on it it tries nothing new and worst of all the cave doesn't even have good gore shame on them shame on them all br br parading around in sexy spandex are the one dimensional characters of the cave all of which seem to not care when they witness the death of their colleagues they just stroll along unbeknownst to the evil creature lurking in the darkness the plot is very easy to understand so you got the two brothers the black guy and the sexy female scientist the rest by the rest i mean all of those meet grisly demises are even more unexciting then the others we have the korean assistant the risky outdoor chick a russian scientist and two divers both lacking a sense of emotion and are stupid enough to wander off by themselves this movie exceeds to be extremely clichÃ©d since everybody but the black guy one of the brothers and the female scientist meet an end it also seems only americans can survive the terror since the russian and the korean die don't be offended if i give away details there's no real surprise anyway br br to be straight forward they find this cave they go in the cave they get stuck in the cave they start dying in the cave one of them gets infected in the cave more die in the cave they get out of the cave only to discover that one of them has a parasite that will turn them into a ghastly monster which really doesn't seem to bother them that's the simplicity of the lackluster plot it doesn't even try to be original it even has the part where they decide their leader isn't capable and split up we have just seen this way to many times before br br i know in a movie like this people don't care about the performances but it's worth mentioning how bad they were everyone is just so dreary cole hauser was especially unsophisticated and don't get me started on eddie who is frequently a lot better morris chestnut is hands down the best thing in the movie his performance is actually decent he portrays the guy who calms everybody down all the other actors are average at best in a show like this that's really not a bad thing br br now to the reason we go to this genre of film the action of course well to my regret the action was dull the death scenes are all boring hell the whole movie was there is barely any blood at all it's either they disappear and found later or they are attack and die without a bruise seeing the koreans man's death was the only exciting action i could find br br it's pretty amazing the bad things over shadow most of the things that are good a good example is to say the special effects were well done which they were the only thing wrong is that since everything takes place in a cave it's going to be dark i found it extremely hard to distinguish between the cave walls and the monsters so it was pretty hard to even see the creatures although i liked the special effects there was nothing original about the monsters they all resembled each other and they weren't frightening at all br br the cave marks the directorial debut for bruce hunt i don't see what he was trying to accomplish by making this film he obviously made a huge mistake almost everything about this movie stunk like a stink bomb a stink bomb is probably even more pleasurable than watching this mess again only the most forgiving moviegoer will find this forgivable i gave up all hope in the middle of the film when i heard the phrase what the hell was that for the third time
<START> as you can tell from the few comments posted here mine may very well be the last you'll see unless there is a big dvd release or tcm plays it again this is a kind of our gang movie with a bunch of different kids mgm certainly was the musical studio if the musicians dancers and singers weren't under contract they were on tap was one of the most expensive that does it for a little charity work the fee he received in that era was unheard of another musical film with jose iturbi mexican pianist featured about 100 kids playing some simple tune on 100 pianos so those skeptics who think young children aren't musical are mistaken i was one br br as all write frankie smith good ole american name gene reynolds was the bad but good kid who is taken in from the streets by the owners of a music school can you believe that walter brennan prof lawson of all those western movies was the man running the school joel mccrea peter mccarthy and andrea ann lawson were the bigger stars in they shall have music with a host of well known extras many of whom went on to become stars in their own rights as others have commented almost all of the kids in the orchestra actually the symphony from los angeles made big successes of their lives either as musicians for the studios and other businesses br br sad to say there aren't that many young people's orchestras today a sad mistake parents with children in school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above water and many don't even know what is happening to the kids in school musical instruction can get to be pricey and almost everyone would rather had a football team br br this is the cheapest concert by jascha you'll ever hear is contained in this movie in those days a quarter his playing is brilliant even if he looks like he'd rather be someplace else emotionless by contract any concert by yo yo ma is so joyful it makes you want to run right out and buy a cello this guy is having a good time like the kids in the street concert when they hoodwink to play at their school br br all of the orchestral numbers were played by the kids and they make it sound easy i love this type of movie their plots are so simple it doesn't take you two days to figure out if you enjoyed or understood the movie at all we need some new movies like this can't do anything but inspire younger kids to play other instruments than guitars bravo

<START> when i voted my 1 for this film i noticed that 75 people voted the same out of 146 total votes that means that half the people that voted for this film feel it's truly terrible i saw this not long ago at a film festival and i was really unimpressed by it's poor execution the cinematography is unwatchable the sound is bad the story is cut and pasted from many other movies and the acting is dreadful this movie is basically a poor rip off of three other films no wonder this was never released in the usa
<START> some films just fade away but tourist trap has withstood the test of time and has justifiably become a cult favorite though not completely original it owes much to the texas chainsaw massacre it holds its own with a sense of humor genuine creepy moments a brilliant score by pino donaggio and the fun performances by chuck connors and the cast don't let the pg rating keep you away this film proves that gratuitous gore and nudity are not needed in every horror film to make it entertaining those elements are usually used to cover the lack of thrills in a film here the scares are merited and effective plus only chuck connors could carry a scene in which he has to share soup with a mannequin a classic scene indeed now more accessible on dvd in widescreen this film is a must for fans of '70s horror fare
<START> when a killer calls is an unusually nasty slasher flick with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences the decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of when a stranger calls by pretty much putting in almost word for word the phone call sequences from that movie they seem very forced br br additionally the filmmaker commits the cardinal but all too common sin of having the heroine's friends being repulsive jerks so for the beginning of the film we really like and are rooting for the babysitter a nice believable job by but then she's joined by standard slasher flick teenage friends and the mood is ruined br br the flick sort of works but it probably a lot more unpleasant than you'll be expected so be fore warned
<START> i went to the cinema to watch a preview of this film without knowing anything about it recognizing jennifer lynch's name and seeing the 18 certificate i realised it might be disturbing in actuality i found the film a farce i found myself giggling in disbelief through parts of it the acting is atrocious bill pullman and his ridiculous twitching face i do almost pity the actors though as the script offers them no chance of any believable character interaction after some shocking incident there is plenty to try and shock the viewer in this film 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather everything was overstated or thought it was being clever when really it was obvious the performance from the little girl character named stephanie was the best thing about the film quiet and intense i really could not recommend this film to anyone its violent without point ridiculous characters bad acting bad script and plain silly
<START> true stories make the best stories don't they there's always something enjoyable about a story be it novel or movie or whatever simply by the fact that it's real makes the story all the more fascinating this movie is based on a true story of two young american men one a government employee and falcon boyce timothy hutton Âand the lee sean penn a drug dealer these two begin selling government mostly cia secrets in 1975 to the soviet union br br the film focuses on the human aspect of the two men as well as their growing personal problems especially penn's character with ever drug addictions rather than glorifying their status as traitors to america which would no doubt hurt the film's credibility in the us boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid as their dealings drag on and they dig ever deeper into treacherous territory becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened and more desperate to maintain control over a situation he has no control top of which he already has problems with the law the torment of boyce and families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds well to the idea that espionage against one's country even if thought to be done justly leads only to major problems and the ruination of the degradation of the friendship and trust between the two main characters br br here's the breakdown br br the good br br hutton and penn each did extensive research on the characters to capture their individual look and feel so they're portrayed with extensive depth and realism br br the acting is excellent br br the atmosphere of paranoia builds quite well br br the story is fascinating and of course as one based on actual events it has some added kick br br nice sets br br the soviets working with the boyce and are portrayed very well and not stereotyped or given evil just for the sake of making them look bad br br didn't hurt it didn't help br br the music is alright nothing perfect though br br sound effects are occasionally a little was the case with a lot of films from the seventies through the eighties br br the bad br br chris boyce timothy hutton has a relationship with a woman that we hardly know because of trouble brewing with the us and soviet governments her life can be put in this isn't as expanded upon as it feels it should've been minor problem though br br the ugly br br the apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a little unnerving nothing like a constant state of to keep the masses feeling as unsafe as possible br br memorable scene br br seeing the first cia report accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason being rough night br br this was another film that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of the story studios and producers didn't see how a movie about two american traitors could ever be accepted by american audiences luckily it's filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality of course it helps that the traitorous anti heroes aren't portrayed like a couple young men who've made gross errors in judgment in their lives as such it becomes a very human drama and one portrayed very well and very believably br br acting 9 10 story 10 10 atmosphere 8 10 cinematography 8 10 character development 9 10 special effects make up 8 10 little quantity high quality nudity sexuality 2 10 one scene in a strip club violence gore 7 10 no gore just some violence music 7 10 direction 9 10 br br cheesiness 0 10 crappiness 0 10 br br overall 8 10 br br if you like films about espionage and spies then you can't go wrong here if you like dramatic films with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters then this may also work for you highly recommended br br www residenthazard com
