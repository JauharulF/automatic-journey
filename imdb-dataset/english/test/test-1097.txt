<START> another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti hero makes it hard to decide who to root for br br if nothing else the beguiled silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies at least in 1971 there were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed br br pamelyn ferdin did a fine job as amy and would go on to play wanda june this must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve year old girl on camera wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time it was probably polanski's favorite scene given the fate of amy's turtle randolph it is no surprise that ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist br br geraldine page was likewise excellent playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint it is interesting that she died just three days after elizabeth hartman committed suicide throwing herself through a fifth floor window as they had also worked together in you're a big boy now br br hartman who looks like she could be blair brown's sister was wonderful as edwina and should have gotten an oscar no other performance was even close that year but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch like marilyn monroe's incredible performance in the misfits the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing br br finally there is jo ann harris who is stunningly perfect as the flirty carol for my money harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970's combining sensuality with intelligence and humor she was the best reason to watch the most wanted television series and the only reason to watch wild wild west revisited hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star
<START> the future of fantasy never looked so dark christopher lambert gets to fight the evil demon grendel in this grim looking trashy fantasy epos epos i said er there's only one location so you can't really call it an epic adventure can you the location is a medieval futuristic 5 inch tall castle so how did they manage to cram in all the actors oh i get it those where special effects a miniature silly me br br here's some reasons why you might want or not want to watch this motion picture br br lambert gets to do his sword swinging tricks over again like he did in highlander br br the sets and costumes are amazingly cool if you're a 12 year old br br has a voluptuous pair of knockers which she likes to show off through out the whole movie br br er christopher lambert has white hair br br every time they start fighting this over the top raving techno soundtrack gets going so why are these medieval slayer dudes fighting while they should be dancing br br they don't have electricity in this castle but they do have speakers installed which seem to work fine so where's the i guess they borrowed it from the techno dj who delivered the soundtrack br br watch it for the climax in the end which features an outrageous cgi creature coming straight out of any playstation 2 survival horror game br br if all this got you interested then go watch it at your own risk but don't tell anyone i told you to i strongly suspect pinhead visiting the set while shooting because this movie has no soul anyway if you want to see beautiful really show some skin then watch paul verhoeven's hollow man
<START> gone with the wind and scarlett are two different films they were never meant to be compared obviously the original actors in gwtw are all passed away and deserved their own separate award and praise i loved gwtw and never really expected a sequel to be made or ever live up to half the praise of gwtw but to my shock scarlett was just as well written directed and acted as gwtw scarlett in its own right deserves just as much award i now can honestly say i don't know which i like better i think the script for scarlett was a number 1 as a sequel bravo writer director producer and all actors bravo as sequels rarely live up to their name sake this one runs equal to its predecessor to those who don't like it you miss the point and a great ending to phenomenal beginning
<START> i say sadly because if you see this movie now you realize how low our media has sunk all the warning signs are in this movie br br it's a great film i think the last great james brooks film but others may disagree it has rich characters who are believable as well great acting great writing and although the music got a little cheesy i even liked that br br william hurt has never been better holly hunter is stunning and albert brooks walks away with every scene he's in this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and made the whole movie soar above it's vital and important topic of the news and how it's slowly being compromised in our nation br br watch this with network for a truly fun and frightening evening
<START> stephen is a genius he is the king of geniuses watching this movie makes me feel dumb but it's a great movie not highly entertaining but very very intriguing the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen a man who makes einstein look average and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe time the galaxy and black holes everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they'll write it all down well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours here is a man who despite suffering from lou gehrig's disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes awesome you won't be the same after you see it
<START> i see it when i was 12 year old and i dream to see it again br br what marvelous sammy davis jr singing it ain't necessarily so
<START> the best part in this movie is the first one located in sicily i suppose shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising the rest of the story is quite boring uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters trying to melt suggestions and video music technique surrealistic and a very annoying and completely off topic soundtrack leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short frankly this is a real overrated movie and is a real overrated director
<START> don't be greedy sums up the depth of this movie all the rest of the baloney is big budget window dressing the movie rotates through hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much none of the potentially interesting plot tangents are developed yet the trite ones are hashed and rehashed to excess br br the charm of dd as others have pointed out was in the schizophrenia device the humor woven into the fabric of the movie and most importantly the acting there is enough wooden acting in the box to attract a giant mound of martian termites br br the biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this mess is the glaring question why would a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do any testing at all awful failure of a movie
<START> i can get over the political parody even if this was suppose to be a masters of horror flick br br but what i can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes and their sacrifice as pawns in some washed up horror maker's political statement br br to me it was purely insulting to arlington and our heroes i have family at arlington the idea that this guy dante would even portray the arlington graves being disturbed just makes me want to puke br br i'm done with dante and done with moh
<START> in 1983 two bond movies was made one was the official bond movie octopussy starring roger moore who starred as james bond for the first time in live and let die and the other was the unofficial bond movie never say never again starring sean connery who played the role as james bond for the first time in dr no that film was also the first 007 james bond movie to be made never say never again is called unofficial because the company that made the other james bond movies didn't make this one never say never again is also a remake of the 1965 007 movie thunderball there are several differences in never say never again that lets you know it wasn't made by eon one thing is that the opening is different there's no gun barrel sequence and no pre credit sequence another difference is the music score some things in this movie does feel like a james bond movie like the gadgets and cars plus james bond always getting it on with the ladies and the film does have an opening credits song sean connery still does a great job playing bond the acting from the other stars is also great br br never say never again is a good film that's just has entertaining as the official james bond films check this out 10 10
<START> this is one of my favorites betty white and leslie neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy one is a business executive who re evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year the other is a playboy who has tired of gold digging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital mature woman if you've got silver in your hair and or romance in your heart microwave the popcorn curl up with your honey and prepare yourself for a treat
<START> if regarded as an independent feature i can't say it's too bad at all but from where i'm standing this sequel and the original lady and the tramp don't agree with each other they are two completely different movies with different style different voice personalities different narratives and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals e g the town house of jim dear darling lady and tramp and none of those have changed br br if you're seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like bella notte and the cats song this sequel won't give you any at all just about every song has a little pop to it and those good old characters like jock and trusty jim dear and darling and aunt sarah and her cats may well be seen but they're seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters not to mention peg not appearing at all whose voices are quite annoying even lady and tramp don't appear often enough and as for scamp he is so spoilt and treats his father tramp with utter disrespect then runs away with no remorse even after hearing how much he's being missed at home and they called his shameless getaway an adventure i'd say scott wolf truly brought out the abusive bad boy in scamp wiping out the typical cute disney animal even the old characters just drive you mad in this trusty sounds like goofy sick in bed jock jeff stupid bennett and his voice sound neither scottish nor worth hearing zap him off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb feather brained exasperating junkyard dogs somebody put them down br br lady and the tramp 2 isn't completely bad if you're not already having a tough day but i expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic scamp is so is his girlfriend angel and there is a feeble storyline still i think you should try it at least once because as i say there are much worse movies around
<START> this version of mansfield park while being extremely accurate to the novel lacked the compassion i felt for fanny which is crucial and central to this jane austen story this was due to the total lack of acting ability by the actress le she had no appeal and at times appeared to be either lost in space or out of her depth the scene she has with her uncle where she breaks down in hysterics was hysterical she badly overplayed that crucial scene and i actually felt sorry that henry crawford ever cared for her br br the polar opposite is the portrayal of mary crawford by jackie smith wood what a wonderful actress in a very difficult part to make that character witty and self centered selfish yet vulnerable to love br br i have always loved fanny she is mild mannered but with an implacable sense of what is right and who she thinks is worthy of respect and admiration the fanny in this adaptation is too meek and subservient with hardly a thought of her own until near the end of the series as much as i wanted to like this fanny i just could not br br i suggest skipping this version of mansfield park for the real thing the novel fanny will not disappoint you will love her
<START> jewel thief is one of those suspense thrillers in which the viewers are left guessing till the end who the villain is suspense builds from the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are cleverly concealed clues in the film so that you can guess who is the jewel thief the story portrays that dev anand vinay in the film and the jewel thief have identical faces but you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally come to know the villain there are many surprises and a lot of fishy stuff going on but there is time for romance and six melodious ever lasting songs sung by lata mangeshkar asha bhosle kumar and rafi br br this film was also talked about for its song's videos consider the teasing and counter teasing in ke or the blocking of road by dev anand when tanuja was going out with her friends in yeh dil na hota or the romantic dil are are in the beautiful or the wonderful dance by in pe add to it gaya mera and raat hain and you will never forget this film for any reason br br able acting by dev anand ashok kumar tanuja and and direction by vijay anand dev anand's younger brother makes this one of the best loved hindi films of all times even today
<START> when i think bollywood i think of lite feel good musical dance numbers with gorgeous outfits on the men and women and catchy tunes horror thrillers mystery and suspense don't come to mind though and this to my western eyes is like an abstract comedy br br i think it would have been a better movie shorter even if the writer and the director had made a definite choice either gone for outright thriller horror comedy mystery supernatural suspense or musical romance instead of an awkward mixture of them all br br i'll have to say more than once i thought the director must have seen i know what you did last summer and tried to give it a bollywood twist my first film was bride prejudice which i thought was acted well br br this seemed like what a western audience would consider a straight to video cheese fest br br the acting was over the top at times it felt like they were intentionally trying to parody western thrillers but when you saw them try to inject the dramatic crying screaming or fear it felt out of place br br the viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would wink at the camera more than a few times when the audience was supposed to be horrified we could only snicker a the absurdity br br i watch a lot of foreign films and even though i don't know hindi i have to say they did a poor job subtitling the film sometimes it was difficult to read the white lettering against the bright background br br the villain was particularly amusing at least to me because he came with his own mood music the supposed surprising twist actually felt like a cop out br br the lead couples were handsome pretty enough and the musical numbers made it worth my rental fee i'd suggest it to someone as a musical comedy but i'd tell them to just fast forward the rest of the movie because it wasn't worth the effort of reading if you're determined to read a whole subtitled hindi flick then check out the superior romantic drama london' br br but i was not scared unless that's really what they think is horrifying in india 1 out of 10 for what it's being touted as 6 out of 10 for it's unintentional quickness ability to illicit lots of laughs and it's musical dance numbers enjoy
