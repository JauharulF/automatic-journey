<START> i first saw the opening of otto preminger's and bess on tv probably some time in the early 80s and my younger self found it a bit slow despite the timeless music i turned it off br br last night an extremely rare cobbled together print screened at the l a cinematheque and it was a bit of a revelation the performances are strong and memorable dorothy dandridge brings a great deal of vulnerability strength and subtle at least by today's standards eroticism to her part sidney poitier is said to be uncomfortable with the movie but his performance is terrific as is pearl bailey even better are sammy davis as the amoral cat like life and brock peters as the bully crown br br still i'm no fan of preminger's earlier leaden and far easier to see carmen jones and bess is far superior to that less controversial film though that may have to do with the fact that the source material is also far superior br br as seen last night this is a sturdy but far from perfect work not all of the moments quite come alive and there is some awkwardness in the way the film mixes the overtly stylized catfish row set beautifully done by oliver smith with actual locations also even to my rather untrained ear some brief portions of the score seem unduly popularized br br moreover while this doesn't detract from the achievement of the filmmakers preminger's decision to film almost entirely in wide shots with no close ups and occasional medium shots no doubt rendered it unwatchable on tv panned and scanned and may doom it even on widescreen dvds if it gets the restoration it deserves on smaller screens we won't be able to make out the many details that are crucial to the way preminger staged the film br br also the mix heard last night was odd many of the vocals particularly on the opening summertime seemed unduly soft and were overwhelmed by the instrumental music perhaps this can be fixed in a restoration br br there is the issue of the film's racial politics personally i see nothing wrong with it at least in a contemporary context at the time when so few films depicted strong african american characters this may have seemed an unfortunate choice for a big budget hollywood film and while there may not be much empowering here these are recognizable human beings that are not racial stereotypes these are operatic characters who make poor choices because that's what tragic characters do that alone made it a giant stride forward at the time br br in a modern context where strong and heroic african american characters are less rare though still not common enough these characters seem nothing more nor less than human they truly could be poor and people of any ethnic background br br thorny politics aside the original work is undoubtedly one of the truly great achievements of american music and theater poitier davis dandridge peters and yes pearl bailey were all amazing performers who we'll never see the likes of again this less than perfect but still solid film clearly deserves to be seen and treasured
<START> the abc gears up it's repertory company for another unrealistic representation of rural australia yes folks it's all there jeremy sims an actor of little talent fire hero libby tanner plays craig in the bush fifi nadia townsend town slut preggers by brother joe i think then there's uncle geoff the big daddy of lost springs uncle scenes are like tennessee williams on speed only saving grace is russian actress natalia as loony missus she is great i can't understand why john waters took the gig as lilly's psychologist husband must have needed the money i expect still he won't last long as and will be having it off suit just watch this lemon to see how bad an aussie show can be frankly i'm ashamed
<START> did you find the title funny oh you didn't well that's because you're uptight learn to laugh because if you're not laughing you're not living so please lower your standards regarding to what you believe is funny to that of a mere infant now do you find it funny still no ok that's because you're full of yourself and get offended too easily if you're not laughing you're not living and if you don't like me then send me hate mail so that i could write another review and state how much hate mail i get and try to twist this into making it seem as if i am a bad ass are you laughing at my hilarious title yet still no ok that's it you are a racist you have to laugh or else you are a racist why else would you not laugh oh it's not funny no this can't be why i want it to be funny so therefor it is laugh damn it please please ok that's it where's my notepad and pen and where's my richard pryor dvd's i need to write some jokes for my show br br and scene thank you thank you br br this is basically what you'll get from mencia for about 23 minutes please do yourself a favor and change the channel when this bum's show comes on even basic cable channels have things 100x better than this i'm not even saying this because i hate him i'm for real this show is like watching grass grow not sure though at least grass doesn't steal jokes i'm honestly trying to save your time i even tried watching his show i told myself maybe he isn't that bad but no he is i completely zone out when i watched his show i tried to collect myself during the commercial break and focus on the show but i couldn't i zoned out again i think i was thinking of something more interesting like re making my bed or folding my socks before i knew it the show was over yeah it's that bad br br here's my final thought there's so many things you can do with 30 minutes besides watch this guy shout about nothing for half an hour don't watch a show that tries to shove racism in your face in vain i can support shows that try to ease the tension of the race wars but this guy just provides more racism rather than stop it
<START> i don't know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie i've seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that i'm amazed they kept having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard correctly it becomes things like malcom i x and which is norwegian for foreign affairs br br like the word many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to build on with a film that's simply comical from beginning to end br br recommended in all languages with a good translation
<START> i recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival the film's title and in fact much of the outline of the film is from the robert graves poem beauty in trouble jan directs a screenplay by petr from a story by and the story begins in 2002 when prague is hit by one of those devastating 100 year floods that destroys the household of ana and roman and their two children kuba adam and lucina because of the moldy conditions where they now live asthma is life threatening works and runs a chop shop out of the garage they live next to shady occupation runs him afoul of the law and one of his theft victims becomes infatuated with josef is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between italy and the czech republic and offers to care and her two kids jana is marcella's mother who lives with her common law husband called uncle richie played by jirÃ­ in probably the film's best role rounding out this excellent cast is as mentally fragile mother who gives any money she gets to the local religious charlatan there is a lot going on here for a small film and it's good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief ales provides the music score with additional music from czech singer and irish singer glen there is a lot to like about this film and i would give it an 8 0 out of 10 and recommend it
<START> the story of sweeney todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like charles dickens and more contemporary writers like edward gory as a musical it naturally becomes more like the musical les miserables both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the industrial revolution and the breakdown of organized society but this musical is different from les mis in one very important aspect stephen sondheim the songwriter who can adapt to any style to be sure he's had his successes and failures but one thing about his shows you can always count on they will be something unique who would have thought someone would write a musical about a barber who slits people's throats and makes them into meat pies sondheim did and he did it marvelously the entire show is set in a factory to suggest the ever present catastrophic effects of the misery of those at the bottom of society and this serves the needs of the show perfectly the catwalks and are moved throughout to suggest streets and walkways and bridges techniques are borrowed from kabuki and with the visual stagehands and set changes then to top it all off cast the great angela lansbury as the gruesomely practical and humorous mrs lovett and george with his operatic baritone voice as the murderous todd and you've got yourself a stellar musical vehicle the rest of the cast moves smoothly through the clichÃ©s of the love story perfectly except for johanna and who sound a bit too forced if the johanna and from the broadway show could be here it would be perfect acts while he sings more than len on the album and the accents don't sound as forced here through it all sondheim's score never fails to underline the dark seriousness of the story as i said he can adapt to any style in follies he imitates the '30s '40s style of showtunes in pacific overtures he captures the subtle art of asian music into the woods knocks off the 32 bar disney style songs and assassins covers a history of american music here however he does wonders in making his score distinctly english from parlour songs to operatic duets and soliloquies to society waltzes to gilbert sullivan style patter and yet still the show remains deadly serious even though it provokes more laughs than any musical comedy in it still is a grim warning on the evils of taking revenge here is where this movie makes a mistake in cutting the judge's solo in which he himself out of guilt for his crimes without it the judge is just a conventional villain and this movie's point is that there are no straight villains both todd and the judge learn too late the horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions and todd loses everything in his obsession this is well brought out by the chilling reprise of the grim yet rollicking ballad of sweeney todd ending the show with todd and lovett rising from the grave to tell us that the end is the same in a world full of vengeance begets only vengeance attend the tale of sweeney todd he served a dark and a vengeful god to seek revenge may lead to hell but everyone does it and seldom as well as sweeney as sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street
<START> documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and by the process their own lives are not that uncommon also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent a failure of introspection an abundance of narcissism and perhaps an unsubtle quest for publicly splashed revenge for countless past hurts real and fantasized what is unusual is a brilliant fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and my architect a son's journey is that rare achievement br br louis kahn emigrated to this country as a child his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident he and his parents settled in philadelphia where the talented youngster loved art and music soon he became enamored of buildings and decided only an career would answer his creative abilities br br kahn became an architect but as this film shows it took a long time before he attracted the attention of the leaders in his field one architect suggests that he was a victim of the yellow armband that anti semitism that along with bias against women was long a disreputable aspect of the american profession of architecture br br when he did achieve notice he was seen clearly accurately as a self assured workaholic prophet exclaiming unyielding demands that his vision and only his vision be realized that was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for many buildings he built but a few the interview with an aged gentleman who fired kahn in philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and walked into the city is hilarious br br kahn was a born teacher and some of the extensive archival footage here shows him with students his voice steady but passionate their gazes respectful and intense br br many architects were interviewed by director writer and project honcho nathaniel kahn the only son some are world famous i m pei robert a m stone frank and the still active philip johnson their comments paint a vivid picture of this idealistic but in the end financially unsuccessful designer of buildings that blended the castles and grand buildings of past centuries into designs for the present kahn's buildings are shown among the most impressive being the salk research laboratories in la ca to me his style has a neo romantic air deadened by too much blank space that repels rather than attracts human interaction br br but kahn's son was after more than the story of his father the architect for many years louis kahn had three families a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long term relationships one of which produced a daughter the other the son kahn visited his son at the mother's home often but at the end of an evening mother and son would drive kahn back to the marital home nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships but he doesn't appear to be scarred by what was certainly a strange affair for a little boy br br when nathaniel was a young boy louis kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room of new york's pennsylvania station after returning from india where he had pitched one of his massive projects another one that was never built at that point his philadelphia firm was at least 500 000 in debt and had he lived a trip to the federal bankruptcy court was probably in the offing br br kahn left several monumental structures of which the government building in bangladesh is clearly the biggest a teary local architect hails kahn for having created a building where democracy may and hopefully will flourish br br fellow architect opines that there might have been something fitting in kahn's suffering a mortal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globetrotting i disagree it's sadly ironic that kahn should die in the faceless replacement for one of america's true architectural gems the old pennsylvania station wrecked to make way for a sterile replacement with no character and no continuation of civic memory br br there are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger kahn's journey including with his half sisters and his mother but they're genuine and moving not maudlin and staged historians of architecture will always study kahn his son found reasons to remember him as a flawed but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man br br 9 10
<START> this is one of the most enjoyable teen movies i have ever seen and that i wished was released to video it was released the same year as another great comedy in which tim matheson played a role animal house which is probably why it was overlooked br br one of the most memorable parts of this film would definitely be the soundtrack which could have and should have been a formal label release the soundtrack features a lesser known 70's act named high whose song we are the future played a marquee role in the movie's prom scene i remember purchasing the group's album out as a kid mainly because of the look of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talents br br the closing song is one of the best ballads i have ever heard and i can still hear it in my head i wish i knew the group's name so that i could look for it somewhere in cyberspace br br if you liked films such as over the edge and rich kids i think this is one that you will enjoy as well
<START> tom selleck plays an absentee son to senile pop don ameche and weary mom anne jackson making up for his indiscretions one presumes and taking them in after ameche has burned down his mobile home meanwhile job is vanquished by the f b i his assets are frozen his wife and kids leave him and his obnoxious sister and her brats have come to stay brightly painted comedy of ills is as out of touch with reality as ameche's doddering old coot perhaps a serious first draft with scenes such as ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers was incorporated into a sillier second or third version with selleck getting poked bumped prodded and eventually losing a toe and a testicle either way it's a painful experience and sudden dedication to his father makes little sense he around and howls in pain but retains his heart of mush this movie is mush from
<START> a wonderful family movie a beautiful horse movie 75 entertainment casey buddy kelly marsh are very interesting and lovable characters the horses are real beauties br br has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons the very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to br br andrew rubin puts in a wonderful performance as buddy the sensible elder brother somewhat reminded me of aidan quinn eyes speech delivery facial appearance br br casey makes you fall in love with the character because of the earnestness sarah blue is also nicely portrayed by alexis smith lloyd the father is played by walter matthau and he is the character br br though there is room for improvement in the movie its a very enjoyable feel good movie
<START> the best thing one can say about the film traffic is that it brought attention to the superior british mini series as many people have noted the current film suffers from the story to accommodate the short attention span of and the turn around time of the theater owners who measure a film's success by the overpriced food sales br br i first recorded this mini series in 1990 when it was shown on public tv and have watched it many times the whole documentary style series has a strong element of tragedy and doom about it as the characters are all moving toward their eventual fate the strongest of the three tales is that of the pakistani family forced into the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the poppy crop is burned by the army in a staged show of force put on for the benefit of western politicians the hardships of the family are similar to that of the rickshaw pullers family in city of joy eventually the farmer finds work but he compromises his pride and honesty br br the pakistani segment of the film has a particular relevance to today with the fight against the supporters of al and gives some understanding of the support for such movements among the disadvantaged poor of pakistan and afghanistan who rarely receive any of the money going into those countries the film makes a point that the farmers see barely 25 of the aid which is supposed to encourage them to grow other crops br br with the american inability to see anything other than in terms of black and white good guys v bad guys it is interesting to see another view where there is no black and white only shades of grey br br possible spoiler ahead the only problem i had with the story was that rather than things continuing as they did before as they would in real life being a work of fiction they had to wrap it up with the bad guys getting what was coming to them other than that this was a fine piece of work of the kind we see all too rarely the cast was outstanding and the german and pakistani locations helped give the film a different feel what a change it made seeing germans as something other than the villains in a wwii film
<START> just like all of mel brooks' other comedies men in tights is hilarious but in seeing this as an outrageous comedy i think many fail to realize that the reason the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves are acted so well elwes is the well spoken former british noble lewis is an eternally annoyed king i hope it's worth all the deluise is a fantastic godfather roger rees is a worried and cynical sheriff the actors and actresses are so loyal to their parts that the jokes flow forth with ease yes we've seen this kind of comedy before but the only comedy to achieve better character development in my opinion is the big lebowski very very funny
<START> doug mcclure has starred in a few of these british produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot i know the land that time forgot has its critics but please at least that movie featured location filming and relatively good production values that's the problem with this movie the production values go way beyond so bad they're good affectionate territory and become so bad i think i'll go and see what's on the other channels br br one case in point is the first scene featuring the intrepid cushing and mcclure encountering a monster it's painfully obvious the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster being made to look over twenty foot tall via overblown back projection it becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot have i mentioned that this is one of the more convincing set pieces no really this looks like it was filmed in somebody's living room with the spare change left over from that year's doctor who budget even former doctor who peter cushing is bland and what should have been an amusing line you can't me i'm british is delivered in a very flat way a very similar line is spoken by cushing in horror express in a script devoid of characterisation plotting and memorable dialogue it's not just the fact that the dialogue is unmemorable it's also infrequent and rare since the monsters don't speak wouldn't it have been better having the chief bad guys humanoids like in warlords of atlantis so that they could explain the plot does anyone here know what the plot actually is br br a very tedious british movie that even the twin talents of caroline munro can not save the whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence featuring two keystone cops
<START> the most enjoyable pet movie since scooby doo and garfield the story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named brian foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing brian is also dating the boss's daughter named casey but brian secretly invented a robotic dog named chomps modeled after his own dog rascal but chomps is no ordinarily dog he is as fast as a cheetah he has x ray vision can leap about 6 feet and has a strength of 20 men the new invention impresses his boss and makes his business a success but when the company rivals hear about chomps they try to find a way to capture him can chomps outwit them before its too late this movie is a classic for all ages
<START> a trio sit at a restaurant table and stare into space later they lean on a rail and stare across the channel at england a man works a hoe repetitively in his garden only his head and upper torso visible on the screen a man and a woman watch another man peeing against a stone wall each of these silent shots lasts for roughly one full minute absolutely no information is imparted that could not be given to us in about one quarter of the time the editor must have been half asleep i know i was br br the movie open with a startling shot of the raw vagina of an obviously dead body one's gorge rises but then the policeman exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and begins to tag along after them and the case is forgotten for the next half hour while and his friends trade unfunny insults with each other and with strangers eventually the thread of the case is picked up again but proceeds slowly almost aimlessly following the stylistic pattern already established br br sometimes in movies like this the location shooting provides a kind of atmosphere that compensates for the dullness of the story but not here the houses of the french village are attached to one another in long rows the house fronts abut the pavement directly with no steps the fronts show virtually no decoration and are pretty much indistinguishable the flat are featureless what might have been one of the more interesting episodes a visit to a stone fort on the coast bores the trio until they begin behaving like and are asked to leave br br the acting is minimal nobody seems particularly anxious to say anything no jokes are made nothing amusing happens the policeman has a face almost as interesting as randy quaid's the babe a tall hefty blonde looks like the kind of shot putter on steroids that the east germans used to field at the olympic games br br i sat through more than an hour of it before giving it up maybe i'll take a crack at it some other time unless i've missed something or unless it turns into some deranged monty python routine towards the end i don't think you'll get much out of renting it
