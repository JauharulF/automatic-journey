<START> detective dave is trying to link the murder of a local hooker to new orleans mobster julie but during his investigation is led into a series of surreal encounters with a troop of confederate soldiers what a awful plot and it was worser than i had expected it was real slow and had minimal skill in the acting i could not watch through it it was waste of my time another flop i would give it under 1 if i could please people don't waste your time its 1 of wast full time actor sykes and his girlfriend driving under the influence as dave takes to the station the actor tells dave he found some skeletal remains while on the set of a movie he is filming
<START> it's particularly hard for a director to capture film making without getting precious inbred over dramatic or all three ably demonstrates the instinctive lizard brain methods of a female auteur in extracting from two cattle as hitchcock called actors a love scene of searing intimacy her main battle is with her leading man an actor is really a woman she opines although naturally it is the leading lady who will steal the show i disagree that this is first comedy 'romance' was at various points hilarious but i accept that the french sense of humour can be elusive for foreigners indeed dozens of imdb reviewers detected no comedy in romance by contrast sex is comedy raises plenty of laughs mainly by using an actor's prop that goes back thousands of years to and the ancient greeks we wondered leaving the theatre whether beard was a wig a lovely performance from anne as wrestling with her own script looking ten years younger than her age
<START> the man who knew too much 1956 is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in 1934 with the same name in my opinion his later effort is far superior many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn't have the spine tingling suspense of the original with peter lorre in both films the plot is essentially the same except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in it tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man that is very curious about their past it just so happens he's an agent that's looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader then he gets stabbed in a market because of it being found out that he's a spy and proceeds to fall into stewart's arms dying he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot stewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son the film contains excellent performances by stewart and day in a straight dramatic role as worried and frightened parents this film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals the direction by alfred hitchcock is top notch the film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute the scene in albert hall is a classic the original is so slow paced and drab i don't know how people can compare the two just watch the remake and you'll enjoy it i give the movie a 9 out of 10
<START> i've been a devoted imdb visitor for a few years this is the movie that finally compelled me to write in a review br br i caught this movie by chance the opening credits happened to be scrolling past when i turned my tv on one morning i thoroughly enjoyed the film for many reasons all of which have been well covered by other reviewers the moodiness the forgotten history of the czech pilots the subtle charm of the supporting characters the fatalism of the main characters and the first person view during the battle scenes br br but the element of dark blue world that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects especially during combat and this is a good thing while the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them no manipulative shots of worried spouses girlfriends were interwoven every little aerial maneuver did not elicit trite patriotic cheers and viewers weren't asked to swallow unbelievable james bond esque pilot heroics instead the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while they try to stay aloft during combat as comrades are shot down we are spared tearful howls and the typical but audience pleasing revenge based heroics instead the other pilots sadly and quietly observe their fellow pilot's fate in reality they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and objectives at that very moment we only briefly experience the pilot's breathing and the background roar of the engines as we the audience witness a friend spiral quietly down to his death and then immediately need to jump back into combat mode and focus on survival br br too often in hollywood we're spoon fed the emotions we're supposed to feel and no room is left for the viewer's imagination dark blue world maintains a that captivates and involves the viewer allowing us to invest in the movie and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings br br excellent film well worth seeing
<START> now the sci fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films house of the dead 2 all souls day etc but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor writer and now director bruce campbell you get one of the best damn made for tv independent horror films ever made i normally hate these movies in my previous review house of the dead 2 i could not believe how horrible the film was but somehow i took a liking for this film a very good liking for this film the violence is good and so is the black comedy in the film and i recommend you get it a true bruce campbell masterpiece well since there is only a few more lines left i can say whatever i want about this movie
<START> this is a great movie when two people from different backgrounds and social status think that they have nothing to offer each other and in the end they what each other needs it a testament to what the heart knows sometimes we wonder why one man is with a woman or vise versa and the outward appearances say one thing to our eye but what they offer each other from within that we cannot see is amazing and unexplainable when thought that matthew had nothing to offer her and when matthew was only looking for a fling because he had an open marriage w his wife jenny in the end they realized that they could not and did not want to exist without the other it was worth it to them to resist what family and friends thought and what society said was right to be with each other this movie kind of restores my faith in love
<START> i caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and i haven't laughed that hard in a long time this movie was so funny i went out and bought the very next day i love this type of comedy it just seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here i was rollin i had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title seeing other people the title caused me to give it a shot and i'm glad i did i laughed so hard that it hurt now it's part of my collection i definitely recommend it to all those that enjoy smart ass type of comedy i will be watching this one over and over
<START> this mystery psychological thriller is i think one of the best i've ever seen all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard you won't forget this movie
<START> i logged on here right after watching this movie feeling that it was so awful that at least its reviews might be entertaining but all you miscreants appear to kind of like it and so since i want the job done right br br from the opening shot the movie establishes its contempt for the audience's attention span by showing an entirely unremarkable picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long long time then it goes to some slow motion skateboarding which is at least a little bit cool but then offsets that glimmer of excitement by the most repellent soundtrack song i've ever heard some girl screeching in whispery french over what sounds like sheets of plywood banging together whoever decided that needed to be there has never ridden a skateboard i guarantee it it seemed to be there to test the limits of the audience's patience br br from there the movie is about 50 per cent slow motion you know what's worse than a gratuitous slow motion shot a gratuitous slow motion shot of nothing happening here's a guy walking along a path here's a guy sitting here's a guy looking around here's a guy looking at another guy after a while i started watching the movie at double speed bringing it back down whenever people appeared on screen engaging in actual dialog which was rare once astonishingly i slowed the movie to find out what a girl was saying only to find that the camera was showing her talking but the sound was another horrible horrible song and her actual voice was not audible br br this reminds me of some great advice i heard once about writing if you don't have anything to say don't use fancy tricks to pretend as though you do get back to work and think of something to say all these camera tricks like the slow motion and weird lighting and lenses and freaky music is what the absence of content looks and sounds like a lot of people have apparently bought it and perceive emotional gravity and deep meaning but i think they are projecting this onto a movie that did not do any of the work involved in creating it
<START> a very different jerry lewis film not like all those more famous films that everybody knows lewis deals with the difficult task of ww ii and national socialism in germany in a rather unconventional way but even more interesting and important he does it in a very un american way and as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry un american means more sophisticated more subtle more intelligent or simply better that is the reason why the film was no success in the us but a very great success in europe br br all in all jerry lewis has proven by this movie that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick comedy
<START> i just saw this at and i absolutely loved it there were parts where i laughed so hard i couldn't catch my breath the script and direction by glenn are fantastic i can't wait to see more from this talented young man the performances make the movie larry fessenden and dominic monaghan are just delightful as the willy and his apprentice arthur ron perlman turns in a fantastic performance as usual as a less than sympathetic jailhouse priest bonus angus scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor as always he balances menace and humor perfectly br br this is a style of horror comedy that really hasn't been seen since vincent price did comedy of terrors the raven and theater of blood the movie is genuinely scary in places then it'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode keeping you totally off balance some parts are scary and funny at the same time br br i can only afford to see three movies at this year but even if the other two are awful i sell the dead was worth the price of all three i'm going to be looking for more movies from larry fessenden's glass eye pix he's giving the horror genre a much needed kick in the butt
<START> anupam kher is an excellent actor he debuted at 28 playing a 50 yr old in br br now he turns director with br br the film has a good plot but it's regressive br br the theme has been done to death and urmila's character looks too put on while anil and abhi tara tracks are too sudden and then forgotten br br the film moves a snail pace and begins to drag but there are several good scenes like the entire conflict between anil fardeen and abhishek where fardeen says to sell the house br br abhishek getting caught for a crime and anil shouting at him br br the climax is too much though br br anupam shows potential but has some way to go music is okay br br anil kapoor excels in his part like always fardeen tries hard and is okay but needs to improve abhishek is excellent this was a turning pt people realized he can act urmila is okay and tara are wasted waheeda is good
<START> boy next door is a hilarious romp through male neurosis in just over fifteen minutes the film takes us on a journey that most full length features can't even match great performances excellent camera work and editing this short is a classic from start to finish kudos to travis davis for pulling double duty as both director and star he's the funniest nebbish since woody allen and what a treat to see richard moll back again if you thought all he could do was play bull the bailiff on night court think again this gem of a film showcases the brilliantly funny writing of stephen remember that name forget charlie kaufman steve is the true current king of quirky comedy
<START> if this movie would have been in english all critics would have trashed it the language is extremely bad the scenes are awfully directed and it's not at all funny after the movie i thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts oh on dogs as well the story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature av glas that premiered almost at the same time of course the public chose while av glas got little attention br br what was really disturbing for me was the fact that the movie looked really bad that was probably due to the fact that first time director josef fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play around with it for fun i suppose the result however is a movie that can easily be split into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each one of them this was very frustrating maybe josef fares should have stayed with his short films since that seems to be the only art form he can master br br another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together at several times in the middle of the movie the story has to move on very quickly and the characters then run into one another in a way that is just too unbelievable br br and then i have not mentioned the 2 dimensional characters especially those in the supporting roles br br even though i consider this one of the worst swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated it is kind of understandable that the public liked it i mean bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses br br i'm more surprised that the critics enjoyed it they should have known better br br grade 2 of 10 br br
<START> when i watched l'appartement with my girlfriend she sighed how complicated and she is right of course when you are used to simple one linear plots especially violent hero vs crook schemes l'appartement is hard to follow a couple of the negative reviewers here also have missed one or more important points other whine about the confusing flash backs come on this is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet come back and get hooked again within a few seconds this one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when the director has left more than enough clues in all scenes br br the first 3 4 of the movie centers about the question why did max and lisa split the film as my girlfriend remarked begins as a romantic suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again having experience with french movies i predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and i was right in the end of the first part it becomes clear after many twists and turns that max and lisa were manipulated by alice max did not know that lisa had left and why lisa did not know why max did not contact her in rome and left her without a trace when she returned to paris the only one who did was alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut br br after both max and lisa have found out the truth the question of course becomes can alice's manipulations be undone well of course not time has passed by and things have changed br br many european movies use a story telling technique i fully enjoy there is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning after which two or more interested parties try to decide in their own advantage instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters l'appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique in the first half alice seems to be a side character slowly it becomes clear that she is key figure br br acting is simply great vincent cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past monica is very beautiful of course but also competent jean paul provides the necessary comical touch is very convincing as the neurotic woman plagued by feelings of guilt and regret br br the only reason i did not gave it a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfying end of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry after all the events max is exactly on the point where the movie begun only wiser and sadder alice has paid for her sins but still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial max too easily exchanges lisa for alice alice too easily decides to reject max who has been her dream for so long max too easily returns to his fiancÃ©e but then again i don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry i guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty
