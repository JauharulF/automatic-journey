<START> occasionally i accidentally leave the television on after south park and i end up catching some of the train wreck of middle school humor that is mind of mencia it's the only time i wish my room was cleaner because i'd be able to find the remote that much faster the truth is comedy central was in need of a replacement chappelle's show and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots that either miss dave so much they'll cling to any minority variety show or are satisfied with the plain mexicans love jokes that carlos mencia shovels in every week i am to understand though that there are some people out there that actually find mencia shudder funny i firmly stand by my words when i say i believe these people to exist only in myth however if you are indeed out there i ask only that you never enter into my housing district and read these major differences between carlos and chappelle's show br br 1 dave was funny you may want to highlight this one br br 2 chappelle's show was five times as edgy as mencia could ever hope to be yet every time a promo for his little show airs it's all about him tooting his own horn about how he's nothing we've ever seen before you've got that right carlos and not in a good way didn't need to tell people he was edgy and funny we all just kind of stuck around to watch the show to find out for ourselves br br 3 actually had race jokes that dove into some depth of the different cultures things that some people didn't know about like his i know black people game segment the grand prize was some hair cream that black people use that's deeper than mencia would ever dare to dive so how dare he call himself edgy if mencia were writing that sketch the grand prize would have been fried chicken and kool aid and my accusations have some merit i saw a promo for his show which i have affectionately come to call 'my t v monitor taking a s t for thirty minutes' a few days ago and it was some stereotype olympics sketch which i admitted to myself was a pretty funny concept then i saw that the mexican that won received a green card as a grand prize that's it that's as close to the fire as you wanna get who couldn't think of that back in 7th grade for you fans of the show if you're ever watching and you miss one of his punchlines perhaps because you and your friends were discussing how duh de durr never gets old and is in no way the part of the joke where someone funny would have something clever to say just remember that there are only five possible choices for punchlines anyway green card border jumpers lawn and of course duh de just remember whichever it was it was screamed enjoy br br 4 kind of relating to number two every time he says something that gets a laugh he'll pause to tell people while laughing at his own joke that he thinks he went too far with that last one then don't say it for god's sake or let the people decide by themselves he and comedy central keep shoving this tripe down my throat that he's this tell it like it is show that is more controversial than the da vinci code you're not you never will be br br i've never been offended by the show's content i would never give it that much credit i'm offended that carlos mencia is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily yeah i'm literally offended by that fact
<START> like many other commentators here i went in expecting a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity and got more than i asked for i heard and saw a powerful exquisite sometimes haunting sometimes touching lyrical sentimental in the truest way and absolutely stunning blend of music and musicians reminded me a lot of some forms of indian music east indian but at the same time was very very different br br starting from the the first track by baba to the kurdish singer what a voice to to the jam session or ' as we call it in india in the small turkish bar ft big fan now i enjoyed every minute and wished it wouldn't end br br one of the best music commentaries i have seen and heard in a long time br br i am craving for a cd of the sound track and hope i can find it online somewhere soon and also for old and latest albums from baba br br a day later the music is still etched in my brain and i don't want it to go away turkey and specifically istanbul now seem such beautiful and exciting places and i am going to start saving today to go take it in br br faith akin this is a gem
<START> to most of us life is an unfolding process of love for others like soo mi however it is dominated by darkness and fear based on the korean folk tale and kim ji brilliant gothic horror story a tale of two sisters revolves around two sisters soo mi lim su jeong and soo yeon who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy victorian style mansion feeling alienated from the world they cling to each other for survival with the older soo mi obsessively protecting the younger soo yeon against danger for soo mi however not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother's death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality br br while we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with sightings doors that open and close on their own a cruel and overbearing stepmother and other events of high strangeness a tale of two sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge soo mi says do you know what's really scary you want to forget something totally wipe it off your mind but you never can it can't go away you see and and it follows you around like a ghost there is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel the plot cannot be summarized only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective br br in the film's opening soo mi an obviously disturbed young woman is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution when the doctor asks her to describe what happened that day the film flashes back to when soo mi and soo yeon return to the home of their father moo kim su and stepmother yum jung ah the stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is soo mi who is really hurting as the girls try to readjust they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences br br soo mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters people mysteriously disappear from photographs and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity while we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone's mind we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged at least until an important clue is offered in the film's second half br br shot in gorgeous low light cinematography a tale of two sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares and there are plenty it is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to while the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness in the words of a wise observer blame is never the answer whether it is blaming yourself or others rather the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely both of yourself and others forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing
<START> i was fortunate enough to be an extra in this movie when i was about 13 during the roller rink scenes my junior high school drama class was invited to participate it was a fantastic experience br br gary busey charles martin smith and don stroud played the music live all day as a musician i can appreciate the tireless work and dedication these guys put in to their roles they must have played those songs 20 times it's very difficult to maintain consistency and energy under those conditions this is visible during a cut to a close up on that'll be the day but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably wouldn't have picked it up br br skating around all day getting the day off from school and being transported back in time was a incredible thrill i also had my first date on film i had to walk a girl up to the ticket booth woo hoo even with an out of date haircut and hot lights melting the vaseline in my hair it was still worth it fun stuff br br the movie is top notch and is highly satisfying as a whole busey delivers his best role ever and the supporting cast is superb i'm glad to have participated in a great film of the day to think i could have been in corvette summer or something not br br a funny ironic ending to this is that years later i was in a video store in malibu looking at the movie the week it was released on video gary busey walked in and stood right next to me i showed him the cover and on how great he was and how i was an extra and whatnot pretty weird but very cool for what it's worth
<START> i honestly don't know what words imdb will allow me to use in this review as a result i'm having a hard time describing these shorts let's just say there's a good amount of gay sex some necrophilia some incest a fair amount of masturbation and several artificial members and i loved every minute of it br br not that it's all crude humor it isn't they stray away from fart gags for the most part with the exception of one sketch entitled pizza in which they use one very well they being 3 of the short lived sketch comedy group that aired on mtv called the state namely david wain michael and michael ian black br br the trio go on adventures usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people people that are often actually more normal than they are the supporting cast is fantastic as well paul rudd julie bowen bradley cooper zach and sam rockwell all make appearances in various sketches they're also joined by other the state alums like joe lo and todd the musical selections are also very well placed br br i've enjoyed these sketches over and over again but they aren't for everybody as they're pretty vulgar most of the time if you like clever humor that isn't afraid to push the limits of good taste then i highly recommend this if you liked wet hot american summer directed and written by wain and or the state then you should really enjoy this br br i think it can currently only be ordered online check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first and then find out how to buy the dvd
<START> i got monster man in a box set of three films where i mainly wanted the other two but still had a very pleasant time with it it blends horror and comedy to reasonable effect helped out considerably by the decent performances of eric as the geeky lead justin urich as his a hole friend and aimee brooks as the love interest the film is fairly predictable and mines ideas from a host of other films but stays fun throughout with some good gruesome gore thrown in sure it doesn't measure up to the classic gory comedies but this still does fine director michael davis even manages one or two creepy scenes such as in the bathroom or the bar the film is watchable throughout if a little messily plotted and written and for me it only lost it a bit towards the end when the monster man of the title starts to resemble a member of slipknot and the film tries to go more horror style but isn't twisted or convincing enough the final moments are a trifle weak as well still despite lack of much suspense and overall silliness this is a good example of unpretentious often gnarly splatter comedy that should endear itself to fans of the same
<START> probably the biggest thing about wild rebels that hurts it the most is the hero he's got loser written all over him but that doesn't stop him from getting the girl probably one of the world's worst race drivers imaginable he decides to stop racing after he crashes his car well his new job is racing still as a bunch of biker types pick him to drive their getaway car as they commit crimes there's nothing really to endear you to rod even the situation he's thrown into is pretty stupid in the end at the lighthouse scene you'll wish that rod gets killed with all the bikers get this he's shot twice once in the arm and once in the leg and still manages to crawl up the stairs a little if only had better aim br br avoid this one unless you're watching the mst3k version
<START> ouch no real need to say anything else this movie actually had me contemplating suicide as a huge fan of the wonderful genre that is zombie movies i found this to quite possibly be the worst attempt i have ever been privy too the film never actually seemed to go anywhere what was the point to it all i am left feeling hopeless and lost hell this was so bad i cant even justify bashing it anymore i'm just gonna go hang myself in the closet ok now i tried to submit my comment but the server will only accept comments that are ten lines or more so here it goes bad horrible no where near enough gore no tits how can you have a zombie movie without tits as a matter of fact the female lead had one hell of a rack and the only reason i watched the film to completion was in order to maybe by chance get a glimpse nope of course there was one line that does deserve mentioning a line i am looking forward to using myself someday when i just feel the need to get my face smacked this hog isn't going to smoke itself this movie is bad so bad
<START> i love brian yuzna's other work even cruder stuff like 'necronomicon' but was too much even for me my chief complaint is that it's needlessly exploitative of jillian nudity i'm no prude but these nude scenes just drag on and on and on only to culminate virtually every time in a tawdry wink nudge insinuation of sexual violence the scene where she attempts a coat hanger abortion after several minutes of naked screaming is a prime example arnold is utterly turgid but even jeffrey coombs couldn't save this festering heap of a film the aliens are boring the uniformly dull lighting saps your interest and the plot is absolutely predictable the only highlights for me were an all too brief glimpse of the aliens' true form very nice model and the scene where vosloo finds his wife in the closet was ok too but you've been warned
<START> i have watched this film several times over the years and always find it an entertaining experience as a retired airline pilot i am interested in most aviation movies and this is one of the better ones i know that lindbergh was only 25 years old at the time of his historic solo flight to paris and that james stewart was almost 50 when making this movie but i can overlook that fact because stewart has always been one of my all time favorite actors and does one of his usual outstanding performances as the lone eagle br br there is a good mixture of comedy and drama throughout the film and a good use of flashbacks it also helps that james stewart was a pilot in real life both in the military and civilian life
<START> unlike the other spaghetti westerns this one has characters that almost make sense and can be identified to some degree it still has the goofy gunplay of other spaghettis westerns a spaghetti by the way is another word for a western with no plot no characters you can care about and goofy gunplay that doesn't make a bit of sense for the era and relying on great music to make audiences feel something this one is more lighthearted like the ones that bud spencer and terence hill made together they too were superior to the junk made by eastwood and others which sado masochists make their friends watch if they get a chance it looks like everyone had a lot of fun making the movie too it was good to see a giant actor like gilbert roland who wasn't even mentioned on the movie rental box yet who was clearly the biggest name his character was very enjoyable there is a three way standoff at the end which is much superior to the one it spoofs the good the bad and the ugly simply because the characters are at least a bit likable and a bit identifiable not a good movie but has a bit of fun to it
<START> br br heather graham is not just a pretty face she is also an extremely talented actress she adds a unique flavour to the movie overall it's an intelligent and yet compassionate look at love marriage and relationships i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> sci fi channel thinks this is sci fi it's a shame big bugs snakes mythical beasties on and on they persist br br some one at universal had the brains to include battlestar galactica the new good one and firefly for a brief moment in their line up i know they know they difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci fi br br a few years back they were on about how they were going all high and mighty making productions that were not just for us mere lame o trekkies thanks so much sci fi you know you make movies so bad even trekkies won't watch them so you achieved your goal fire serpent ice spiders manticore larva etc and a vast unrelenting crap storm later and they're still churning out just faster than the latest flu virus how they do it is beyond my ken why they do it i just don't know how they can ignore these reviews comments blogs and e mails i don't know either but it's clear they don't think much of their audience or care about our opinions they seem to think this is what sci fi fans want you would think one or two good productions with some sense would creep through when whoever green lights this junk is on vacation at least they're employing the collection of misfit toys many of the sci fi movie of the week actors were in science fiction shows once and now need the cash love you folks and hope you get some better work
<START> in my opinion flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego he was disrespectful to his dancing partner tried to upstage everyone and had no awareness of the spirit of riverdance it's well he left the show colin dunne the new male lead is superb and when he and jean butler dance together magic happens eileen fiddling is astonishing as is noel percussion and maria fire dance is worth the price of admission when pages and get together near the end of the show for a musical duet well it's a genuine treasure i agree the editing isn't complimentary but no technical shortcoming can quell this extraordinary tour de force this is the one to get there's never been anything like riverdance this is the real one
<START> this is certainly a quality movie with a classy cast as far as movies about carlos the go this one beats bruce willis' feeble efforts in 'the to a bloody pulp then spits on them i am a bit surprised that this movie hasn't attracted more votes something of a 'sleeper' obviously a pity because this film is definitely worth a watch it is clever and never dull see it 7 10
