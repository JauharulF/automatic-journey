<START> this movie is in the same league as ishtar lots of wasted talent who let this bomb escape when sigfried says an example has to be made in reference to a nuclear bomb i said please let it be this theatre don't waste your time not even worth a free rental and where did they get these shills to fill the comments section on imdb i can't believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stinker steve carell is not a physical comedian if they removed the comedy and made it a straight action movie it could pass what the heck was the purpose of the dance scene also the fat jokes and references were tasteless this movie never missed a chance to go for the lowest common denominator and scenes just ended it seemed as if no one thought them through just awful save your time if not money and give this movie a pass
<START> noel coward is perfectly cast as a suave vain selfish well educated upper class publisher the literary crowd that congregates at his office is equally lacking in depth and seems concerned only with their status and success they constantly meet at noel coward's publishing office in the hope of gaining favor for their next book and to make sure they are not left out on the latest gossip in the artistic realm br br cora is a young idealist and poet who believes her love can change noel coward and that they can establish a long lasting relationship she ends her relationship with her fiancÃ© to become lover however noel returns to his playboy ways after 6 months and ends the relationship this breaks heart and she eventually returns to her fiancÃ© who has since lost his job and self respect after losing cora br br the story picks up when noel coward leaves new york city by plane chasing after a new lover a concert pianist who is just as shallow as he is however a storm is encountered and the plane crashes into the sea killing noel god takes pity on him and grants him one month on earth to find someone who will cry for him otherwise he is condemned to wander the earth never to find rest for all eternity br br the climax takes place on a dim rainy night and ends with a prayer and a miracle a strange redemption occurs the death experience teaches noel the true values of life although his former associate artists are incapable of understanding his message br br the film has beautiful music and the scenes are classic film noir unfortunately it is not on dvd or vhs for those who enjoy this type of movie it is a classic masterpiece noel coward's dialog is sharp and witty and no one could play the part better
<START> bloody birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters steven andy freeman curtis billy jayne credited as billy jacoby and debbie elizabeth hoy were all born on the same day during an eclipse besides sharing a birthday they also share a love of murder and they're not picky about who they kill either young billy elizabeth and andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too but they can't go on fooling everyone this is an overall good horror flick its not too unrealistic there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well the grown ups are pretty hammy though i'd say its well worth seeing i own a copy myself
<START> i watched this film not knowing anything about it i had presumed it was a sci fi b movie of some sort how wrong i was the plot is enthralling and intelligent the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple i am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as i thought it was quite unusual if you liked the film se7en seven with brad pit or the matrix then you will like this there is no major special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all it is all about the plot about building the characters and building an atmosphere it is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may irk some people but i thought the ending was great i am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not
<START> now out of all the shark movies i've seen this one takes the cake the plot of the movie was good but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards antonio jr does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father a is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well the view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles but the effects were a blur and the scenes were a little weak in some places with the mini weapons there that would take out a whole school of sharks there it was great that the son would get the exact revenge on that monstrosity although it would indeed cost him his life as well like they say revenge has it's price but was it worth it that answer could go on and on and this movie was a major letdown the beginning was fine and at the end it went like the titanic 1 out of 5 stars
<START> this was a disgrace to the game farcry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare besides the bad acting the visual effects stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop the movie is not worth watching at all the funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time i hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday and i they will invest some good cash to get the visual effects right and the right as well as the acting right but till then don't waste time by trying to watch this movie because it will surely make you go mad specially if you are a farcry lover
<START> i really wanted to like this movie a film with zombie children getting out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror film unfortunately the film was in the bottom 3 of films played at horror fest br br a mother and her two daughters attempt to move on after her husband father had passed away from an illness that cost their family a lot of money they have to adapt to their new environment they end up struggling due to all the surroundings for different reasons crazy zombie kids go into this category the film never gives any sentimental attachment for anyone that lives or dies the film produces no scares or jump worthy moments the film barely shows the children doing what they're supposed to do kill with a bigger budget and a better cast this film could have hope until then pass on it br br 3 5 10 actually

<START> in the light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard that is typhoon i thought it upon myself to re watch black rain 1988 japan shohei imamura's haunting black and white masterpiece on the destruction and after effects of the atomic bomb that hit hiroshima in the closing period of the second world war the destruction and impact of both catastrophes war and typhoon may differ in degree and quality but the trauma and scar physically and psychologically nevertheless are still there br br it is a testament to a film's power that its images remain as potent and as indelible as when they were first seen it is only that the difference now in my case is that watching those images has assumed a greater sense of poignancy and potency due to a first hand experience of a near monumental weather calamity there is a sense of kinship so to speak br br imamura has always been one of my favorite japanese filmmakers his films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy sensuality and earthiness the introduction to anthropology 1966 1981 warm water under a red bridge 2001 his two palme d'or winners ballad of 1983 and the eel 1997 to name some given the mood of his films who would have thought that he once served as an assistant director to yasujiro ozu japanese cinema's most austere and minimalist filmmaker but then it is ozu's rigorous formality and domesticity that imamura was rebelling against br br but then again with black rain one can unmistakably sense ozu's imprints the father or the father figure being intent on seeing his daughter get married before time runs out on both of them and the stillness and calmness of the scenes showing all members of the family together notably the dinner scenes or in ozu's film lexicon the are something that the revered master filmmaker would explore in his works tokyo story late spring essentially the over all subdued and deliberate quality of black rain is a remarkable contrast to the chaos and instinctual drive of imamura's entire filmography br br still this is not to say that watching the film would not be an altogether unsettling experience black rain as aptly described by american film reviewer leonard maltin is filled with haunting black and white images in the film's first 15 minutes imamura pulls no punches in showing the immediate and graphic horrors of the nuclear bombing one after another stiffly burnt bodies hanging flesh walking dead fires and debris everywhere madness all over an assault to the viewers' senses definitely it is coupled with takashi somber b w photography he did the lensing in crime drama the incident and toru chilling score he did the music in such classics as akira kurosawa's ran and double suicide br br even during the film's supposed tranquil phase that is five years after the atomic bombing one can still never have a sense of contentment and order with the uneasiness and pain still being strongly felt by the survivors not only in terms of failing physical health but more so in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma the human race it now indisputably appears has been destined to bear the legacy of the bomb for as long as it lives br br i already wrote a piece about black rain some years earlier posted in imdb com but only in comparison to volker magnificent tin drum another film dealing with monumental human folly and global catastrophe moreover it has never been my practice to write twice about a film that i already wrote something about before it is in the light of the recent weather calamity that devastated our country that i was prompted to re visit and write something again about this remarkable imamura film as there is a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the film and the recent event in regards the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action and the long term scars and wounds inflicted by a wide scale destruction whether human or nature induced br br there have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction testament threads the war game each situated within their own respective countries and black rain stands among them if not more so for both its unapologetic and somber portrayal of individual and communal disintegration brought about by atomic devastation and the fact that it has a historical event as its basis br br few weeks from now another disaster film from hollywood roland 2012 will finally hit no pun intended the big screen as we all know this american director's bunch of disaster apocalypse films independence day godzilla the day after tomorrow serves no other purpose than to be of mere entertainment value with no real insight into the nature and wisdom of apocalyptic disaster and the human condition being affected i wonder how this gigantic movie would exploit the trauma disorientation and apprehensions still being experienced by our people because of the recent weather calamity to say that this flick is a precautionary tale would probably be no more than an overstatement br br but yes i will still watch 2012

<START> i always loved french movies because i think they are filled with much more emotion and sense than the americans this film is a gem br br starting with the wedding which is so funny that you just want to join them and in the end where the little family kids tell us who is with who which is extremly funny catherine deneuve is simply hot and so good that it is absolutely possible that a young man can fall in love with her and lindon is perfect for that role the best scene except the wedding party is in the family reunion where antoine has got mad and yells his feelings to lea in front of the family it is such a shame that i could buy this film only from the french and not from the english so i have to learn in french to enjoy watching it
