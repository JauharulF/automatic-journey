<START> i have bought the complete season of surface watched it in 3 days i was so captured by the the plot theories and basically everything about this show the actor who plays miles is great sister mother and father acted like real life family would you could connect on so many levels it's fascinating br br i find animals are so wonderful you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists br br am that surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows i have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book br br love the show very much for those who haven't watched surface if you like sci fi you need to watch this
<START> shadows is often acclaimed as the film that was the breakthrough for american independent cinema whether thats true or not it is an undeniably important film one whose influence can be traced all the way to today's sundance fodder here is a film which tackles controversial topics of the day namely racism and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative fashion also it deals with sex in a frank manner that hollywood wouldn't even discuss until the graduate br br still the question remains is it as powerful today as when it was originally released the answer is yes while many important films are hard to watch and dated nowadays shadows retains every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now it deals with racism as a personal issue and not a political one so its still relevant plus it works as a great time capsule capturing the 1950s beat generation and new york art scene in a way possibly no other film has br br on a technical level its admittedly uneven cassavetes had yet to gain full confidence as a director and the choppy editing reflects the film's low budget still the film's story is remains powerful plus the acting considering the inexperience of the cast and improvisational nature is phenomenal all around the actors create realistic characters ones who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions shadows is absolutely mandatory viewing for film buffs 9 10
<START> what alice found is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of i underestimated it when i heard of it and i though that it would all sex no plot and just really stupid but in reality it was really good they say all indie movies suck but this one and napoleon dynamite didn't suck i asked my friend who'd seen it before i did and she said that alice has all these three ways and you see all this nudity but no there is no three way that i remember and little nudity the movie did have a point and it taught me never trust hitchhikers i liked that in the end they got alice a little dolphin in the end on her way to flordia i totally suggest seeing this movie
<START> this one what came to my mind immediately was loving annabelle as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject we simply observe as the story unfolds without taking sides or having to confront any moral issues or of course we are but are not spoon fed them sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make but it just flowed basically it was just like any other love story in any other life with any other sexes br br i personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs the only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind of retained held back it's not about the sex scenes or those missing but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time it kind of contrasted with the rest is good but it just never quite like loving annabelle nor touched me quite as much br br this said i heartily recommend it it's by no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary br br 7 10
<START> the story of ed gein is interesting very interesting this movie however interesting only in the fact that it was actually made kane hodder's portrayal of ed gein is so far off it's not even the slightest bit funny ed gein did not behave psychotic in public he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everybody and talked to anybody who would listen this is one of the major things this movie failed to show the audience but the biggest mistake of this movie side from even one frame ever being shot was that ed never killed anyone without having been told to do so by his dead mother whom he thought was speaking to him from beyond the grave he killed only the people who his dead mother said he had to because it was god's will and he was very remorseful about it though that didn't stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing people's flesh i officially gave this movie a rating of 1 simply because 0 wasn't given to me as an option br br i highly advise all to stay clear of this movie if you want to see a movie that accurately depicts ed gein and doesn't try to put in a sub plot love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed i highly advise you see the original movie which unfortunately seems to not be on imdb com though i could be wrong but i have yet to find it here the original doesn't stray from the actual events and doesn't try to twist the story i can understand telling the story from a different perspective but this movie just tried to straight change the true story itself something that i find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on 9 11 but gave it a twist that canada was behind it or a wwii movie saying hitler was a good guy and helped fight the nazi's
<START> an wonderful film that works on several levels it's a story about a great architect a son seeking his father about very loving relationships and about loss it's also a great about architecture br br very intelligent and very moving a real treat
<START> in a critical scene as katharine clifton kristin scott thomas lies in the cave of swimmers she writes something read aloud by hana juliette binoche in which she proclaims that the light has gone out now and i'm writing in the darkness a sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome the english patient with such a dramatic sweep that keeps one firmly on their feet and a strength about the film that doesn't let up this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of world war ii taking elements of casablanca and lawrence of arabia along with some independence in the form of tuscany br br the english patient unabashedly pulls the heartstrings and takes us through a mysterious first act a romantic second act and a beautiful beautiful final act and it isn't just the wonderful pace and setting it's the performance of ralph fiennes who keeps us sympathetic even when count from the very start proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character usually typecast as a villain he shows tainted but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill br br many will criticize this film based on its so called glorification of but those who do know nothing the contrasts between the two periods before and after the plane crash seen at the start are spectacular as the patient is the regretting man who suffers because of what he did the evil that was once in him now absent whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else he wants this woman but he cannot have her fiennes brings the human like qualities out of in a way absolutely no other actor could there couldn't have been a better actor for the job br br so please take these comments to heart see the film those who call it boring or despicable know nothing and should be ashamed of such a one dimensional view on the film a view that they have neither studied nor corrected and probably don't plan on the english patient is the best of every film to have ever won the best picture oscar and for so many reasons hidden in their poetic triumphs
<START> while everyone does a decent job in this film i agree with the other comment it's too loose and scattered too much like a script less experiment with really talented actors as such it isn't enough to hold your attention having said that there are a few really funny moments one involving dylan mcdermott and a flaming shot glass that i think anyone who's been that drunk would find as funny as i did the other is a split second with an dinosaur crispin glover does his usual nutty twitch fest guy and does it fine harry dean stanton does his usual nutty patriarch repo man anyone etc good cast not enough to keep it going just a few gems seconds long
<START> my first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for 5 00 but since it featured sandra bullock who i generally like i bought it my disappointment with the film began almost immediately the dialogues are slow and stiff the color is distorted i kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations the acting is amateurish even the killing scenes are a failure twice dead people moved their legs when my cash deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie i immediately and joyfully complied this is an amazingly bad movie tomorrow i am giving this dvd away at the company white elephant christmas party
<START> the cast was well picked pauly shore is hilarious and does a good job of bringing the plot of the movie together however tiffani amber is who really makes this movie special her talented acting combined with her great looks makes this movie a definite see
<START> one of my favourite films whenever it is on although i do admit one time missing it when it was on last year br br despite the age of the film it doesn't look like that and the story even though it'd been done a thousand times before still felt entertaining there were one or two little niggles for me in the story but i looked past them and just enjoyed the film for what it was br br overall i give it a 7 10
<START> this film is on my top 20 comedies list this is a truly unique film to the reviewer who said i must be really missing something you are correct you are missing something if you don't have the kind of sense of humor this film requires that's one thing but don't give it a bad review because you think it's looney but isn't intended to be loony is an apt description of both what it intends to be and what it succeeds in being i laughed much more often and much more intensely at this film than i do at most other funny films br br michael almereyda brought out the best in his cast in this his first big film for which he was nominated for an independent spirit award for best first feature crispin glover as usual is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way and some of his very funniest lines ever were said in this film glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now harry dean stanton puts in an excellent comic performance william burroughs is incredible in a small role dylan mcdermott was ideally cast and lois chiles is completely excellent br br all of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way but this is one of crispin's finest performances up there with his performances in river's edge and willard if you are a crispin glover fan but have somehow overlooked this film you need to stop whatever it is you're doing and see this immediately br br but just remember to relax first and maybe have a beer or something this is a great film but it is very unusual and i recommend being in or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before viewing
<START> this is a romantic comedy so it's really a fairy tale but an unconventional one cinderella rather than living in the ashes lives in an castle in the suburbs with a good looking husband who's no prince she does find her prince but he's not that handsome instead of a castle at least initially she gets a tiny walk up in manhattan br br stockwell and ruehl lead a cast of fully realized if a little over the top characters br br demme reaches the highest level of movie making in my mind he creates a world i want to move into a manhattan neighborhood and street life teeming with life and community br br i wish imdb linked to reviewers' other comments i'd like to know what other movies the people who panned this one hate i am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to live at least for an hour or so
<START> this movie is almost never seen today the only reason i can enjoy it again and again is from a slightly worn out vhs copy i made when the film was shown on tv in 1991 here in england br br an ensemble cast are obviously enjoying themselves and this is reflected to the viewer a razor sharp script helps things along and once you've seen this you will want to watch it over and over again br br wayne rogers is the 'star' but everyone contributes to a great film with a great jazz soundtrack to boot there are emotional moments during the film but never to the point of sickly sweet sentimentalism these are guys on the trip of a lifetime and they convey that excitement wonderfully br br highly recommended if you can actually get to see it
<START> just lovely it is long no climax don't wait for anything to happen great for a rainy day about a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the greek isles i saw this in my teens and still love it 20 years later i have been unable to find it in video stores however molly ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place there are no phones no tv boredom which when hit with quietness like that the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect and each character does so susan sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with john cassavetes' character but he is unable to well you know gina rowlands is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage he is demanding and frustrating to everyone there is another character in the movie a greek who talks to molly ringwald inappropriately about sex but things that she is curious about but he is irritating and horny and i didn't like this character the locale of the film is what makes this film so so good it wouldn't work if filmed anywhere else i recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10
