<START> i think that is one of the best russians minis for teens i think i were near 6 8 parts of the movie one boy form 6th grade found a time machine in the old house where nobody lived and he goes to the 21st century just 100 years in future in future he meat pirates they tried to steal a machine to read minds and a story started soundtrack for that movie was very popular in soviet union everybody loved that movie which was on tv every year
<START> chip is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects are truly amazing the co hosts do a good job i particularly enjoy watching the project come together the end results are much better than when they came off the assembly line what with the mechanical and cosmetic advances of today however i do get annoyed somewhat at the fact the projects seem to be the property of the already rich and or famous it's too bad the ones getting overhauled can afford the undertaking let's see now vince neill of motley crew gets a car make over for his buddy hello if he neill were a true friend he would have paid to have his friend's car restored what a joke another episode shows a middle aged seemingly well to do gal getting her '56 caddy named betsy done the husband of 30 years was behind it all the couple looked like money was not in short supply what a shame i guess the lunch pail guys like me will have to save for the day that will never come i happen to own a ford project chip will somebody pick me
<START> for what it's worth this is a fairly decent road runner cartoon if a little short just under 6 minutes the gags are adequate at best the animation is competent and the new restored dvd master looks nice however that's where the qualities end allow me to provide a little backstory in 1958 thanks to a labour dispute wb got hold of a bunch of canned music that would be used in 6 of the year's cartoons br br there is only one phrase to describe this short's music and that is it has the 4kids sound i use that phrase to describe music which has absolutely no correspondence to the on screen action and feels like it was recorded by an orchestra consisting of members of a sonic youth cover band the music in this short feels hopelessly tacked on and incredibly obnoxious especially considering there are scenes in this short namely the piano trap that would have worked best with little or no music br br i didn't think a wb cartoon would be ruined by awful music even scores aren't this obnoxious but considering the cartoon isn't that notable anyway it becomes almost painful to watch with the music it's kind of like how late 80's episodes of doctor who could be bad anyway and yet be made unwatchable thanks to unbelievably awful music which sounded like he hit the demo button on all 5 of his casio keyboards at the same time br br i am going to have people call me crazy for this but i'd easily watch one of rr cartoons over this at least the canned music was usually in sync with the action on those
<START> the production year says it all the movie is a marauding mess of politically correct feministic drivel of a so heavyhanded symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today every scene has the purpose of shedding light on one of the burning issues of society mainly the role of females in the working community the role of women vs men women as sex objects consumerism politics war etc every scene is commented upon by the inner dialogue of one of the main actresses or by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke i have no reminiscence of any plot or who the main characters actually were it is the sort of movie where consumerism is mocked by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers his speech or where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a striptease act for of course the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience then we move swiftly on as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the male blowing of cars horns or rioting crowds and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of stalin and all the other usual suspects you get the idea but all this does not matter at all the movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any male ingmar bergman aficionado a movie boasting leads bibi harriet and at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel Â and also delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie i had never heard about before today it is hard to believe how especially the face of bibi owns the screen every single time she appears the cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated bw often revelling in an overexposed dimensionless and you just never grow tired of watching the performers how absurd that a movie made with so much consideration for the feministic agenda tirelessly advocating that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire has nothing better to offer the 21st century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes as mentioned i am not complaining i could rewatch it tomorrow
<START> closet land tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements you could read lots of stuff about the movie's plot before hand but you don't really need to all you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation along the way we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated we also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place especially when you have absolutely no control over it br br in the end the movie amounts to a warning really though the movie has several different aspects to it about what happens to people's freedoms when they look the other way and ignore injustices happening to those around them br br if you've got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this i strongly recommend that you do so
<START> i rented this movie with very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised this movie is extremely good stuff and one would never guess it was low budget br br eighteen directed by bell' centers around an 18 year old named pip played by the superb who leaves his home because of the circumstances surrounding the way his older brother died he is overcome with guilt by this event and falls into a hard life of a runaway teen on drugs and alcohol on his 18th birthday his father tracks pip down and gives him a tape left for him by his grandfather of which he was to listen to on his 18th birthday br br the way the whole film is told is with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time the present life of pip and the past life of his grandfather during ww11 of which pip listens to on the tape br br the three outstanding performances in this movie are the ones from as pip and playing jason the young 18 year ww11 soldier his grandfather also the role of the ww11 wounded medic played by hildreth ' all putting in fine performances br br a couple of concerns and scenes that didn't sit too well with me the priest father chris played by 'alan who is gay and in broad daylight up the local street hustler the whole neighborhood knows about and then we have the local store clerk named jeff a sweetheart played by the attractive 'david who just wants to be loved and for some unknown reason is attracted to the very unattractive and sleaze ball street hustler clerk who sleeps with just about anyone and in all likelihood is a walking toxic time bomb on top of all that he's not a very likable person this part just didn't ring true br br the parts i really like the most was the flashbacks to the war they were so well acted and very touching there is a scene at the end where the one soldier is dying and the other soldier is there for him to comfort and show him love as he lays badly injured and dying this is such a wonderful and touching scene it left me in tears beautifully acted br br i highly recommend this movie it is one of love redemption and the power of the human spirit to survive
<START> let me first start with the obvious has been a serious problem throughout history present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of jews that said the problem with this movie is that it views the united states probably the most welcoming society ever to jews outside of israel as a not very different place from nazi germany set in 1943 the movie is about a man william h macy who gets confused with a jew after he starts wearing glasses a number of very nasty things happen to him after that he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one his neighbors shunned him all ending up in a violent confrontation from one of arthur miller's self pitying patronizing novels the sort that gave liberalism a bad name
<START> some funny lines are all what makes this movie bearable the camera tv movie like the acting poor julie davis is more than and the directing amateurish and or loveless but i can understand that no one had fun to realise the and trivial script
<START> the best so bad it's good movie ever made rudy ray moore is my personal hero whether dealing with day to day life or pimping ho's down the block i can always look to him for inspiration and guidance when it comes to blaxploitation the man nobody is meaner watch dolemite as he and his army of all female kung fu killers take down mr big and willie green awesome plot huh there are so many one liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary if you say a couple of lines from dolemite you are instantly cool if you are in the mood for a laugh riot rent this movie also check out the human tornado disco godfather and petey the devil's son in law now can you dig that br br you no business barring insecure rat soup eating '
<START> i can't believe i watched this whole movie another ishtar in that i kept waiting for it to get better which never happened the sound is terrible going from too low to hear the conversations to blaring sound in seconds the plot is absolutely implausible the acting is mediocre although keaton does his usual good job as a mental case although being typecast in that role could certainly be considered a negative the director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals medications science or anything of a technical nature sociopath i wonder how they came up with that diagnosis there are so many errors goofs and things wrong with this movie that if one were to list them all it would possibly set some kind of record as a general a motorcyclist on the freeway wearing a non dot off road helmet san francisco paper walls move when tapped helmets just appear out of thin air guns point one direction but hit things in another lighting appears and disappears and there is barely a scene in the move that doesn't contain some kind of error my wife who is an rn in an unit finally left the room before the end of the movie so upset over all the medical errors i gave it a 2 only because of keaton's acting else it certainly would have gotten a 1
<START> this is the third movie in a month i have watched that did not go the way i expected the first two being the black dahlia and hollywoodland neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes br br i have always had a fascination with ufos and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of ufo investigation that was not a comedy but after about 30 minutes it all went horribly wrong br br i could have stood for the acting the camera angles the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing ufos but none here i am not saying there was anything wrong with the subject matter but netflix pushed this movie as a ufo skeptic and a ufo believer investigating multiple br br i stopped watching about half way thru can't believe i wasted that much time with this one please don't make the same mistake i did
<START> if you're not a fan of the 80s and you need to be a particularly strong fan or of one of the two leads there's nothing about this film to recommend br br the story as others have said is dull almost an afterthought to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy i watched it to about an hour hoping it would turn a corner a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no it's not unwatchable it's just dull it goes by it goes by with bits of running around madly lingering shots of feet at strange angles bits of shouting madly but i didn't get a real feel of energy or manic fun it just came across as forced needless to say also there was nothing to laugh at particularly a bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing more br br don't be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female if anything it's actually cloying two female leads fine excellent the drug dealer is female okay their landlord is a landlady alright their friends are female okay the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building oh female i wasn't on the lookout for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt again a bit forced and cloying br br on the plus side if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture there is plenty to see and if you're a fan of helen slater she's fun and enjoyable to watch there's also some screen time for carol kane which is great but not enough br br overall 3 10 if you're a huge fan of the 80s helen slater and carol kane you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them although there's still the fact it's a comedy which isn't funny which hinders it substantially if you're not a fan of those things you might as well make it 0 because there's nothing much else to enjoy here
<START> this was truly a heart warming movie it is filled with so many messages loyalty friendship sickness death and the paranoia society has concerning anything they don't understand i have shed a few tears during certain movies but this movie kept the tears flowing
<START> the review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent no you shouldn't there are spoilers at the end of this review but how i can spoil this rotten movie i have no idea even if you are a die hard alien fan like i am wait for the dvd it isn't worth a 3 99 rental either but you'll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theater br br in the theater i watched there were exactly two laughs both by a girl sitting next to me other than that there was total silence throughout no or that was bad ass nothing imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic now you know what you'll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of br br what was the budget on this movie like war of the worlds mi 3 and other f x driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the cgi people can come up with than developing characters or a plot spielberg has tried and failed at this several times usually with tom cruise sure the movies make money but should they war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for a decent script tom cruise et al and ss himself but were still awful i'm sure wasted 90 of their budget on cg and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random br br there is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised who cares who gets killed we didn't know any of them we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit we all know the blood is acid in alien aliens 3 resurrection and even the directors make use of the fact that the aliens can think can hide and can lay traps this director decided that the ridley scott james cameron and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed in this installment you will never care who lives or dies not a kid a parent a pregnant woman the characters serve only one purpose in this movie to die the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke the character development scenes mix clichÃ©s bad humor and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways but they don't the director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the alien franchise but only succeeded in the good parts of the first films the human protagonists and stealing the rest from other recent sci fi films br br there is not one original use of the either the alien or characters the actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that revered the aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as rite of passage the is never really developed as a fearsome creature its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was hellboy where dismembered tongue injected eggs into hellboy or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victim's throat br br simply put we aren't given reason to care about anything in this movie there is violence but it doesn't shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn't been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren't made to care whether or not kids women or anyone else lives or dies we just want the movie to end eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil 2 has a nuke aim way to wipe out the infection and not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it in a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last br br sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating bad script no plot unoriginal action scenes uninspired direction abysmal acting decent f x that were wasted because of the many flaws br br i don't mind going to an indie film and being disappointed the actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget for a movie with this type of budget and hype i feel cheated along with disappointed this movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits sad to say that a preview of hellboy 2 was the best part of and didn't even look that good
<START> prepare to meet your messiah they call him thrust male role models have become increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed society every other day an apparent role model is forced to tearfully apologize for a youthful indiscretion or he innocently gets a few youngsters drunk on his ranch the last dinosaur is the story of the last great hunt of thrust an old grizzled big game hunter who serves as role model supreme despite his haggard features and bulbous nose the females including joan van ark are attracted to him like meatloaf is to cheesy lyrics thrust is openly sexist and makes no apologies for his elaborate lifestyle which includes a red kerchief and a private jet with a working fireplace br br thrust embarks on a mission to find and hunt the last dinosaur on earth when ironically after a rich full life he is truly the last dinosaur despite his propensity for yelling at everyone in his presence his employees and lady friends are unwaveringly loyal to him he may act as though he's perpetually drunk but make no mistake if he calls you a you are a br br not to be denied his own ballad song shamelessly praises him and his manliness a sampling of lyrics includes few men have ever done what he has done or even dreamed what he has dreamed few men have even tried what he has tried most men have failed where he's prevailed the world holds nothing new in store for him and things that startle you and me are just a bore to him few men have ever lived as he has lived or even walked where he has even banned artist clay aiken could belt out those lyrics and become an rump kicking machine br br thrust and his crew of scientists strap themselves into the wearing mini bike helmets though thrust affords himself the luxury of the red kerchief around his neck the giant human filled drill bit digs through the earth and ice to come popping out into a lagoon dinosaurs from the air and land soon descend upon the scientists forcing thrust and crew to run for their lives after narrowly escaping a charging dino lays back and blasts out a hearty laugh not so much to celebrate life but to acknowledge 'the game is br br soon after it is little surprise that we see a few slightly hunched over cavemen sneaking peeks at their visitors thrust not content with simply killing a dinosaur decides then to make it his mission to bag a cave broad throughout the movie the lone t rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain the size of a peanut despite its enormous size the local t rex is able to up next to its victims virtually unnoticed with the element of surprise t rex simply crushes a scientist or two and the campsite every so often the bloated and faced thrust is seen yelling at someone shooting at something or flirting with a primitive j lo in manly fashion br br thrust is like james kirk not only in his addiction to love but also when is comes to making complicated weapons using limited natural resources in a short period of time thrust and the remaining crew members construct a highly accurate catapult that flings a large boulder into the skull of the cunning t rex upon realizing that even he thrust cannot top this addition to his trophy case thrust decides to stay in his prehistoric surroundings the ever dwindling crew then leaves thrust to live out his days with his lovely although a bit gamely cavewoman and introduce her to his personal collection of stds this is only a brief synopsis of a movie so complicated and rich in tradition that it takes several viewings to absorb its message and realize that thrust is the answer the press conference complete with a yelling thrust mumbling reporters and the introduction of the great is a classic moment also look for a body resembling a dead ricky schroeder lying on some logs and the most powerful use of someone being called a in cinematic history
