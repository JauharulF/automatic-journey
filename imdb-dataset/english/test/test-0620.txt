<START> first separate the story from the film the story about a second continuing war in heaven is good very good religious themed films aren't the main choice for a lot of people but angels at war is i really loved the story and some of the imagery provided to back it up like the field of angels on spikes awesome imagery the actual film though was just poor i can't find any reason for the main character the priest cum cop being in there at all the lead female also no reason to be there the main characters dialogue was just empty it had no substance the story could have been told well without them now some sterling performances did feature walken stoltz and mortensen pulled off some wingers though their scenes were mostly with the lifeless leads br br one other thing i am not getting from this film is why it features native american rituals to purge the dark soul the child that carries it is clearly of native american origin but apart from the end scenario there is nothing that connects here with that heritage the plot concerning the dark soul itself it barely told odd considering that the dark soul is the driver for the whole premise of the film the back story of its original owner the colonel is briefly touched but not enough to allow understanding as to why its his soul that is the special one br br i cannot find a justification for the scrolling scenery shots in this film either several of the plains around rock' i get the feeling they had a helicopter and wanted to make the most of it as none of the shots have any relevance nor are they in keeping with the mood horror the film falls into the sci fi category more than it does horror there was no real shock or scare scenes some mild gore and blood but no fear element br br so aside from 3 roles played damn well this film is a big ole' dud unfortunately the dud factor outweighs the good acting factor just too many weekend actors
<START> this is a movie that will brighten up your day for sure kermit the frog is just an ordinary frog in his swamp when a talent agent stops by and tells him that hollywood is looking for frogs to be in movie lol on the way kermit meets fozzie bear miss piggy gonzo and his chicken camilla rowlf the electric mayhem bunsen and beaker but also trailing kermit is the proprietor of a restaurant chain doc hoppers french fried frog legs all things considered though kermit and the muppets make it to hollywood br br this movie is recommended for everyone young and old br br it has some wonderful musical numbers like the rainbow connection i'm going to go back there someday and movin' right along the muppets also use many forms of transportation in this movie kermit rides a bike fozzie drives a and another car gonzo takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons which is one of my favorite moments by the way and kermit and the rest of the muppets finally go the rest of the way by the electric bus dr teeth floyd janice scooter and animal who meet up with them in the desert after car breaks down br br even some sesame street muppets make cameo appearances i e big bird is walking along on the road on the way to nyc to break into public television the end is also a very heartwarming moment every single muppet created is in the final scene along with a final rainbow connection reprise br br but those poor muppets worked so hard on their movie set then it all comes crashing down and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks you'd think everything is ruined and destroyed but the rainbow comes shining through the roof at the end and it all sums up the magic of this film and you know everything will be all right br br perfect 10 10 watch it and you'll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie
<START> bring back the a team was a hour long special screened on channel 4 in the uk of last year and hosted by presenter and comedian justin lee collins the show attempted to track down and reunite the fellow cast members of the a team together for the first time ever on tv this has been something which has never been attempted before by anyone well not by anyone that i know of that is br br justin makes a great presenter and his eccentric personality and humorous banter shone throughout this programme the attempts he makes in getting hold of the cast members is ever so funny but also he was very persistent and eager to fulfil this task too which is a credit to him i'd say mind you he is great on tv anyway be it by presenting a show such as this or the friday night project with his co host alan carr br br there were appearances and interviews with dirk benedict the himself dwight schultz aka howling mad murdock marla who played baker jack ging aka general full bright the creator of the a team stephen j cannell and the big man himself mr t aka ba they were just fascinating to watch and hear what they had to say about the programme that became a global hit during the 80s as they reminisce and relive the good and bad moments of the show both during and behind the scenes unfortunately no george peppard but of course he is already in heaven understandably and strangely enough no melinda who played amy br br i just didn't understand why she wasn't featured in the show okay she was axed after 3 seasons or whatever but she was the first and original female member of the a team only to be replaced and so it would've been great to see and hear her side to the a team story in addition to the other cast members br br all in all bring back the a team was a great documentary style of show perhaps this could've been spread out more by means of which this could've been a six part documentary but nonetheless this was a great effort on the part of recommended
<START> i can't stand people who comment on this program or other hbo programs as too graphic or unnecessarily graphic or that they contain gratuitous nudity violence sodomy etc br br guess what prison life isn't pg 13 the gratuitous graphic content is true to life of this situation prison contains inmate rape killings drug deals and showers if you don't like it then don't watch the program i'm certainly no fan of prison rape but if it was left out of the show i'd be surprised and lend the show less credibility if the prisoners didn't curse it would just be silly sure it's gratuitous language but that is realistic br br the show is good some of the viewers not so much i guess
<START> if you read the book by carl the movie follows pretty much true to form with a few minor changes for hollywood in my opinion this is a great family movie luke wilson officer pretty well steals the show from an all star cast that includes robert wagner and jimmy buffet the kids in the movie do a great job led by logan lerman brie larson and cody br br brie larson is maybe a little too petite to play beatrice i pictured a bigger girl maybe 6 foot 175 lbs in the role of beatrice this might have made her more believable in her role of beating up dana they should have developed her tough girl character more and had her bite through a tire or kick a soccer ball through a person she is very pretty and i understand why she was cast she is a box office attraction br br this is about as pg as a movie gets these days no sex and very little violence this movie is a come true a movie with a strong environmental message with kids that have deep appreciation for the beauty of florida and its wildlife it shows how adults have fallen short in the stewardship of our planet and that our children can demand better one of my favorite lines in the movie is when mullet fingers says florida could use some mountains like montana florida is so flat there is nothing to stop developers from clearing it coast to coast also the photography of florida wildlife spoke volumes without dialog as a family movie with kids ages 5 15 this is a great movie as a bonus parents' will be entertained especially if they're
<START> michael myers the deranged not so young anymore psycho who seems to get with every appearance is resurrected by his druid brothers to wreck more menace upon his family members and any one else who gets in the way gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count michael who originally preferred strangulations and kitchen knives learns to swing an axe and use whatever means necessary to off his victims and the result is an awful patchwork dollar store film virtually by a few genuinely creepy sequences donald pleasance who died shortly after production seems to have been injected into this story simply so somebody could be billed as the star you won't want to cover your eyes during this one but you will shake your head at the downward slide of john carpenter's classic creation
<START> i caught up with this movie on tv after 30 years or more several aspects of the film stood out even when viewing it so many years after it was made br br the story by the little known c virgil is remarkable almost resembling a tolstoy like story of a man buffeted by a cosmic scheme that he cannot comprehend compare this film with better known contemporary works such as schindler's list and you begin to realize the trauma of the world war ii should be seen against the larger canvas of racism beyond the simplistic nazi notion of aryan vs jews this film touches on the hungarians dislike for the romanians the romanians dislike of the russians and so on even touching on the jews' questionable relationships with their christian romanian friends while under stress br br as i have not read the book it is difficult to see how much has been changed by the director and screenplay writers for instance it is interesting to study the romanian view of to usa with the view of making money only to return to romania and invest his earnings there br br in my opinion the character of moritz was probably one of the finest roles played by anthony quinn ranking alongside his work in la strada zorba the greek and br br the finest and most memorable sequence in the film is the final one with anthony quinn and trying to smile the father carrying a daughter born out his wife's rape by russians is a story in itself but the director is able to show the reconciliation by a simple gesture the act of carrying the child without slipping into melodramatic footage br br today after the death of princess diana we often remark about the insensitive paparazzi the final sequence is an indictment of the paparazzi and the insensitive media director verneuil also makes a similar comment during the court scene as the cameramen get ready to pounce on moritz br br the interaction between church and state was so beautifully summed up in the orthodox priest's laconic statement i pray to god that he guides those who have power to use them well br br some of the brief shots such as those of a secretary of a minister doodling while listening to a petition said so much in so little footage the direction was so impressive that the editing takes a back seat br br finally what struck me most was the exquisite rich texture of colors provided by the cameraman andreas winding from the brilliant credit sequences to the end i recalled that he was the cameraman of another favorite french film of mine called of clay directed by jean louis i have not seen such use of colors in a long while save for the david lean epics br br there were flaws i wish character was more fleshed out i could never quite understand the serge character the only intellectual in the entire film the railroad station scene at the end seems to be lifted out of sergio leone westerns finally the film was essentially built around a love story that unfortunately takes a back seat br br to sum up this film impressed me in more departments than one the story is relevant today as it was when it was made
<START> this scene shows how wallace's experiment by using his brain manipulation invention goes terribly wrong creating the were rabbit his desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better therefore created a brain manipulator machine he risked his own life to help solve rabbit problem and more importantly to overcome the overcrowding of rabbits being collected and stored in his basement though he thought his experiment worked however it resulted in placing more pressure on him and gromit to find a solution before the annual vegetable competition again risking his life gromit who is a silent faithful dog and a loyal helper finds himself continuously thinking of innovative ways to save his master from his radical crazy inventions going terribly wrong what is interesting in this movie is trying to identify who is more entrepreneurial wallace or gromit
<START> i don't play video games at all but my children do br br i got a big kick out of this would like to see more of this type of film very cool as my youngest would say br br interesting characters and the overall story line was interesting like i said i don't play video games but i think that my children would enjoyed this it was not full of bad language and that is a pleasant change this visual concept was different which caught my eye plus the sound track was pretty good i might even try out some of the games my sons plays to see because of this film who knows maybe i'll be a gamer someday
<START> found this film in a dvd discount rack for 10 it wasn't worth it some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student sandra's performance was somewhat credible but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and dragged br br one thing that i will give them however unlike most action films people in this film actually ran out of ammo and dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition
<START> i'm no slouch at finding redeeming social value whatever book or film people want to suppress from huck finn heart of darkness to i don't know deep throat or the latest hostage beheading i sincerely wish they wouldn't i'm not a lover of porn or of violence as entertainment but what of them i chance upon i tend to see camera angles cuts pans lighting rhythms nearly to the exclusion of fear or titillation sometimes even missing filmmakers' or actors' intent even from footage that reasonable people may argue should never have existed i always imagine there's something to learn i wonder more at how a film does than about what it does maybe that's wrong of me wiser but harder than deconstructing unpleasant cinema might be to see cuts pans etc at one with and inseparable from no matter what content i ask myself what horror filmmakers and church architects have in common add in political filmmakers fascist and not all manipulate with light space and sound in order to alter perception and mood how different are their goals how different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda br br when the original all night long trilogy appeared on my shelf i left it unwatched for nearly year curiosity had made me buy it i sampled a few minutes of 1 the day it arrived up to the awkwardly sound effected street corner stabbing that seems really an attack on film viewers' sensibility found it inept but effective i'd have to come back to it certainly but didn't relish the prospect clearly this wasn't the sublime horror of kairo cure angel dust lain the rawer but still traditionally framed horror of the first evil dead trap the overtly political work of koji or even the brilliant crudity of early cronenberg br br maybe that word attack is key attacks not his characters but his viewers i can't watch these at this point in history without thinking of both abu some of which i think i recall was evidenced on video and the hostage videos but also about godard's torturers in le petit to whom atrocity is just a job a fraction of a person's workday and then there's the prolonged northern california news story whose details i barely remember but can't entirely forget because it too entails cinema a duo of serial killers notorious if suggestion isn't playing games with my memory for having videotaped themselves torturing victims br br all three entries are revenge cinema vigilante exercises but i'm attaching these notes because it's the most ambitious and may constitute a turning point for director i haven't seen the entries that followed through the first two offerings i imagined a camera fallen into the hands of one of those fringe kids from middle or grammar school who obsessively draw war scenes or other atrocities or as if one of revenge crazed characters had turned writer director anyone watching these who hasn't seen michael powell's peeping tom would do well to see it but seems to aspire to mainstream protagonist grows carnivorous plants allowing for some typically japanese cool close up nature shots there's also for the first time a film a traditionally erotic sequence female boss sneaks up and begins to caress him while he's peeping at the love hotel's customers finds himself unhappily sandwiched between he's a voyeur the brief thrill comes from the layers of voyeurism there's even a philosophical poetic garbage a garbage voyeur who somehow makes me think of the poem repeated in not at all what it sounds like go go virgin br br i'm getting nowhere with this and it's getting in the way of my commenting other films can't escape the suspicion that a few years on i'll walk into a retrospective at my local film archive maybe hosted by some learned character who's caught onto something i'm missing br br how much does it matter whether the director is or simply gets his lethally muddled protagonists does he even have to understand them maybe a director's job is just to spew it out then let critics and the rest of us hash things out maybe directorial or artistic responsibility is a bogus notion br br my final struggle with this thing had me wondering what on earth a woman thinks watching these overwhelmingly male exercises we put women through this over and over from star wars to et cetera and et cetera and on and on and on and on but is anything quite as male skewed as the all night longs
<START> jack frost 2 the worst horror film i have ever seen why 1 the premise is well beyond ridiculous 2 the damn thing doesn't even have legs to move on 3 it escapes after being completely submerged in anti freeze first film 4 get this it travels all the way across an ocean of salt water to a tropical island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film 5 killer snowballs i have yet to be drunk enough to see ginger dead man so as of the writing of this jack frost 2 hold the distinction of being the stupidest horror film ever even surpassing the of it's predecessor if you can believe that
<START> i don't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy and maybe i will in the future after seeing return to me the plot was simple and no secret after the publicity you don't have to be einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes what you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the chemistry abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time i love this movie and have the dvd on order
<START> just another showcase of led zeppelin at their finest and their absolute rocking best every band member is at their best jimmy page and his bow and guitar with his thunderous bass bozo pounding away and robert singing like theirs no tomorrow i have to say when we get into the first song where gonna groove it is the beginning of something very special this dvd follows zeppelin through their 11 year starting in 69 in the royal albert hall then madison square garden 73 followed by a much older and mature band in 75 at earls court and finally a different looking band at their last english show at in 79 this dvd is fantastic showcase of zeppelin and if your not a fan you will be after n
<START> i have spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and most recently find myself working for the company that made this movie which is a real pity because i like these folks i just can't believe anyone could possibly make anything as bad as this this was crap from every possible angle from camera work to dialogue to acting to costumes and production design was one of the worst films i have ever seen the actors in this film looked like they had been taken straight off of a porn that was being shot in the san fernando valley and put on a set with an even less talented crew br br i just can't get over the fact that i am sitting on some of the best material i have ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have hit every roadblock possible yet the folks behind this spectacle of a film have no problems putting it together and in fact sleep well after it is released br br life what a trip
