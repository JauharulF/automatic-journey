<START> jack frost 2 is out of the question i'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies br br as sam and his wife take to the for a relaxing christmas jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding br br don't take a at this film at all most people say its a laugh with your mates but its a waste of time if the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story especially the cheesy character names
<START> you don't have to be a notre dame football fan to enjoy this because i am not but as a football fan in general this was fun to watch it almost makes me a fighting irish devotee if you can't get caught up in the emotion in this film gridiron fan or not you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes br br as a sports fan i loved watching the classic footage of early college games they had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of they interspersed that footage with pat o'brien shown as head coach on the sidelines and some of the players such as george ronald reagan br br reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isn't that large o'brien is the only actor with a large role in here the rest all playing nice characters include gale page as wife bonnie donald crisp as the notre father john callahan albert as chemistry professor father and reagan as perhaps notre most talented and famous player ever br br what this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football neither angle is overdone the characters in here all people you can root for as there are no villains on my last look it was interesting to discover johnny sheffield tarzan's son playing at the age of seven and to see george reeves tv's superman as one of the players br br there have been very few football movies made in hollywood for some reason and precious few good ones this is one of them
<START> absolutely nothing the movies that are great in this world are not recognized unless they are filled with gunshots explosions and death this movie is filled with a man talking about showing you a more complex character than has been seen in many movies br br when a movie is incredibly fast paced but stays mostly in one location it has to be the work of a genius surprisingly enough it is this movie is directed by oliver stone and therefore is one of the best directed films of our time br br this movie's screenplay was co written by oliver stone and eric bogosian barry main character with oliver stone's help the screenplay was created as a seamless rolling script which keeps you interested the entire time if you have any amount of intelligence if you have an open mind about any subjects and the wit to comprehend others then this movie is something which you should find some way to watch immediately
<START> in case you dear readers never heard this movie was the main inspiration for last year's samuel l jackson eugene levy clunker the man this 80s drenched buddy action comedy pairs short 'n billy crystal and the late ethiopian shim gregory hines together as some witty chi town cops who don't play by the rules that's pretty much the extent of the movie interest is somewhat peaked by hines' line delivery that is spookily similar to will smith's and by cameos of now more famous actors like joe pantoliano and nypd blue's jimmy my favorite scene is i dunno the car chase on the tracks i guess basically i just view this movie as a major helping hand in the demolition of action buddy flicks well this and lethal weapon 4 and rush hour 2 and the man
<START> hello all i went to this movie without any expectation though i knew would've given an excellent film i was stunned the backdrop is the struggle between the settled in sri lanka and the government the story is about how an young girl who lives with her foster parents at chennai india leaves to sri lanka in search of her real mother the high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse the cinematography editing and all other technical details full marks to the cast and crew i have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there excellent work though the war sequences reminded me of saving private ryan such a work was never attempted on indian screen overall the movie is great and hats off to mr br br mani has once again proved that he is a director who can take indian cinema to great heights i would love to watch this film again and again an excellent film and a must see
<START> i felt that the movie directed by ingmar bergman was very dry it shows the things people will do to survive during a war and the shame that comes out of these actions however i feel that it was not complete or attention holding he never fully got into the plot or deep into the character emotions or reasons behind their actions the only thing that i found rather attention holding in the movie was the transformation of the two main characters jan and eva many times during the movie was just the two main characters sitting around or doing their daily chores and not even having a conversation i understand this was to show the reality of these people however i feel there are other ways to show reality and have it be entertaining i think that ingmar bergman could have filmed this movie in a more riveting way
<START> well the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion yes chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some butt in this film but it is rather slow and the acting in my opinion is for the most part subpar although i think steve james does a decent job like my friend ryan i was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theatre at the end of the film rather than to go after norris's girlfriend until than the killer had only killed women oh well i guess it wasn't as predictable as i thought definitly a film you can pass on
<START> after an intriguing start this little drama quickly descends into the ranks of sheer mediocrity the start of the movie sees two women heather graham and natasha gregson wagner meet each other while waiting for their boyfriends to get home from their holidays natasha gregson wagner is a lovely looking actress and she plays louise a cute girl whose beloved boyfriend is an all round entertainer music movies you name it he does it while she's telling the other girl carla heather graham all about her wonderful boyfriend it soon becomes apparent that the similarities between their two male friends are too much and it's obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy oh dear enter robert downey jnr the sleaze bag that has two girlfriends while some poor guy somewhere has to go without one downey plays the sort of guy that the ladies like but men find repulsively annoying he is basically a mummy's boy the worst kind too on the phone ringing mother all the time continually showering his girlfriends with ambitious albeit empty promises etc it's enough to make a normal guy sick br br the film knowingly rips off superior three way love triangle films such as jules et jim this film doesn't work though mostly due to the fact that it's story is so unbelievable seriously if two women had just found that they were dating the same guy they wouldn't stick around to talk about it another reason why it falls down is that it's just so turgid there's no end of possibilities for the outcome of the situation that this movie presents especially with the claustrophobia of setting it all in a small apartment but all the movie does is get lost in masses of dialogue badly written and poorly delivered dialogue that is the film is also massively overacted it just isn't believable that people would act like they do in this film after finding themselves in this situation robert downey jnr is one of the many things that is wasted in the film with natural born killers he proved that he could give brilliantly entertaining performances and that is something that this movie could do with the two females aren't wasted because nobody expected anything from them anyway but downey could definitely have been better utilised overall a waste of time don't bother see jules et jim or natural born killers instead that's my advice
<START> having watched the first scene i realized the acting was so bad that it couldn't possibly pick up later superficial and artificial with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology the way a five year old tries to make it sound as if he knows what he's talking about br br the second to second storyline is completely unrealistic and just about every single decision the screenwriter did was the kind you expect from a below average grade school student the overall storyline was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages the few attempts to make the dialogs sound intelligent was limited to neurotic apologetic behavior a ten year old might like it but it would take a five year old to accept the lack of realism how does advanced cell function allow someone to bypass a code lock by touching it as if with a magic wand pick out one out of 100s of voices through a ventilation system thereby ripping off superman and repair a home computer by just sensing whats wrong instead of looking for faults actually that scene is a neat example the fault was that one of the cooling pipes aluminum ribbons on the was broken the way it would look if a exhaust pipe on a engine is ripped off by an explosion this is something that can't happen and if it did it wouldn't prevent the computer from working there is no electrical current passing through this ribbon but when he without doing it himself his arms worked by autopilot because the cells in his body was super efficient put a push pin into the rip a desktop with icons appeared on the screen immediately without booting br br and so it goes all the way like when he escaped an interrogation room in the nsa headquarters by lighting a lighter below a fire resulting in open doors throughout the building naturally nsa didn't predict this sharp witted approach to escaping nor did they put any guards outside his room or anywhere else to guard a living walking breakthrough in military so he walked out and got a cab examples like this one are not only numerous there is in fact just about no single scene that makes sense br br also the so called great effects were terrible he threw a basketball back to a kid in the park and the kid was thrown back 20 feet into a tree no acceleration or but constant speed and height like a motorized trolley i'm sure if i paused and looked for the cables that kept the posture of this kid the way only cables can they probably didn't know how to or bother to erase them completely if someone is thrown that far into a tree they would at least say ouch or rather be hospitalized with broken bones but the kid was just just confused and amazed br br moronic that's the word for every creative decision made throughout the entire production i'm going to put the director's name on my own personal blacklist someone as poorly skilled as him cannot improve i feel like demanding compensation for having wasted 45 minutes of my life for watching it and the time it took to write this although it felt therapeutic it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get a pilot approved the only excuse a slightly intelligent person could have to watch this voluntarily would be imprisonment or lobotomy
<START> buster keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films and they don't come more rib funny than this gem the dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix up with a wanted felon this leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the wanted signs the goat is a bloc with brilliant site gags from the opening scene at the bread queue right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end a keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking as sound is never something you needed with him his movies explain themselves through the wonderful yet incredibly dangerous things he did to himself it isn't hard to see just how influential he really was the man is every bit as thoroughly amazing today as he was in 1921
<START> i was expecting born to kill to be an exciting high tension film noir instead it's got two good action set pieces one at the beginning and one at the end and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by robert de usually a glamor cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir but the rest of the film is pretty boring lawrence tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by the numbers performance mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after dillinger an overrated movie but at least better than this claire character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal and the action such as it is stays so resolutely inside that damned house in san francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling it's one of those movies in which the supporting players notably elisha cook jr whose character's homoerotic itch for tierney's is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script and isabel jewell out act the leads it also doesn't help that nearly half a century after alfred hitchcock and anthony perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in psycho tierney's is so gross and obvious he might as well have psycho tattooed on his forehead also there's no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called deadlier than the male but perhaps james gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film born to kill is a real disappointment from robert wise who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career
<START> this comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its temporarily high user rating which i find frankly puzzling the reasons why i didn't like this title are following br br 1 the directer must have had some doubts whether to make a jackie chan type of a flick or a dark tragedy as a result in terms of genre the film falls between two stools as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole br br 2 the characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing psychological truth and logic are sadly missing br br 3 absurd casting i don't blame the actors for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone if there is scarce logic in the script however why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors whose ages in the film can't differ by more than 3 4 br br 4 to me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2 if you can't find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest when you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist it turns out to make no sense br br 5 some films apart from being entertaining are also thought provoking having seen this film i began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful i cannot put any other construction on the ending br br 6 the film is rife with totally unnecessary violence violence in a film and elsewhere is a good thing if it serves an important and worthy purpose purposes can be different and i don't want to enter into this broad subject let me just say i don't object to violence in such films as saving private ryan the passion of the christ or the pulp fiction in oldboy the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic or aural what for i do not know personally i don't derive any satisfaction from watching teeth being extracted with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him choking on his own blood etc etc br br 7 the film reminds me a little of japanese porno in its fixation on incest and young asian girls' panties urinating and the like it appears there is a minority who actually enjoy this kind of thing if you're one of them you might find this film enjoyable br br in short i do not recommend this film either as entertainment or food for thought where it isn't silly it is disgusting don't waste your time
<START> malcolm mcdowell diagnoses megan gallagher's daughter and she as having a form of illness when they believe they are seeing the troll like creatures which live with the rocks and the roots to quote the movie br br basically a family moves into an older house which has a smaller doll house in the backyard the daughter well played by sofia starts to befriend the creatures until they become vindictive the family cat also disappears br br there are a few good scenes with megan gallagher millennium and malcolm mcdowell as the psychiatrist there is also something strange which occurred to one of mcdowell's patients br br if you enjoy this type of story you may also like bad ronald which had a similar odd theme and the house is haunted by bad ronald scott jacoby only that movie is from the 70's 7 10
<START> there were two things i hated about wasted the directing and the script i know i m opening myself up to ridicule but stephen t kay s direction is too much like a like a well like a mtv pop video it s shot i think on digital video against an intrusive soundtrack often out of focus and often with rapid cross cutting if you re not a teenager you ll find many segments of wasted unwatchable due to the stylistic approach as bad as the directing was it was the script that yanked my chain the story is told through samantha a poor little rich girl who spends much of the film talking through voice over strange how the voice over never seems idiosyncratic enough to have come from the same character telling us of the pressure of her exams the pressure of home life her social solitude and it s all this that led her to take drugs it s for similar reasons like parental break up that her two male friends i thought she was supposed to be lonely to start taking drugs oh poor little sammi in her nice house and her problems how my heart bled for you and your chums not what wasted doesn t mention is that no matter what someone is addicted to be it drink drugs nicotine or chocolate that person has to work at becoming an addict they re not a victim of external forces they re an act of free will both traffic and trainspotting made this point very well people become addicts because they want to to portray them as victims in any way is wrong patronising and very possibly dangerous br br by the way if mtv are anti drugs will they stop playing videos from stars who freely admit taking drugs
<START> this season lacked real but as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood again season 6 is without highlights and spontaneity br br this season lacked its usual sopranos style and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season you probably would have had 6 episodes worth of real stories br br side stories like pauly's mom is she or isn't she was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character i would have like to have seen bobby express his anger more at pauly in that carnival episode but to no avail br br and that's just it these side stories had no real purpose and lack finishing if they are going to finish off these stories in the next 6 episodes i'd rather not watch it because its not really worth seeing br br disappointing is to nice a word to say about this season and its finale
