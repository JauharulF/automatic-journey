<START> this belabored and sloppy spy melodrama featuring two buffoonish one idealistic one drug addled california kids dealing secrets to the kgb never seems to get enough steam up to sustain any tension and suspense before it dies a very slow death over two hours later john schlesinger's finished product gives the impression that he was asleep in his director's chair most of the time as the film lags and the actors sleep walk save for the highly annoying over the top performance of sean penn br br childhood altar boys and friends chris tim hutton and penn devise a plan to sell secrets to the kgb when chris lands a job that allows him access to top secret government materials disillusioned by what he sees as us meddling in foreign affairs the idealistic chris and the drug hungry make contact with the russians and begin to funnel them classified materials when chris decides he wants out things begin to unravel at a lackadaisical pace br br the eighties were not kind to distinguished director john schlesinger in the 60s and 70s he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both england and america but then came honky tonk freeway in 1981 and it marked the beginning of the end the falcon and the snowman more or less put a lid on it lacking the suspense of marathon man and the quality performances hoffman voight christie jackson finch olivier he had coaxed from leads in the past falcon goes in circles most of the way br br sean penn chews scenery from start to finish in such an obnoxious fashion you find yourself encouraging his torturers to do more to him tim hutton is governed by his limited acting chops and most of his scenes show a need for more rehearsal time lori singer as hutton's girlfriend plays it mute most of the way with schlesinger content to film her vapid expressions when she does emote you understand why only david suchet as the kgb handler with a piercing eyed introspective presence and restraint acquits himself well
<START> cultural vandalism is the new hallmark production of gulliver's travels an act of cultural vandalism not literally after all not a single copy of the book is burned but if this is the only gulliver people are exposed to many it will people will not get anything like what jonathan swift intended were jonathan swift alive hallmark could be sued for moral rights violations and they'd lose that's a good way to think before starting a project using someone else's ideas br br swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity through his hero gulliver he travels to places that make him feel big small shat on andÂ human the little people in are small in every way petty and stupid they fight the big enders and little enders interminable wars of annihilation over which end of their soft boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table sounds a bit like us br br i forget most of the rest it's been years since i read it the tv show reminded me of a few things and on the bright side it made me want to read it again br br this gift to mankind has been shat on like under the beneath the vulgar yahoos and danson and especially two great actors peter o'toole and edward fox ought to be thoroughly ashamed some creative person got the bright idea to put the focus on the star gulliver played by ted danson whose acting is just plain bad he portrays gulliver as insane all his travels were made up of course swift made up gulliver naturally the lands he visited were imaginary that's called fiction his purpose was to talk about humankind and our often awful relations with each other the travels of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method but these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that hallmark couldn't turn into one of its anodyne cards is suspect br br i can sure see why hallmark would produce this crap it's so bad that o'toole always profound seems as little as his character he's in character of course while commenting on the character simultaneously as many if not all great actors do informing the character sheds light on it our light completes the character it becomes three dimensional through this act of psychic most actors do this very subtly like hopkins in the remains of the day others like nicholson in most things in the last twenty years play the two parts pretty broadly apart nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us too with him it's all cat's cradle and he chuckling away holds all the strings great fun as is o'toole but something here is lacking he is shouting into a megaphone as great as ever and all one senses is a hollow shell standing under him br br that's because it is look up anodyne and there ought to be the word hallmark as a synonym harmless bland inoffensive hallmark is the doll who can't pee because she has no genitals it is the norm the average the person of no distinction hallmark is to have no hallmark i never suspected that such people despise those who have imagination quite so much suddenly disney against the meta stands out in bold type or einstein's men of genius always will be violently opposed by mediocre minds indeed anyone to this mediocre type who has an answer to any question other than a or b is suspect who more distinctive then that a man who journeys to the darker places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what can be found there hence the act of vandalism the taliban destroyed the buddhas in afghanistan the palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world at jericho the barbarians the great statuary of the classical age and these things are obviously vandalism hallmark endeavors to protect us from foreign foes by undermining our own culture the one that feeds and sustains them and us br br please buy a copy of gulliver's travels wherever you live and read it or order it online i like to use abe books
<START> a truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict the movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being or being around a heroin addict really is good movie which will never truly be outdated excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is preminger's way of showing how bleak a world can become worth a look an education of sorts the golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in
<START> this is probably the most uninvolving film i've ever seen i watched it because i have a soft spot for leon everything else has done has been just awful in my opinion with the exception of the script for wasabi and jean reno it's a testament to just how bad this film is that reno one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable actors admittedly he's just starting out here can't make this film or the moments in which he is on screen watchable br br it's all very film black and white no dialogue people doing things for no apparent reason people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera and predictably none of it is entertaining br br it's not a french mad max as some people have claimed actually i think they mean mad max 2 that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post apocalyptic setting and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about mad max 2 was pulsating mad max 2 was exciting mad max 2 was worth your time le dernier combat is none of these br br i know it's supposed to be cool to like arty black and white french films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy which is why i wouldn't trust anyone who claims to like le dernier combat because i see nothing of worth in it whatsoever it asks for so much and gives nothing back i found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention anyone who can sit through it isn't human or at the very most is psychotic actually they're probably just trying to seem cool
<START> this movie is awful i can't even be bothered to write a review on this garbage all i will say it is one of the most boring films i've ever seen br br and the acting is very bad the boy who plays the main character really annoys me he's got the same expression on his face through out the movie i just want to slap him basically 80 of the movie is slow motion shots of weird music and utter sh t br br apparently i've got to write at least 10 lines of text to submit this comment so i'll use up a few more lines by saying the lead character has got one of those faces you just want to slap br br meh i give up this movie sucks
<START> isn't it strange how crap movies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like boy this is going to suck harder than few things have ever sucked before it's pretty much impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high Â or even remotely positive expectations as house of the dead 2 is a sequel to something that is generally considered to be one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever to be released the abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director michael hurst as it was really easy to surpass the quality level of its predecessor and exactly how embarrassing must this be for uwe boll huh having to acknowledge that a straight to video sequel without star power or promotional campaigns is much better than his own pretentious video game interpretation in case anyone still doubts no house of the dead 2 dead aim isn't a good horror movie at all but yes it's definitely better than the first and even worth renting in case you're looking for an undemanding splatter film with loads of gory butchering sleaze and stupid humor there's no real connection with the events in the first film another advantage and this part two opens like a typically rancid sex comedy set in a college campus the male fraternity club plans to attack a sorority house inhabited exclusively by blond coeds with enormous breasts but the party gets interrupted when an insane professor sid haig who runs his car over a girl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a zombie this is the beginning of a quickly spreading and deadly epidemic but no worries as the government is prepared and sends their best scientists soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and to bring back blood samples for an antidote hunting down zombies seems like the most common thing in the world for this squadron they even named them hyper sapiens but their constantly increasing amount eventually the lives of the most hardened soldiers director hurst thankfully found his inspiration in the more eminent classics of the genre like james cameron's aliens and Â of course george a romero's dead trilogy particularly day of the dead he luckily also didn't made the same mistakes as uwe boll who inserted footage of the actual video game in his movie why and slightly exaggerated with the use of cgi techniques hotd 2 contains heavy images of violence like chopped up female corpses and detailed but it never really becomes nauseating or shocking naturally there's isn't the slightest bit of suspense to enjoy and every dreadful horror clichÃ© features here as well the film is very enjoyable as long as story writer mark altman doesn't try to explain the origins of the zombie epidemics they're walking corpses with their brains hanging out of their skulls so we really don't need to know what caused their deaths especially not when the explanations are given by a blond sorority slut who clearly hasn't got a clue what all the medical terms mean just avoid getting bitten sweetheart
<START> i watched part of the first part of this movie and tiny little bits of other parts maybe i'm mistaken but i don't think this movie is really worth watching the odd characters and happenings does catch your attention and is rather interesting but there are bad things in it as well and some gross things the magic and mythical side of it turned me off and for most christians this movie would not be very suitable or worthwhile to watch
<START> one of bolls better attempts just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance it is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne the main difference between bloodrayne and farcry really is that the story from farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas bloodrayne had a strong story and thus boll had more chance to mess it up br br the action in this movie is actually fairly good occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that br br acting wise it was pretty decent most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances but the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps br br while i think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference especially given the plot of the game was hardly oscar winning just a vehicle for fps carnage would have liked it set in the jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but canada doesn't have a great deal of jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest br br why boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots i don't know but he does and until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder
<START> i'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts nor am i bothered by the cynical self righteous stance the makers of this crap take br br what i am bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake i wouldn't even be surprised if all of the episodes were staged hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than oprah garbage television with zero comma zero appeal like daily tv soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot br br the premise would have turned out great if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer if only this idea were free of all the legal complications trappings that would most certainly ensue due to what would happen with real people and what is eventually aired hence the only way to create this reality show was to get some rather desperate actors and make them improvise and what pitiful and unconvincing improvisation it is most of the time shouldn't this be obvious to anyone who finished grade school most reviews i read here don't even mention that any of this is fake let alone that all of it might be wishful thinking or just boundless naivety br br the actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of bottom of the barrel unemployed actors who are miserably waiting on tables waiting eagerly for a call from a talk show or this crap which is when they finally get a chance to make several hundred bucks i even recognized one actress in the role of cheater that i saw years earlier in the jerry springer show and i only saw 6 7 episodes of cheaters how many more of these loser actors are there that appeared in springer and cheaters that i don't even know about br br however to compare cheaters with springer isn't fair to the latter the springer show is not all fake a bulk of the episodes are hence often highly entertaining there is no value to be found in cheaters unless you're a struggling actor and want to get tips on how not to act in front of the camera br br the producers use various very cheap transparent tricks to create the illusion of realness to give their footage that elusive documentary feel but it's all in vein in the end the more intelligent train wreck seeking viewer is left with absolutely squat professional wrestling has more credibility than this
<START> i too remember seeing this film as a youngster at a local small theater that presented foreign films each week it was the daring adventure of it all that stayed in my memory ever since br br especially impressionable was the scene with noel purcell as the old seaman paddy who drank too much saw or heard apparitions and died of fright in a cave i always kept track of career even decades later due to my seeing him then there's also a youngish cyril cusack as the leering james with designs on the lovely jean simmons shown as grown up br br would very much like to own a video of this haunting film and refresh my memory of it where do i send my request
<START> writer director dean bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film his dialogue was snappy and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film's narrative structure br br at the heart of the film is the character of alice who is running away from her new england past in a desperate effort to get to florida along the way she travels with a pair of eccentrics bill and sandra who incredibly make the attempt to groom alice as a prostitute earning money at truck stops br br as a newcomer performing in her first screen role emily grace as alice is sensational there is not a false note in her character choices but the film is worth watching above all for the wily yet sensitive character of sandra as masterfully created by judith there is an especially sly subtext to virtually every moment in which is on camera as a viewer i found myself stopping the tape hitting rewind and reviewing her scenes in order to attempt to discern the psychological subtleties br br the film raises the following question about the characters are bill and sandra good or are they an evil pair of dickensian predators preying upon the youthful alice one of the strengths of the film is that it never quite fully answers that question alice seems more self confident than she started out as a result of her experiences with bill and sandra but is she really a better person br br part comedy part road picture and part coming of age drama this carefully crafted film succeeds in involving us on many levels
<START> i watched this on sky tv late one night as i am a vampire fan i must admit i half expected it to be a b movie disaster but i was pleasantly wrong br br subspecies is about a family of vampires when a vampire lord dies his two sons the handsome and noble stefan and his brother the evil hideous start a war with each other over their birth right the the is a holy grail of sorts for vampires and it bleeds the blood of saints which give the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high br br the fight for the takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students turn up in the brothers' territory on a school trip and stefan has to protect them from his brothers lusts br br like i said i went into this film not expecting much at all but it was one of the best low budget movies i have ever seen the sets and locations romania i think been a while since i've seen it are very nice and the music score did the film justice br br most of the acting was adequate but its anders as the evil that steals the movie and all the subsequent sequels performance as the twisted vamp is truly breathtaking and bumps the film simply from okay to pretty d mn good
<START> this is one of nine shorts on the anime disk the animatrix it is my favorite the artwork is amazing the black and white somewhat grainy texture perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to portray the story is tight and the ending is true to film noir br br overall i gave the animatrix a 7 but this particular segment deserves a 10
<START> the trailer is so deceiving i thought this will be a good film what was the point in bringing the women in hong kong for being killed they could have done it in paris and the fist half hour br br you love me br br no i don't you love me br br no i don't you love me br br no i don't repeat for 100 times then well i don't love you so i shoot you d so here is the reason why movie piracy is a good thing imagine if i would have even give money for this torture i'm sorry for the time i lost watching it the film makers should pay me br br for the inconvenience worst film ever seen
<START> tv news producer jane craig hunter meets tom hurt an up and coming news presenter at a seminar and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room romance however is cut short when it emerges that tom is in his own words no good at what i'm being a success at and jane realises he personifies everything she hates about where tv news is going the rub comes when tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in washington br br jane and tom's initial attraction is therefore given a second chance but will jane be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she finds herself attracted to and should she aaron altman brooks is jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidante despite his obvious talent aaron's career is stalling as he lacks the confidence and people skills and the classic good looks to be the success that his new less qualified and less intelligent colleague tom is becoming he is also concerned that his good friend jane maybe falling in love with tom despite her better judgement as it becomes increasingly clear that aaron has his own romantic feelings for her br br this central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a tv news network office where moral dilemmas and ethics are wrestled with quickly and where appearances and dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and important br br this is where most of the bite comes from with well observed comment and scenes one of many moments is a scene where tom meets the network's top anchorman bill a cameo role for jack nicholson for the first time and the camera focuses on their handshake in a film full of great lines and dialogue long and short you realise a lot about these two men's character from this one quick shot of two hands br br the dialogue between characters is amongst the most intelligent and witty you are ever likely to find anywhere on film and in such abundance brooks gets the best portion of them in line with his character but even the briefest conversations that are incidental and perhaps over heard by one or more of the characters as they move through a crowded room should be listened to br br hunter is a tour de force in this role for which she was rightly and not alone nominated for an oscar and for which she probably would have got if it was for a role in a film that didn't mock part of what had become a closely related industry and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feel good rom com br br brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally too smug for his own good aaron altman br br hurt whilst possessing the looks and providing the personality required of his character does not always convince that he is quite as dim witted the character says he is or is supposed to be he displays a latent intelligence that enables him to make the most of his apparent limitations which may be plausible but i don't think hurt quite pulls it off apart from when he tells us he stinks or doesn't get it hurt comes across as a bit smarter than that otherwise it is an effective performance in a role where his character is compromised by its intellectual limitations but brooks and hunter slightly overshadow hurt's performance it is the only negative thing i can say about the whole film and who is to say that anyone else would have done it better or come off any better when next to hunter and brooks and their performances in this movie br br support is ably provided by amongst others robert lois chiles and joan cusack and there is also a bit part role for christian of subsequent boston legal fame and the briefest of bit parts for joan's brother john cusack whose face you don't even see br br james l brooks has provided us with many great tv shows and movies and this film should rank up there with the very best of them it may not have won any oscars despite seven nominations but it did win plenty of other awards and turned holly hunter into a star
