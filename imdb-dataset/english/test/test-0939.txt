<START> almost 20 years before frank marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic alive there already was the legendary mexican exploitation director renÃ© cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film de los the unforgettable fatal flight of fairchild 571 that crashed in the argentinian on october 13 1972 this terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers most of them members of a professional rugby team but 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow passengers of course you can't claim that this cheaply made and roughly edited film is better than the famous 90's version but i definitely appreciate and respect this film more after all an exploitation film demands a lot more input from both cast and crew while the big budgeted marshall film although intense feels more like routine money making the sets and special effects naturally can't compete with alive but delivers an equally impressive sentiment of hopelessness and creates an even more nightmarish hell of snow film is ambitious surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable mexican productions ever i am really astonished that take on this story isn't more exploitative and explicit the scenes where the deceased passengers are cut open and consumed are nevertheless hard to digest but they only serve to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to stress the inhuman conditions of the survivors rather praiseworthy for a vicious director who gained fame with his notoriously bad films like night of the bloody apes and the santo series the unknown young mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is endearing the story is well known of course so the screenplay doesn't offer any unexpected shocks either by history or previously having seen alive you know which kind of dramas these people still have to endure before being rescued and you can only await them still this is a good film that shouldn't be bashed like too often is the case
<START> its a sin how these things are made but then again we wouldn't get to see the best dummy scene ever filmed ahhh the beauty of low budget bigfoot flicks you lean to see the beauty the more you watch them thats if your brain doesn't melt first as i said before this has the best dummy scene ever words cant express it you have to see it for yourself wonderful lines such as smells like flesh human you will know this one when you see it the creature makes a blah blah sound and the scene where the baby gets shot will make you cry with laughter you will be rewinding it has a car chase chase a bigfoot folk song as well as a disco song it dosn't end there while watching the credits a friend noticed wardrobe provided by k mart you ask how could you even get as far as the credits and then watch them i could only explain this as a sort of shock to the brain you are so mentally exhausted you cant move and also i guess you have to know who was behind the mess all that being said this is a must see especially if you want to punish yourself mentally its a keeper
<START> rose Â does anything actually happen in this episode it introduces our two leads a slow witted grinning idiot of a doctor and an utterly un interesting companion there's no plot to speak of childish humour mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music what else is there to say really br br the end of the world Â a marginal improvement in that we see our first outer space scenario subsequently brought down by poor contemporary humour paper thin logic very poor pacing and tired sf clichÃ©s br br the unquiet dead Â best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode write interesting character dialogue and integrate an intriguing plot let down solely by the doctor and rose br br aliens of london world war three doctor who degenerates into farce what more can be said penelope wilton brings the proceedings a little gravity trying her best in dire circumstances some poorly written and out of place soap opera elements come to the fore in these two episodes and a return to poor pacing bad plotting and cringe worthy humour satire br br dalek Â not great however still far above the rtd fare to date the pacing and script are all fine though the doctor and rose still irritate the effects and menace of the dalek are introduced well the finale however took an interesting premise that reduced the doctor's most notorious foe into a cuddly touchy feely mess and turning a previously un seen menace to a blue rubber squid that looked like a child's toy br br the long game the first rtd script to show any plot even if it was in a clichÃ©d 80s style still it was marred somewhat by his usual over reliance on juvenile jokes placing it too far in the future to make logical sense and again poor pacing not as bad as his previous efforts but instantly forgettable br br father's day Â the initial premise could've been vaguely interesting but common sense and logic abandon this episode from the very beginning also we are treated to a whole episode of soap opera before you start thinking this is all about characterization remember there's a big difference between lame soap opera and characterization on the plus side it does prove rtd isn't the worst script writer so far br br the empty child the doctor dances this started off in a mediocre way with some cringe worthy moments and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil wouldn't make well lit windows in a blackout anyone after this the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn florence truly steals these episodes showing us what an interesting companion could've been like she could also act instead we get the annoying and politically correct captain jack as the new companion the conclusion was a little hasty but sufficient the pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing br br boom town i have to be honest except for a few examples i had been so disillusioned by the current series that upon seeing the trailer for another episode i gave up and didn't subject myself to the torture br br bad wolf reality tv arguably the worst facet of the modern media is basically used as the premise there's no subtlety whatsoever do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of the running man or truman show no of course not this in an rtd episode so they're basically here to cynically try and pull in the audience of said shows once again logic goes out the window as we're placed 200 000 something years in the future rtd tries pointlessly to shoe horn in some 'over story here with no relevance other than it's own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end they make empty threats and the doctor grins once more like an idiot for the climax faster paced for the most part than other efforts this has one or two interesting moments otherwise another lacklustre instalment br br the parting of the ways the big finale more of a damp squid literally all of the dalek menace set up in is brought crashing down as they become rather pathetic so many plot holes riddle this episode with typically poor contrivances daleks want to harvest humans as daleks but then vaporize entire continents dalek's can vaporize said continents but not destroy the tardis in space the tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere even over people so they can be saved in it this ability can't be used to easily destroy the dalek 'god' the daleks can vaporize entire continents but don't just nuke satellite 5 to destroy the doctor and instead let him play around the doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions after eradicating his whole species to try and eliminate the daleks these and many other holes aside we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever conceived joined with a near pointless story arc br br so what can we say about the new series all in all br br would this have gained a second series if it were anything other than doctor who with rtd behind it would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than un original and forgettable if they were anything other than doctor who and had name attached i think not br br some people would have us think we can't say anything against rtd since we owe him for bringing doctor who back to our screens however this at the expense of good characters and stories personally i'd rather not have a poorly planned ill conceived product churned out at that price i'd rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort for the most part this is the kind of puerile rubbish that gives sf a bad name marring what is otherwise the most creative genre
<START> i i don't know where to begin dragon hunt might just be the worst film in cinematic history even anus was better than this as it was intentionally bad showgirls no it had kitsch value and was technically a well made film but dragon hunt takes the cake and eats it then vomits it back up and feeds it to a homeless man it's that much of a travesty br br the acting if it can even be called that is rough it doesn't have the charm of improvised acting so it must be scripted but it's recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors or basically those people on screen either regretted being connected to this film or were thinking of a particularly humorous joke from saturday night live which they had watched prior to getting in front of the camera i could write another three paragraphs on the quality of acting in this film but you and i both don't want to hear it br br the make up and special effects which with most films is the only good thing was laughably bad the antagonist whose name is so ridiculous i can't remember it has a mohawk glued to the top of his head yeah glued to his head and you can tell it's glued on too if you look at the spot where it meets his skull you can see a plastic strip not unlike the ones on fake eyelashes thankfully he's pretty much the only example of make up no nos in the film br br there's also some terrible character development to put it lightly the women who are strangely rough handled by the supposedly benevolent fugly brothers and i mean they are really pushed around are not only ugly but gasp they don't know what they're doing in one scene they turn on their apparent lovers join up with the even uglier bad guy and then snort some coke apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine because they started shaking and laughing even before all of it went up their nostrils great timing girls plus they wear some truly horrible stuff clothes that belong solely in the late 80s and early 90s br br overall this movie this film this waste of film i should say is also a waste of time watching it will hurt you and will require the suspension of not only your belief but also of your entire brain if you want to get stoned with your friends and have some good laughs see if you can get this film you'll probably have to download it otherwise don't even think about it hope i was helpful
<START> i am a pretty much a sucker for those ghost hunter shows from the cheesy mockumentaries like discovery channel's the haunting to scooby doo reality shows like ghost hunters when i saw promos for a e's paranormal state i knew i was going to watch especially when paranormal state was juxtaposed against a weak monday night football game br br by the end of the pilot of paranormal state when the main character in this reality dance macabre gives a creepy kid a bottle of max von sydow holy water and reassures him by telling this boy that he too had a unspecified bad experience as a child with things that came out of the closet and the catholic church gave him a holy water to fend off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot br br the shtick behind paranormal state is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club or society or super adventure club and they run around pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an m night movie br br the they is kind of a misnomer really paranormal state revolves around a lion named ryan who would probably be running penn state's yearly anime convention if it wasn't for this show he is often accompanied on investigations by hot co eds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera hey are they ghosts too br br this is ryan show paranormal state is his vehicle as we like to say in the biz and oh what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be br br did i mention ryan narrates the entire episode of paranormal state in a star date less director's log voice over almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryan's ghost hunting some gravitas but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs seriously every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game br br the investigations the plot that each episode revolves around are interesting on the surface no haunted or restaurants to be found in paranormal state this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear br br small children are harassed things loom in the dark voices encourage the living to kill and the aleister in me rubs my hands of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent nasty hauntings tied to violent nasty deaths br br maybe br br maybe not br br everything in paranormal state is short handed into half hour dog the bounty er ghost hunter blocks every time there is an interesting shred of evidence the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the 1800s the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander br br at least with sci fi channel's ghost hunters there is a somewhat over exhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer that could be a rat farting cold spots in a house and orbs that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters almost believable br br whereas paranormal state claims to have but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio yep see an evp right people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement well we will just go and see about that while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room ryan the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates is claiming to see visions of a demon's name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting but he can't tell us the audience or his team of out because he can't you never say a demon's name out loud ryan informs the wide eyed co ed who dare inquires br br well how very very convenient for you especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind br br paranormal state is all turn and no prestige the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people not even grainy video of a chair moving or a black blob running between prison cells nothing you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over br br if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little if you are trying to sway me show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode br br paranormal state is weak sauce not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time or just have that thin of a dvd collection or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy water

<START> man am i stoked i can leave feedback for this 10 minutes romp i love it br br after not seeing it in years i happened upon it the other day and watched it over and over br br 'stop shaking your eyes' and a rock and roll band' and 'stop sawing the table' are freaking classic lines br br the art is delightfully raw the dialog sparse and wonderful just find it and love it cannot recommend this enough br br thank you high school art teacher mrs for showing us this over and over thank you for letting it be made thank you for showing it for free at the moment at least br br i want a big snit t shirt now i'd love an animation cell but at 00 a pop that won't happen br br find this flick and watch it
<START> the last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was in dreams in that movie you didn't see insanity you were there now the cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer the opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy and the things that catherine deane jennifer lopez sees are first fascinating and then terrifying the things that she later sees in the mind of vincent vincent d'onofrio are amazingly imaginative and fascinating most of this stuff has never been seen in film before br br the story of the cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking in fact it is basically the same as the story in the silence of the lambs you have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life the only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in the silence of the lambs you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim while in the cell you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim however despite the unfortunately weak story the cell completely the genre of the psychological thriller none that have ever been made even come close to it br br also the film had good direction and was extremely well acted vince vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances he was even good as norman bates in the pathetic 1998 re make of psycho and even jennifer lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career the other being the great out of sight nothing can be said of the cinematography in the cell to give it sufficient credit it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history the cell is an incredibly well made film and it deserves to be recognized
<START> dead man walking is a piece of incredible filmmaking all the acting is top notch and realistic and the script examines the issue of the death penalty from both sides paying equal homage to both above all this is a deeply moving story of redemption of death with dignity and loss of ego any film that deals this courageously and maturely with such incredibly difficult subject matter deserves a rating of 10 10 thank you tim robbins
<START> i saw this film before two weeks it's kitsch boring and totally unintelligible for people that haven't read the original book there are many fact mistakes too actors plays rather poor you must laugh even in the sad moments it was a totally waste of time
<START> the portrayal of the marines in this film is spot on the action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content the uniforms and weaponry of both the u s and german troops were perfect the costumes and weaponry of the were perfectly accurate as well this film could easily be used to teach of the period and has been used by the usmc academy for this purpose the scenes depicting roosevelt shooting and the rifles he was using was beautiful procuring so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for is a genius
<START> oh my bad clothing worse synth music and the worst david hasselhoff the 80's are back with vengeance in witchery an american italian co production helmed by infamous joe 'd'amato on the production side and short careered director thank heavens for small miracles fabrizio laurenti directing marketed as a kind of sequel to sam raimi's evil dead series in italy that was dubbed la casa in there witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting br br a mix of ghost story possessions and witchcraft the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix ups slow it's progress to expectable ending topped with some serious wtf surprise climax i just love the look on her face surprisingly laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few very few scenes unluckily for him these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively br br the plus sides are experienced when the gore hits the fan this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's italo gore when things were made 100 hand made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow i could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over the top ways that obnoxious characters and actors got mangled and misused one by one i only felt sorry for linda blair who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl woman role ever in his career or so it looks like when checking out his filmography br br well folks not much more to tell and even less to tell home about don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror and speaking of hearts every movie that has david hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors must have it's one on the right place br br this is my truth what is yours
<START> errol flynn's roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous and some would say infamous general custer that follows his career from his first day at west point through the civil war and out west to the battle at the little big horn all the while butting heads with rival arthur kennedy and romancing pretty olivia de havilland br br some might say that flynn who delivers a great flamboyant performance as the general is basically playing himself playing custer br br a lavish production that should have been in technicolor well directed by raoul walsh they died with their boots on features some truly well staged battle sequences also it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse br br the previous year flynn played jeb stuart opposite ronald reagan's george custer in santa fe trail also with de havilland another action packed warner brothers production designed to make you fail history class
<START> for a film made in senegal based i guess loosely on carmen the book by prosper this film doesn't achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films br br ms as the of the title is very good to look at her fiery dancing smolders the screen as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film br br this is a that aims to please to all genders but a real carmen she is not br br we would like to see ms in other films in which her talent is better used than here
<START> spoilers br br as you may know i have been commenting on a lot of silent short films in the past months now i have no idea why i am commenting on steamboat willie i guess i was just desperate to comment on anything so i watched this and now i am commenting on it this or course is one of the very first cartoons and i believe it is not the first cartoon with sound br br here is the plot mickey mouse is driving a steamboat when pete throws him off and he drives it when they stop for cargo minnie mouse tried to get on but failed miserably mickey gets her up by a crane then a goat eats her sheet of paper with turkey in the straw on it they use the goat to make the song when i say that i mean that they used the goat as a victrola mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for instruments to the song then an angry pete throws mickey in a potato room and mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day br br overall this is yet another groundbreaking silent short film i mean this is the third mickey mouse cartoon yes the third also this is not the first cartoon with sound i believe there were two more before this one either way this film is really really groundbreaking was also more violent than he is mow i mean he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it br br 9 10 br br recommended films plane crazy
