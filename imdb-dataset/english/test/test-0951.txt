<START> after high school track field laura dies of natural causes during a race an event that is shown multiple times in slow motion none the less an unknown killer is murdering all the people who were on that same aforementioned team close to graduation day hence the name in this laughably inept slasher flick it brings absolutely nothing new or even good to the slasher table instead opting to merely unleash the most god awful song i've heard in quite some time with ' gangster rock' being played in a roller disco party that went on far too long br br eye candy denise cheshire linnea quigley get topless br br my grade d
<START> i got seriously ripped off with this purchase the other posters pretty well cover the failings of this poor poor film my dvd that i purchased actually had the 1978 piranha poster art on the cover with the credits for that film on the front by joe etc i was really disappointed to find the wrong film on the disc i am actually a fan of lots of bad movies there is always something funny or at least amusing on most of them somewhere not this film i am actually going to spend the three dollars in gas money to return this two dollar dvd just for the principle of the thing blatant false packaging here easily the worst movie of all time no redeeming factors at all boring not even worth checking out just to see how bad it is seriously
<START> i just saw this movie for the first time last night wow what a movie this is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see because its just so cool and so interesting br br i do not want to give a single word about the plot because i think it would be better for people to go in cold do not read the plot summary before you see the movie all i'm going to say is that eastwood malkovich peterson and the screenplay by jeff maguire are top notch i wish all thrillers were more like this one
<START> i really wish hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re make this movie is awful from the demille version all the way through this movie i was saying to myself huh what i don't remember that part the only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the red sea and in heston's version it was a heck of a lot better than this version did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud fade in and out when the red sea was being parted i think i did anyway i might might watch the last part tonight br br i wish hollywood would tackle different ideas and subject matters when they are making new movies instead of re hashing old films br br they should of left well enough alone br br update br br well i watched the last part did moses make up the second copy of the ten commandments with his own hand or was i seeing things please someone email me and let me know horrible
<START> this epic brings together a superbly gifted cast and crew a narrative depth superior to most novels wonderful music philosophy and a connection to life that i find difficult to explain to immerse oneself in die is for me akin to a spiritual experience similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky the language and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact the film inspired me to go to munich and visit some of the locations including the edgar office from then on i vowed to improve my german skills after die i feel almost german as if i am in the head of the characters i also try to match the piano playing of henry arnold hermann but this is the one thing that will always elude me this drama is unparalleled and i have been fortunate to see it on bbc2 in the uk and sbs in australia the sequel 3 is currently being filmed in germany
<START> this is one of my favourite books and i remember watching this series and loving it immensely sadly i have never seen it repeated or been able to get on dvd but it made such an impact i have never forgotten it br br the lead characters were perfect for the roles especially the lovely bryan brown and although the scenes in australia were not entirely in keeping with the book at least they were there unlike the film version with virginia mckenna which missed that part out altogether br br i agree that gordon jackson's character of is entirely different from the book but he is still excellent for your information is the gaelic pronunciation of
<START> for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series starring kenneth brannagh people interviewed by the police are hardy and often as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has huge family problems investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end both have excellent cinematography br br the plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequel br br really the script couldn't be more obviously from the cookie cutter you get even the most familiar of motifs such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview br br i'm absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television what i felt a keen lack of was message the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept and many genetic diseases unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from and is remarkably genetically homogeneous it's like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland due to privacy concerns this project was terminated and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in iceland the episode is a rich topic for debate br br but in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for sake they're there for weird atmosphere br br it's a grisly movie if you are interested in that and there's often a morbid focus on food to accompany events like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheep's head unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end this is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare if you're not well qualified deft of hand and sharp of eye you poison the client this rather novice director should have lowered the on his performance br br i walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general
<START> i caught this movie on tv yesterday i had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by emilio estevez and starring him and his real life dad martin sheen i love to see a movie about a father son relationship that involves a real life father and son naturally there's an instant chemistry between sheen and estevez and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that they're actually related of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors i've seen martin sheen in intense roles before but i think this is most intense role being that i mostly recall him from the mighty ducks series and i was very impressed talent really does run in that family and kathy bates steals the movie in an oscar worthy performance she tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue kimberly williams the beautiful actress from the father of the bride movies is also very good holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors br br the movie is a bit stagey with dialogue that's obviously geared for the stage but that didn't bother me this is not meant to be an action movie this is a character study and for a film that's based on a play it never gets too claustrophobic when character jeremy reminisces to his days in vietnam we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life br br the film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental at the end i expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunky dory but that's not how it turned out the ending made me cry without resorting to standard hollywood melodrama that proves reality is much more gripping than anything hollywood can conjure up br br if you're in the mood for a beautiful powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks off please check out this underrated gem hopefully one day martin and emilio will unite with charlie and they will all make a great film together br br my score 9 out of 10
<START> how can a name not even a real name break your heart here's how there have been few film versions of a celebrated novel that have done better justice to their source material than anthony movie of charles cold mountain if you've read the book you will be able to feel most of the major scenes soul shakingly recreated i personally cried numerous times while reading the novel and spent much of the evening watching the film through tears br br astounding scope beautiful words great acting and great music in the interview on the dvd accompanying the film talks about the multiple layers of the story all of them work one of the best films i've seen and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years
<START> the somewhat belligerent brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way by acting out but that dad is morose and blaming himself writer director dan harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams characters with question marks hanging over them and then lays all the story points out in the most obvious terms suicide secrets gay shame family sickness ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a tidy bow harris wants to make sure we don't miss a trick initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary sentimental fashion sigourney weaver's bemused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and she's a joy that is until harris gives her a make over complete with sensible new hairstyle it's the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head from
<START> shade tries hard to be another sting substituting poker for horse racing as the means by which to bring down an enemy but it fails miserably br br i watched the whole thing and still never could quite understand why the young kid wanted to double cross his partner was it because his partner stole his girl is there a woman in the world who is worth going to that much trouble over if there is it certainly wasn't this shrew she had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and really now did she actually have a special room set up so that a surgeon could remove the kidney from whoever tried to pick her up in a bar dina merrill makes a short appearance as a rich woman who hosts of all things pay the rent poker parties at her palatial home and then the players say things like i'll see your thousand and raise you another five thousand give me a break you can't call see and raise you do one or the other any kid playing for nickels and dimes at the kitchen table knows this you'd think grown men playing for stakes this high or at least the knuckleheads who wrote the script would know it too br br one of the other posters mentioned how no high limit poker game would allow players to actually deal their own cards and i agree you don't allow two of the best known car cheats into a game where the buy in is 250 000 and then let them deal to each other that's not poker that's just seeing which one can cheat better and i'd like to know what person in his right mind would buy in to a game in which two of the best known card cheats are playing and expect that he might have a chance at winning and most of all what mafia boss would run such a game every time melanie griffith came on the screen i was so mesmerized by those gigantic fluorescent red lips of hers that i completely lost the storyline and seeing her and stallone together was more like a public service announcement for plastic surgery gone wrong than a love connection stallone mentions that she used to be a grifter before she bought the restaurant she now runs but we don't know what kind of grifter she was and we never see her working with stallone in their younger days so we are left to wonder if we even care that much br br jamie foxx is the best character in the whole movie but he gets killed off right off the bat and we're left with cardboard cut outs who all sound like they're reading their lines off a teleprompter just off camera br br the ending makes no sense either the kid gets his cut from the game and just walks down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen the mafia isn't watching every move he makes everyone else just shrugs their shoulders and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recoup any of it i don't think so br br most of all this movie does a great injustice to professional poker players all over the world insinuating that the only way to win is by cards and playing with decks and why is it they're always kings and aces sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full house br br the best parts of the whole film are the of hand tricks during the beginning and ending credits everything in between is ridiculous
<START> imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you where is the absolute last place you want to hide i'd say inside the uncanny virgin of nuremberg torture device because there's a good risk you'll get brutally spiked to death and yet the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin the vampire's coffin is a rather disappointing sequel as director fernando doesn't re create the gothic atmosphere of the 1957 original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs no more ominous castles with eerie cobwebs and dark vaults but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughs instead of frights the story opens inside count de final resting place where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart and the vampire count comes to live again immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work the vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic and it's up to dr enrique to rescue her soul and to destroy the bloodsucker the vampire's coffin uses a limited amount of locations and there's very little action the whole film would actually be pretty boring if it weren't for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances the photography is amazing though with the sublime use of shadows and darkness this is most notably during the scene in which count de stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night it's the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film the rest is fairly mediocre and dÃ©jÃ  vu
<START> the last american virgin 1982 was one of the few teenage comedies that i really enjoyed the subject matter and the acting was well above the usual tripe that hollywood was and still is cranking out these days but for awhile the smaller studios were producing movies about teenagers that wasn't toned downed or soften for the kiddies the men pulling the strings behind this production were from your friends from cannon br br three teenage buddies are trying to lose their virginity whilst still in high school they'll do anyone or anything to achieve their dream goal the sensitive one of the group andrew monsoon what's to find the right girl while his two best friends will take whatever they can get one day the kid finds his perfect girl diane franklin but fate would play one of their foul tricks his best friend moves on in and sweeps her off of her feet after knocking her up the sensitive kid helps the girl get back on her feet and pays for her abortion he still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart meanwhile his best friend has a very violent falling out over getting her dream girl preggers still he tries his best to get her to love him the night comes when he pops the question to her but his heart is shattered when he sees her dancing with his former best friend in tears the kid leaves the party br br what i enjoyed about this movie was that it pulled no punches instead of being filled with phony situations it was very realistic honest and brutal the movie's filled with it's share of funny moments and hysteria i have to recommend this film for fans of teenage comedies br br highly recommended
<START> beware my lovely came on tv on bbc2 recently during the early hours so i set the video to record it and was pleased i did br br a man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow's house but she does not know what she is taking on here it turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer he starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar he then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside a young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isn't quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off eventually the man leaves acting as if nothing has happened br br i can see why beware my lovely was given an x certificate when released in the cinemas some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time i also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy too br br the cast features an excellent performance from robert ryan as the psychopath ida lupino as the widow and are joined by barbara whiting and dee pollock as the boy br br this is certainly robert ryan's most chilling performance i've seen a must see br br rating 4 stars out of 5
<START> the best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again n still not be content of watching it i have watched this movie least 10 times over the past 12 years and still it makes me laugh as if i was watching it for the first time i have great liking for good comics like the orgazmo cheech n chong monty python series and many others but this one in hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies some of them recently in hindi are golmaal munnabhai series and series so all i can say is hind comedy is finally evolving but andaaz is pretty different from the movies i have said above its what i call the hindi stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in hindi cinema cheers to rajkumar santoshi for the brilliant movie
