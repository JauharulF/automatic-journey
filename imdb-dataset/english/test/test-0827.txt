<START> not often it happens that a great last movie becomes such a moving performed and filmed masterpiece the cast is excellent as well as the camerawork what starts up as a merry coming together of a group of well educated citizens of an early 20th century dublin turns into a dark philosophic narration about all our fear from death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past thank you mister huston for this last piece of great cinema
<START> if you pack all the clichÃ©s about city firefighters into 105 minutes you have ladder 49 br br it has a story but is highly clouded by all the clichÃ©s it turns it into movie that with every event becomes so predictable it's not worth watching there is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficial br br it looked like it wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but ended up being boring and pretentious the parallel between jack morrison being fatally trapped beneath an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters being trapped beneath the rubble of the twin towers was all too obvious br br it doesn't compare to movies like and certainly does not set an example for future movies about fire personnel
<START> even for sci fi this movie is movie is a little out there alright more than a little my first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind br br don't watch this movie expecting another darko darko fans are never going to like another richard kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards donnie darko is a thing of the past get over it br br richard kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the meaning' the first time you watch them to be honest i had to watch the box twice before i liked it br br the deeper meaning to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble humans are self serving we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don't open mail without a return address br br summary creepy old man tells diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money then the movie takes a dive into the unusual to spare my fingers the typing for pushing the button diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race br br i liked the willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines its different its intense it has a deeper meaning although its philosophy 101 material it leaves you guessing not a hollywood ending br br i disliked why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme what god like alien has the patience for that diaz was good but was there a need for the country accent they live in virginia br br i give it a 7 because kelly didn't put as much attention to detail as with his other movies overall good flick
<START> i have been hooked on gg since midway through 2001 2002 2nd season when i tuned in to see smallville 10 minutes early thanks to beginnings i now have all but 2 episodes on tape right up through last night ep 4 9 i am a middle aged straight male and this is the only weekly tv show i watch br br i love this series because a lauren graham is a damn fine looking woman and funny and smart to boot b the dialogue is extremely well written c it is flat out hilarious putting overrated garbage like everybody loves raymond to shame many current tv comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and much despised slime pit known as married with children where the viewer is encouraged to deride and feel superior to the characters in gg the characters have faults but we can see our own foibles in them and laugh with them not at them this is stimulating tv where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapid fire exchanges and out of left field pop culture literature current events references i get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again catching all the one liners and references to previous episodes stars hollow is its own little world one that i will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs
<START> this movie was working toward two goals to make a political point and to tell a scary adventure story it's often difficult to do make a political point and still tell a good story consider the highly political but rarely entertaining final season of ellen beyond finds a good balance between politics and storytelling br br i already knew that san had won the 1991 nobel peace prize and knew something about the oppressive political situation in burma so the political message of the movie was mostly a dramatization of what i already knew but i thought the movie did a good job of telling about san and the mostly faceless dictators who have for years tried to silence her the device of presenting an unfamiliar setting through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify with is fairly common but it's quite well done in this movie br br of course the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant unfamiliar place to shake her out of her depression over the violent deaths of her husband and son she is convincingly detached and depressed her grieving condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted wanderings into the thick of a dangerous situation she does not understand something she'd otherwise be much too intelligent to stumble into br br once the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of grief she's trapped with no easy escape that sets her on a path of adventure where she needs her intelligence to survive the writers deserve much credit for making her intelligent and resourceful enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations while still finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place the directing is strong also keeping up the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship br br this movie had additional impact on me and my wife because of other events of the same time period we were preparing for a trip to india and heard news reports of western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in india avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite a different matter from escaping an oppressive dictatorship but the movie and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unfamiliar country that common characteristic gave the movie meaning beyond the strength of its own skillful storytelling the movie illustrates the international tourist's worst nightmare
<START> it may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to devi herself and when she did finally see parts of it was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in india or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself i do not know whether it was shown at all or not but given her standing at the time as a rising politician i doubt it since then i saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her days and has gone into hiding as a result br br her own concerns aside this is an excellent film made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach none of the rose tinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film it should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the film's messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant it's a true story her misgivings are it seems not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her
<START> good drama comedy with two good performances from hunter hurt but albert brooks steals every scene he is in with a great script this movie soars and gives everyone a chance to show their acting talent and although joan cusack is not in this much but she has one if not the funniest scene in the movie the highlight of the movie for me was albert brooks speech on the devil only one draw back is the fact it goes little slow in places and i only got totally interested in brooks role not so much in hunter's or hurt's i give this a 7 out of 10
<START> this is a superb tv series it's sympathetic and for once realistic portrayal of lesbian women is delicately handled and well done on top of that the directing is wonderful and the settings sumptuous and rich a real treat if you missed the first one i advise you watch next weeks 9pm bbc 2
<START> after seeing 1 and the buckets of blood they shed i was ready for another rousing of open handed heart massage and in a cage but nooooooo this was like the barney version of the first movie with that lamer from the karate kid at least bolo yeung still kicks booty although he needs to do more movies like bloodsport and caddyshack
<START> face it folks is more challenging innovative and clever than its predecessor challenging its levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time one especially difficult level is called lightning lookout in which you may be struck by lightning at any given time innovative it opened a lot of doors too bad the died out not long after this title and clever the level names range from trademark plays on words lake to witty references that the game's targeted audience won't get for many years to come bleak's house br br what irks me about most people's criticism of this game mainly comes down to two words kiddy kong he is a worthy little buddy successor to diddy kong and certainly does not deserve to be referred to as that retarded monkey will remain a classic until the end of time
<START> first of all i'd like to say i am a teenager so this is all marketed towards me and i can safely say that very poor programing and the fact that it's accepted among both genders baffles me it contains some of the worst attempts at comedy i've ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot the supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someone's lines again with poor sarcasm poor sarcasm saying bad one liners and well you get the picture also i should mention that i do still watch spongebob which i know i'll get a negative backlash for but that's quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it less we forget something missing wit the show's about a young girl carly putting on a web show with her friends which i can say is without a doubt a nicer version of the internet that's fine but the show's just well not funny at all as previously stated if this is what children's programming has come to today parents show them something that's actually funny spongebob or modern life would work br br also compared to it's show drake josh it's terrible which was implied seriously please watch something worthwhile even for a children's show it's poor
<START> i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 years old you do the math i absolutely loved it i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it climbing the furniture jumping around making monkey sounds it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this 1984 was the last time i saw that film until about a month ago it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 3 30 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 9 00 am i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid br br upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that that andie macdowell's voice was dubbed by someone else ian was of course solid as usual and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan he was great the depth he managed to capture in so few lines his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark were just amazing br br as i stated earlier i am lambert fan but i'm used to highlander the hunted and fortress in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again br br so to make a short story way too long i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until 6 00am to see it
<START> after cleaning up dodge city with a little help from wyatt earp bat masterson goes to liberal kansas where they've got a nice little range war going plus a rather interesting scheme of br br randolph scott is bat masterson and he's after villains billy house and steve brodie who are driving off their farms the they are driving off are in a scheme financed by robert ryan seems as though he's staking the various farmers to a parcel of land to homestead for a percentage of profit from their crop ryan's about to lose his shirt as a result of all the shenanigans br br as portrayed by scott bat masterson is a stand up western hero who has a passion to go east and become a reporter which we all know he did later in life br br anne jeffreys and madge meredith are involved in a romantic subplot involving brodie and ryan which is a little silly and does detract from the action anne jeffreys does sing nice though br br of course gabby hayes as always provides the great comic relief br br a good addition to the randolph scott collection of westerns also interesting because his later western films don't have him as wearing a hat as white as the one here br br this review is dedicated to kasey hayes of the professional bull riders who is a proud resident of liberal kansas a town with a great tradition whether bat masterson there or not
<START> uh oh i just said the this classic film has a plot that stinks well it's true so get over it this film was a vanity project for joseph p kennedy in which his mistress starred and money flowed to make her an even bigger star today only a fragmentary copy exists one that was a few years back however even if the film had been in perfect shape it still would have stunk for many reasons and without further ado here are some of my reasons br br first gloria swanson aged 31 plays a girl in a convent school perhaps aged 16 or 18 come on she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the kids br br second the movie all hinges on the stupid concept of love at first sight while some people believe it this it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw away everything on a woman he didn't even know what a lot of hooey br br third the movie is histrionic and the plot is nuts after leaving the school kelly goes off to east africa and then becomes queen of the whores and later after the evil queen back in europe dies that's convenient the prince is able to get out of prison actually finds kelly and marries her and she then becomes queen of a real honest to goodness country gimme a break this is ridiculous even in the days of silent film this plot was a groaner br br so in summary this is a poor film with great production values mistresses need to look good that is parading around as a classic there are so many better silent films out there see them first and avoid this tripe
<START> call me old fashioned but i like movies with plots i thought stoner comedy was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of weed is smoked and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high grandma's boy however has decided this is a full blown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached apparently allen covert star and producer and the happy madison gang were right but that doesn't make grandma's boy any less boring and unfunny they might be completely stoned but the characters are mostly half baked br br alex covert a longtime supporting player for adam sandler first time star is a mid 30s professional video game tester whose roommate has gotten them evicted he could look for a new apartment but then we don't have a movie after trying a couple friends he ends up living with good ole grandma lilly doris roberts of everybody loves raymond she wakes him up a 6 am and has him do chores and soon he's falling asleep on the job and so the new video game sequel might not get done on deadline br br like most people alex deals with his frustration and eradicates boredom by either playing video games or getting high or both his friends co workers all do the same thing most of them are virgins that live at home in addition to loving video games they're all awkward and all with the exception of nick and joel moore only at times their characters aren't funny funny if you're blazed sure i suppose but i can't say from experience br br maybe all we loser guys like is getting high playing video games and awkwardly ogling women with specific attention on their breasts but even so it shouldn't be the driving force of an entire film neither should old women getting high on accident saw that one coming or being the but of gross out sex jokes but that's what happens when a film isn't about anything no conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside of the slight problems of being out of pot alex trying to get the hot girl linda to like him and the guys scrambling to finish their levels for the video game deadline br br characters can be the saving grace for these meandering stoner flicks but aside from a lovable doris roberts the aforementioned as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and joel moore's skill at making robot noises there's little character ingenuity covert is a run of the mill main character with no comedic dimensions his dealer friend dante is an inept actor and waste of screen time and jonah hill and kevin are written so far into the periphery it doesn't matter br br if you like movies about nothing and watching them in a state of mind and body that enhance that nothingness grandma's boy will likely be just what you're looking for those who need a little more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy will be left unaffected the most i can say for grandma's boy is that it's watchable despite its pointlessness it won't feel like a total waste of time but you'll wish you did do drugs so you could at least have made the most of the hour and a half br br steven c br br visit my site at www moviemusereviews com
