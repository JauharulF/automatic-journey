<START> great book great movie great soundtrack frank sinatra shows in this movie that when he wanted to put the effort in he could act the ending is a bit schmaltzy but for the time it's understandable the studio wanted a happy ending the graphic nature of the heroin addiction groundbreaking for the period is a plus add the terrific soundtrack and you've got one of the great american movies
<START> this is an embarrassing nth rehashing of the same plot in the nth bunch of idiots young adult in peril because they are idiots slasher movie of the early millennium this time we get the story of a crazy miner who comes back from the dead to retake his gold from the hands of the we have almost no thrills almost no bare flesh even if the girls are really hot only one of them goes showing her bare ass for a few seconds the usual bunch of sunset boulevard horror stars in cameo roles this time karen black richard lynch john philip law jeff conaway lots of fake blood only the crazy miner resurrected as a zombie is cool enough to leave you stuck well not exactly to the screen till the end don't waste your time if you are not a completist

<START> when become evangelist they still exploit in the name of poverty br br my first reaction after seeing the movie is Â god bless me that i am not eating fish or any non vegetarian products br br the documentary is about lake victoria of where numerous varieties of lovely fishes used to live and one day during 1960s somebody came and injected the mighty fish perch who became the commodity for to european and japanese markets the consequences were severe Â firstly all local small and big fish were extinct secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial business capitalist sense so it is filled with arms and ammunition that is what europe can give this world thirdly the pilots as all migrants and traveling population like truck drivers has to survive their sexual needs by flourishing cheap local african prostitutes for them fourthly the brokers dealers middle men in the chain mainly indian origin business people get richer and poverty remains the same fifth poverty drives the children to crime drugs etc br br the premise to make this documentary was excellent but has the director hubert succeeded in making a good documentary it is a big no br br i say the reasons like in india it requires a higher caste to stand up and project to the world indian poverty and untouchables similarly it requires an born european documentary maker to tell the world the story of and its crumbling and ruining economy and poverty it is the pathetic motive of unaware breeding of that rich class who have never seen poverty or known poor who survives live earn and fame like pest hanging on to projecting poverty to the world as soon as they see it there is nothing more but despise by poor people in african and india who see such images of their br br the intention and motives of the hubert seems totally lop sided the images characters locales interviews are too grave and murky dark and disturbing he uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case what we feel in the end is pity and sadness for africans we also start considering the government and people as villainous may be some westerners sitting in their air conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate about the pathetic living conditions of africans but there would be nothing more than that br br the director restrains to show himself even once on the screen Â so as not to be identified among the europeans who exploit this poor country br br this director hubert can only survive being themselves like today's cnn and media giants hubert did not have guts or common sense to talk to any europeans who eat or companies who import these fish products a totally lop sided flimsy effort but i understand the reasons of the same Â hubert just wanted to rake his fame sitting and smiling with awards in his european comfort br br no more words to spare for this pathetic effort i hesitantly give the documentary a higher rating 3 5 stars out of 10 just because the theme was correct but was pathetically exploited and blown away by amateurish ill conceived director made solely for un intelligent western audiences stars 3 5 out of 10
<START> the premise is rather original and well thought of but unfortunately siding a good story is very low budget that doesn't even allow for decent special effects jeff fahey does his best amongst a poor cast as does the always beautiful linda hoffman they should make more movies together the movie while not worth much praise warrants at least one viewing
<START> story of a strange love and a fall desire poem about beauty and his perfection fear and touch a slice of visconti and mann and an agonize venice know if it is a masterpiece a poem or the reflection of a film director's world it is absolutely a memento mori and a exploration of illusion a old mirror of limits signs and death's delicacy a trip in an old space nostalgic cruel and splendid death is a trip copy in the immediate reality and the essence is the music a soft sweet music like honey or winter's fire like every regret and every sorrow like a refuge in deep solitude gustav is gay by accident he is the researcher of last form of god's presence the beauty that beauty who gives life's sense who is sin and virtue in same time the gift of expectations and sufferings he dies because he has right to hope to believe in the reality of miracle and in his way a victim no way only may give the freedom like an insignificant sacrifice who saw the sun can hope to live in same condition
<START> an old high school teacher of mine used to brag that he'd seen every movie ever made so one day a friend of mine and i decided to make up a movie called pacific inferno later we got into an argument whether the lead role was played by carl or billy dee williams our teacher found the argument interesting so he came up to us and informed us that the lead role in pacific inferno was played by jim brown we thought he was trapped in a lie that was until we went to the library and discovered that pacific inferno was in fact a real movie this incident forced me to rent the movie it's horrible our made up movie had a better plot than this piece and billy dee would have been much better in the picture
<START> i know most of the other reviews say that this movie was great but i have to disagree br br sure it's a good book it was actually one of my favorites when i was little but it's just not meant for theaters maybe for a little half hour short but i don't see how they can turn a short kiddie book into a whole feature film br br it is a cute movie but i would only recommend it for really little kids older kids will have no interest it adults may have a little more interest if they watch it with their young ones but anyone ages 7 adult will have a snore fest br br sorry if you disagree with me but this is my opinion
<START> it's a shame that such a lame plot should be hung on such picturesque locations with some documentary style reportage shoved in for extra length a shorter film may have held the tension a little more and a more charismatic lead may not have mangled his lines so much the female lead also was not allowed to do enough resulting in a pretty but boring affair it builds towards the end but the lead actor's own redemption is too little too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film not awful just a pity unexciting but nice enough to grace tv schedules of the early hours
<START> what an incredible story and what a beautiful film hat's off to ben daniels and the great honore de balzac this captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully i watched it mesmerized almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end this film's execution was almost flawless simple and pure it plays with our hearts guiding us in understanding the strange platonic absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world both are capable of affection yet ironically it's the more evolved one who becomes dependent and possessive unable to accept the other's freedom it's one of the most fascinating and intriguing look at the many forms of love and an incredible study on how oppressive and destructive human love can be sometimes br br only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with any kind of bestiality
<START> you got to love this movie i mean what other swedish splatter movie could be so evil bizarre and totally cruel the whole movie is stuffed with some kind of weird humor like the old just blows his head off and the boss just wipes the blood off his glasses and says with a mean voice your fired
<START> robert carlyle excels again the period was captured well and the soundtrack although hearing modern techno in this period piece was a little disconcerting at first proved to be very well chosen br br well worth a watch
<START> not as bad as billy but close try as he might warren beatty just could not be believed as bugsy whenever he flipped out instead of being shocked by the violence i found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony the other actors don't fare as well either annette bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women she is better off with safe characters as many have noted joe mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable george raft only harvey keitel emerged unscathed but then again this guy can do these movies in his sleep and robert beltran with just one line steals one of the big beatty bening scenes with these films i'm never sure if the director is intent on making the mobsters seem like normal businessmen or if it just comes out that way either way i don't like it these guys were killers and no matter how much las vegas is indebted to bugsy siegel i don't think that a movie should be made glorifying the guy especially one with a big studio backing
<START> the famous closeup of their breakfast meat crawling with maggots still is recorded by fire in my neurons or the wind filling the right places of the sails the fog better than carpenter's the fog cos is the real terror bursting out from human history instead of pirates ghosts but i tell ya' something not even the magnificent scene in performed by brian di palma with the excellent music of ennio morricone in the filmed in slow motion can equal the effect of the original masterpiece of the crowd climbing down the ladders we see not merely the baby but i remember the hand of a baby stepped by boot someone with no feet escaping at the last minute someone wearing glasses then a cut edition and then the same glasses broken by a bullet that passed through mini stories in a single scene
<START> i've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film making anywhere in the world it took me 3 efforts to watch this movie the first time i fell asleep after 15 minutes from boredom possibly because i was already tired as it was late at night the second effort i managed to get through 35 minutes but yet again i found myself asleep i can go on and on like this but i think you're getting the point nothing happens ever in this movie a complete waste of time and money this movie really sucks watch it and you will know what i am talking about if you can get 40 minutes into this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is the point of it all then you are indeed a masochist the only reason i gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is because 0 was not provided as an option i just thought the world needed to be warned before either hiring or worse yet buying this trash later
