<START> a stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a laugh track that must be from i love lucy i got rid of tv because of shows like this but picked up the 1st season at big lots for 3 00 should bought the van damme movie instead br br if i was a conspiracy theorist who believed that a small group of people are working against real families and keep coming up with this drivel propaganda in order to undermine family values i would point to this show married with children family guy etc but i'm not so i won't br br btw i'm not christian love the simpsons and peep show i watched two episodes and thought that if shows like this are popular who are they popular with then i remembered all those of the people of walmart that have been circulating around the web and thought ah ha it is no wonder our culture is a joke around the world when this is prime time
<START> i saw this movie in the theater when i was 14 and it changed my life i immediately cut off my hair and began buying all of the records of the bands in the movie these were some of the seminal bands of l a punk rock caught on film at the peak of their powers bands like black flag pre rollins circle jerks fear x and the germs have few equals in the history of punk music i can't believe this film has never been put out on video or dvd great movie for fans of punk rock
<START> thunderball and never are two of the biggest box office misses and never is a surprise farce from empire strikes back hero irvin kershner klaus maria brandauer seems to steal the show when in the midst of the unfolding plot bond's mission turns more to hollywood romp sometime around when basinger comes in how about klaus kinski i still think that the casting of largo makes or as is evident in both films breaks the story worst of all is the attempt to pass off the aging and very hairy connery off as the sex symbol he indeed was in the '60s the '80s was a barren time for bond flicks mostly though for your eyes only is a great title at times when i happen to need to waste some time over the holidays by watching this film in the often string of bond re run festivals i think the best attribute of the film is its score and i'm not into soft '80s
<START> i always liked listening to buddy holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash he wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of let's say chuck berry or jerry lee lewis but he wasn't far behind who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades almost every single he put out was a hit br br so i was very pleasantly surprised how good a job gary busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice he did buddy proud as were the actors don stroud and charles martin smith who played holly's backup group the crickets br br music wise there are some of holly's better known songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as holly and the boys are shown in iowa in their last concert ever busey not only sings like holly he's a dead ringer for him in the looks department some thing was the best performance ever and you get no argument from me br br i'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that iowa concert instead of dwelling on his tragic accident the ending could have been a real downer but they didn't let it be
<START> this is a pretty lousy picture it offers nothing unique or original or even interesting br br a medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is engaged in macabre medical experiments and of course she becomes involved in solving the weird deaths at the school this movie started out promising with a few cool special effects in which a guy is partially dissected while alive and tries to get away after he wakes up but then even that fizzles and the rest of the special effects are pretty routine plastic models of the human body and that unreal looking blood that these second rate horror movies always seem to have br br and as if the routine plot and the lousy acting wasn't enough this movie had subtitles that many times didn't even match the dubbed english that you hear being spoken and then add that to the mouth movement not matching the dubbing well let's just say trying to coordinate all that in your head isn't worth it for this mediocre movie br br i was at least counting on some skin in this movie and except for a bit during the opening credits this movie didn't deliver on that either br br this is a boring routine run of the mill horror gore movie short on horror and gore skip this movie unless ernest goes to camp is the only rental left
<START> we've all see the countless previews and trailers if you enjoyed knoxville getting flipped by the bull you'll take great carnal pleasure in the opening act i must caution the masses however i considered taking my under 18 son with me but am relieved i did not this compilation of obnoxious skits contains a few that albeit as hilarious as they may seem to the adult community a few are not for the immature these guys must get paid a great ransom to tolerate some of the devious stunts sometimes played at their expense in particular bam and are slighted by the group in a few particular stunts enjoy
<START> ever want to see a movie where chuck norris takes the bad guys aside and calmly discusses with them the errors of their ways until they see the light and with tears in their eyes they shake hands right the wrongs of the world together in peace and harmony and forever end the reign of evil in the world br br well forget it br br breaker breaker instead goes right for the drop kick as our truck drivin' man chuck steers his big rig into the small backwoods town where his little brother is being held by a corrupt judge and his even more corrupt law men br br chuck karate kicks chops slices and cuts every baddie in sight until not an evil doer dares raise his head a lot of fights are in slow motion for excitement purposes but just help pad out the movie to fill 86 minutes br br and there's a lot of fights here which leave just about 15 minutes for plot development and that's about all the plot you get but what did you expect calm discussion br br one star for breaker breaker and that's a small 10 4 good buddy
<START> i found this movie to be extremely delightful i am biased i suppose i happen to adore kathy bates i found her singing an added pleasure she has a very nice voice br br ms bates plays grace beasley the film takes you from her married life in chicago to england the home of her recently murdered singing idol victor fox there she meets his three surviving uppity sisters she also discovers that victor leaves behind a male lover dirk simpson br br the story leads you on to some surprisingly comedic and heartwarming situations as grace and dirk develop a true fondness for each other after an initial rather rude rejection on his part they return to chicago where they team up with grace's pint sized hilarious daughter in law to find the serial killer who murdered victor br br everyone in the picture did a fine job particularly enjoyed julie andrews lynn redgrave and barry manilow this movie was fun it makes you cry the music is absolutely charming br br other posters here who found problems with any parts of this movie just don't have a clue br br
<START> this is a great tv movie with a good story and many comic moments thanks to the excellent cast br br the only problem this movie has is that it hasn't stood the test of time as well as it might have br br despite this it's definitely worth viewing particularly if you are an alan alda or ruth gordon fan
<START> what a dire film i cannot believe that i actually sat down and watched it a very very very very very very pathetic effort with no redeeming features whatsoever the so called racing sequences are laughably awful and the plot was so bad i've forgotten it part of the film was made at the spa course in belgium in i think 1988 during the actual grand prix there i was there and am glad i didn't appear in any of the scenes shown in the film it could have been good what a pity
<START> a story of love between two people at the end of wwii beautifully filmed very romantic and yet rather fatalistic fable of budding love and war that would not end if you want happy endings don't watch movies
<START> the movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition torture and the politics of the war on terror others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie my review may contain spoilers so if you haven't seen the movie you may not want to read beyond this point br br several questions are raised by this movie first of all was the protagonist guilty or not there is no satisfying explanation for why the nsa decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the nsa thinks is a terrorist if there is the movie does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me it is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person then we will take it to the next step br br if the protagonist was guilty then what was achieved by releasing him perhaps we was well trained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into confessing without actually being guilty however there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty either br br the various other loose ends out there are 1 so a rogue cia agent has him released and flown back home what prevents the nsa from picking him up again a little publicity in the washington post please give me a break here if a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf what does corinne whitman have to fear 2 if the nsa has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom why couldn't they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything underhanded is being discussed 3 the plot is even more stupid anyways any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line not on one that can be traced back to him and his house br br the whole movie revolves around tugging at the viewers' heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture but when you think about it with any more depth there is nothing of substance in this movie only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of what that is it at the end of the movie
<START> someone definitely has it in for the wind and i cannot believe that what i saw on the screen has much to do with it this is a better and more solid movie than most of the independents i watch all year long the cinematography displays a genuine love and mastery of the craft and the casting was just fine i would love to see more of these folks especially zeke br br as far as the story and script i'm not so sure that the negative comments preceding this post were written with the intent of informing anybody else about the movie the long drawn out nit picky bashing posts that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments ever left for any movie on this site by the reviewer are obvious slander directed at the producers of the film i don't know the inside story but it would probably make a good movie what i do know from being around this biz is productions that try to make everybody happy usually end up being awful and when the filmmaker has the guts drive and common sense to kill the babies someone always ends up with hurt feelings that's part of the biz too and one of the finest learning tools available to those truly dedicated to making it in the movie business of course the failures have nothing better to do than to sit at home and write false reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta against those that snubbed them read were honest and truthful with them and that is my best guess to explain the nasty nasty reviews in as much as there is a grain of truth behind everything there is a point to be made but these exaggerations of the are so over the top that they become obviously fictitious br br it's not a slasher blood bath if that's what you're looking for it's more the psychological suspense thriller which typically is not appreciated by the lowest common out there the best way to see this movie is to try to any pre conceived notions pop it in and let it unfold seriously characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say i don't think you can come away with the conclusion that these characters were poorly developed poorly understood perhaps br br overall i do agree that this is a nicely done compelling movie perhaps i would not have given it a 9 under normal circumstances but the severe negative comments actually attracted me to the picture i have a secret love for really bad cinema to me the ratings below 5 should be reserved for the shlocky inept poorly acted and stupidly written movies none of that applies here it is quality movie making with some real talent in there i gave it the nine to to tip the scales back in the correct direction watch the movie and tell me i am wrong
<START> the only reason i saw this movie was because it had giovanni ribisi and it was supposed to be horror don't be fooled this movie has to be the worst horror film i have seen it's about these people who go to a secret location which has a monster in it the monster is a man with a deformed face running around in blue sweat pants who has a craving for brains some people die some people don't in the end they throw the monster off of a plane and then fly away happily but oh no the monster is still alive after falling out of a plane go spend 2 hours some other way like watching paint dry on a wall trust me it's more entertaining than this crap
<START> a real let down the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for tv movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow stick to mike hammer i find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book kubrick gushes over it on the cover he should have taken over the reins on this one stacey keach is too soppy as lou ford and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies tv spin off of planet of the apes i thoroughly recommend that you go out and buy lots of jim thompson novels though actually the grifters isn't done too badly thats one of his starring jon cusak
