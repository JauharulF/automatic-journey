<START> aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot this movie wasn't too bad unfortunately that doesn't leave much movie not to suck do not waste your time on this film even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia as i did watch an infomercial instead
<START> as an earlier reviewer said travolta stole every scene he was in recognize the character it was vinnie all grown up and still a bit sleazy but still likable oh yes br br disappointing were william hurt and bob hoskins perhaps because their characters were badly written or they just didn't care i kept seeing one of the baldwins never can remember which in the hurt role so hurt's incredible talents weren't wasted br br andie mcdowell is a sweetie but not very believable partly the writing character development just wasn't a big thing in this film just watch it for travolta sit back and enjoy
<START> i think purvis starts out to do a gay gone with the wind if so sorry tag it didn't happen it also didn't happen as a gay sexploitation flick i guess i'm confused what are we trying to do here much as i'd like to i simply can't get to where i care even a little about these characters this movie is effective in capturing a taste of the decadence that lives in the south it does nothing to explain enlighten or advance my understanding of a gay relationship or the conflict the protagonist seems to be grappling with
<START> being a high school student i have to take a health class this year the topic is drugs we learn about the harm they can cause a person from what we talk about i still believe and know that drugs can really mess a person up anyway my teacher wanted us to watch this naturally we groan and start to sleep but like the rest of my class i actually did enjoy this movie it was totally real and not sugar coated at all the characters were amazing and believable even the plot was outstandingly realistic and believable what i liked about this movie mainly was how it got the point of the drugs can take on an abuser and the consequences the person has to deal with everyone reassures themselves that nothing bad will happen to them well lets get serious anything can happen in a small town even to your best friend like sam and chris this movie shows it a person can really learn a lot from watching this it was pretty effective
<START> i have seen 'the sea today and i loved it the actors of the movie are wonderful specially javier bardem of course but i thought that belÃ©n would have a better role lola clara and specially mabel rivera perform excellent interpretations and i cannot forget and joan brother and father of the protagonist br br there are two technical aspects i loved very much photography and the score by amenÃ¡bar himself i liked the song 'dark by luz with music of carlos nÃºÃ±ez br br in short i think that the spanish academy should choose 'the sea in order to compete in the oscar awards i liked other spanish productions such as almodÃ³var's 'bad education' but film is much better than them 'the sea deserves all the awards
<START> women will like this movie better than men of course women like all romantic comedies more than men on average i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit however i considered this a 5 5 for the first 50 of the movie and about a 6 5 for the next 40 and about a 9 for the last 10 so begrudgingly i will rate it a 7 i tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse at least that's my objective i have over 1200 movies so why keep the dogs br br my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me though i'm not sure why i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is br br the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school undercover to write a story about the high school experience nowadays she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around her journey toward as well as her falling in love with a teacher is the story br br what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog so much so that i truly don't think i want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning argh naturally she transformed into a rather attractive cute woman by the end and she became very popular br br the ending is about a 9 9 on the very sweet scale so you out there will like that otherwise it isn't very memorable and easily missable
<START> i loved all dogs go to heaven so much that i went to see the sequel in the theater and i can't remember being more disappointed by a movie the story stank worse than an over aged sack of manure i mean come on how could carface possibly imagine being able to get revenge on an animal so much bigger than him no matter how angry he was plus depicting satan as a cat how clichÃ© can you get so much for the story is it any wonder that don bluth burt reynolds melba moore and vic tayback wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole the animation was absolutely wretched the colors were all washed out and i can't count how many times i was able to see through objects that were supposed to be solid it had to be the worst animation i've ever seen i usually like animated movies but not this bomb
<START> this is my favorite mel brooks movie because it was the first one i ever saw i was in the fourth grade when it came out and i watched it all the time i saw the producers second and then blazing saddles this is a sentimental favorite because it was my first mel brooks movie
<START> i tried i really really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two it's not that i don't get it i'm a big fan of asian cinema the truth is the movie is infantile in construction long winded and painfully disjointed br br i suppose that if you are of alfred hitchcock's school of thought don't tell them show them then you could try to appreciate this movie but you would still be hard pressed br br first of all the tries stream of consciousness in the style of jean luc godard and fails in this edward yang seems to understand the basics of the technique but he's very unskilled at it perhaps he gets better with age i don't know as i haven't yet attempted other yang films the point is he uses a dearth of show don't tell that really only serves to interrupt the procession of the story sure he gets in some visually arresting images but they don't draw the story together and they don't help to make it any better br br additionally the major concept behind stream of consciousness and show don't tell is that with the right images the right drama repetition and tight correlation the viewer will be able to make his or her own not to say that these will be the correct but those can be as the story progresses and every director should strive for some of this type of audience interaction in this edward yang sorely disappoints the viewer is constantly on the periphery there is no reason to be drawn in no reason to consider the characters or their motives no reason to get emotionally involved and really no reason to stay alert br br finally yang gets lost in the story that he wants to tell not the story that the movie itself is telling his art moves in one direction but like a large dog he can't control he's constantly yanking the lead trying to get it back onto the course he wants not the one that it is naturally following the most egregious example of this is the ending the ending really should have occurred at the moment of the husband's revelation the ending of the book that the movie is focusing on and by extension a possible ending for the movie has already been told to us if yang had chosen to end at that point he would have had a much more powerful piece leaving the watcher in suspense does the story play out as the book says or does real world play out differently asking the viewer to think about this is the sort of viewer interaction that yang painfully needs instead he continues to tell the story he wants to tell straining the natural conclusion for the sake of what for the sheer sake of lingering on a main character we didn't' need to know more about her superficially and yang wouldn't feel the need to tell us if he hadn't made her into a veneer instead of bothering to make her a more engaging and deep character to begin with br br why else does yang prolong and torture his movie to get in some more of those visually arresting images the movie truly suffers for it it wants to end it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer unsettled but instead yang pushes on instead yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer on causing him or her to constantly ask so what the first ending the one that yang ignored that was good the second ending well my thought was so what who cares because it's not as if it is introducing something that hasn't been put forth in the storyline already but the last ending that really was a waste of time not only did the real ending leave me disengaged but i also felt it was an affront to what the story could have been yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the bubblegum melancholy noir tinged conclusion that he had insisted upon all along br br my last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself but rather its post production the subbing if you see it subbed is horrible long sentences stay up for a second or two while short ones stay up far too long also as yang quickly changes images the subtitles are removed from the screen this is one of those rare instances that subtitles should be able to stay on the screen even as the image has changed because there's not much dialog going on anyway
<START> have just seen the last episode no 32 though the site says only 30 episodes were made and i must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime cop stories supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes this has at times been a gritty well acted believable and dare i say entertaining series the fact that the powers in denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least never failed to get their man it's a definite 10 10 for me
<START> scintillating documentary about how a small group of idealistic young men have used music art and dance to unify and heal the community of one of the most violent slum neighborhoods in rio means neighborhood in portuguese offering to its young people a positive alternative to the lethal gangster world of drug traffickers br br in their feature film making debut zimbalist and have crafted a movie that is breathtaking because it works on so many different levels as social document it gives the facts we need to know to have a context for understanding the significance of the particular story told here the story itself is well developed with a strong narrative arc and for added measure it is shot through with keen suspense there's an arresting charismatic central protagonist anderson sa he's a savvy natural leader articulate courageous spiritually evolved a talented performer a visionary who walks his talk br br there's also plenty of music and dancing to entertain there are talking heads Â mainly sa and his closest associate jose junior but they are presented with imaginative cinematic brilliance the editing nicely mixes footage of differing themes punctuated only occasionally by a few fact filled still texts the pace is as lively as the music a lot gets accomplished in 78 minutes br br afro reggae the neighborhood social club that anderson junior and a few others formed in 1993 deploy music and dance as the weapons to go up against the drug lords and the duplicitous police they teach percussion skills to any kid who wants to join a class along with dance martial arts a community newspaper the only requirement for kids to belong is no smoking no drinking no drugs there is a subtle soft sell spiritual fabric running through the movement loosely based on the hindu god shiva the destroyer of old habits br br jeff zimbalist who also was the lead cinematographer and the editor is a modern culture and media student at brown university he his chops editing feature documentaries for pbs and others and he teaches film at the new york film academy and elsewhere matt like andrew capturing the friedmans did a few years ago recently came to film from the business world br br zimbalist and together won the award for best new filmmakers at the 2005 film festival and rising was tied for the best film of the year in awards made for 2005 by the international documentary association i could go on for pages about afro reggae sa and this movie a way better idea is simply for you to go see it my grade a 10 10
<START> a very credible and unsettling movie portraying the effects of war on the general public shame gives us a chilling understanding oh ingmar bergman's beliefs the absence of color and sound as in a soundtrack helps to give the film a more realistic feeling there is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality at times the storyline was confusing but perhaps in order to give a sense of the characters' frame of mind Â how they too do now know what is happening or why the simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring but i could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and points he depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war in the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long drawn out shots when all of a sudden the war struck upon them they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots bergman did a good job on allowing us to be consumed by the war ourselves and presenting an image of it the so adequately corresponded to war although the storyline itself was not too impressive the content of the film was
<START> i love the mockumentary format that chris guest and crew have developed over the years i actually like this and waiting for guffman better than spinal tap which was the first of the group and made by rob reiner but starred guest and several other of his mockumentary regulars this humor is not for everyone it's rather subtle and not too physical so some people may not relate however as a dog lover and a dog show fan i loved this movie there are so many funny lines in it my daughter and i quote them to each other often i find it amazing that these people can ad lib so much funny material for each movie what a fun bunch they must be i highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side
<START> greetings again from the darkness director alejandro amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man's struggle to control his destiny the great javier bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as ramon his eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind the dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question the real question posed is what is love at every turn we see people in love looking for love or dying to be loved the script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room the supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with ramon's decision this is a gem and deserves to be seen
<START> this film is titled junior pilot here on imdb but final approach at netflix go figure the movie is a delight for both the target youth audience and for adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth for the adult the story is quite predictable and perhaps trite and melodramatic whereas the tale may seem new and creative to youngsters who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a story line br br in any case credit must be given to the film's creators particularly the director james and the cinematographer denis maloney for making this most entertaining and visually interesting film the cut aways to the young protagonist ricky's fantasy thoughts are hilarious as well as delightfully filmed br br the young actors give uniformly believable performances seemingly quite invested in their roles silly as many scenes are jordan garrett plays the protagonist ricky with quite well having excellent camera presence jeffrey creates a delightfully soft and sensitive shashi who of all ridiculous things thrives on hot sauce skyler and adam give solid performances as well br br as is typical of his always fine acting larry miller creates a solid parental figure around which the children's part real part fantasy world revolves compared to his father figure the other major adult roles appear to be shallow and one dimensional intentionally and quite humorously so to be sure br br this movie is a simplistic youth targeted story of course yet it is quite entertaining perhaps repeatedly so to the targeted youth crowd but also for at least one viewing by adults who retain the ability to view such a film from their once youthful perspective
