<START> i saw this movie on videotape with my younger brother a long time ago despite the fact i was a young boy who's hearing impaired i didn't have the closed captioning decoder at the time it was 1986 the year of the transformers the movie but i could follow the plot and understand what's going on it wasn't my fault i saw the animated movie intended for girls my father rented the video to show to my other younger sister br br a decade later and i rented the video for 50 cents to watch again with the closed captioning turned on my memories of this movie was utterly destroyed by none other than a wretched script i have seen plenty of poorly written movies like cool as ice and jason goes to hell the final friday but i have never seen or heard the dialogues this bad only with enough inanity to make your head spin from laughing in hysterics and screaming from the pain of enduring the torture of sitting through this movie despite good plot and intriguing story concepts the script has to be one of the worst ever written for the screen bar none the incompetent howard r cohen should never be working as a screenwriter professional or otherwise i can not believe they would even allow the terrible script to produce a movie like this in the first place did the japanese producers read the script in broken english or translated before they know what they were into even crap like g i joe the movie and my little pony the movie have redeeming values compared to this abomination br br if you're a big fan of 80s animation or just taking a nostalgia trip beware of rainbow and the star stealer it does not matter whether you were elated or traumatized by the sloppily animated movie with an atrociously written script or you have not seen the movie stay away from this movie the movie should be viewed with the to learn how not to write a bad script
<START> i have seen many of shahrukh's movies and this is a very good role for him he has such versatility but he mainly stays in positive roles as rahul he is very dark and disturbing yet i found myself sympathizing with him much of the movie if for nothing else watch this movie for shahrukh he plays a very complex and real character very convincingly the story is very typical and has been done before but the character development is very strong and entertaining the opening is a little confusing but by the end it doesn't matter the songs i found very likable and give insight to what characters are thinking very clever i think this movie was very good and recommend it to all shahrukh khan fans it is a must see
<START> i learned little of significance from this film that i did not already know from cnn and the new york times and i did not follow the enron case obsessively as did some others the film did a very poor job of explaining what business enron was in that might actually have been on the up and up before it started hiding its debts in the entities created by andy it also significantly underplayed the role played by arthur andersen and vinson in validating practices that were afterwards found to be illegal nor did it go as far as it might have in exploring what the investors all those prominent bankers thought they were doing with the 24 hour a day cable networks the discovery channel and the history channel documentaries have i've seen many in the past year that were better than this one
<START> tiny toons how i spent my vacation has always been my favourite animation movie and loved it since i first watched it when i was 7 or now i'm almost seventeen and i still love this wonderful work of art br br i really like the idea how we track what each of them did in their vacation and there were really some funny quotes said that really made me laugh a lot br br in this movie u'll never get bored and once u see it u'll want 2 c it again and again because believe me it's really wonderful and it's suitable for all ages
<START> mr moto's gamble has a fairly straight forward plot when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison it's up to the even more mysterious mr moto to solve the case br br i'm shocked at the number of positive reviews for mr moto's gamble on imdb because to me well i found it extremely disappointing i enjoy mr moto and i enjoy charlie chan but i can't say i cared for this mish mash of the two for those unfamiliar with the story behind mr moto's gamble it was originally intended to be a charlie chan film but when warner backed out some of the scenes and action were rewritten for peter lorre and mr moto as i indicated the end result left me underwhelmed mr moto is not chan he's more mysterious he's more athletic and he's more exotic so trying to put moto in a chan film is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole it doesn't work and listening to lorre moto try to deliver one of chan's trademark euphemisms just ends up sounding silly add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief 72 minute runtime is made up of boxing scenes something that i never seem to enjoy and you end up with a movie that i couldn't help but dislike if i have to say something positive i would point to the performance of keye luke but even he's not near enough to save mr moto's gamble in my eyes br br sorry but a 4 10 is about the best i can give this one
<START> for those who loved wayne's world the blues brothers and hell even raiders of the lost ark you will find much to like but probably not love in tenacious d the pick of destiny a fictional epic about the formation of the jb jack black kyle gass band two out of work losers with a love for rock n'roll are met with a dilemma when long supportive mother stops sending him rent checks jb and make tracks for the rock and roll hall of fame after a sage music store clerk an inspired ben stiller tells them about the titular pick a funny animated tapestry sequence gives the backstory along the way our zeroes encounter a snaggle toothed stranger a game tim robbins sasquatch stoner security guards sorority chicks and satan himself an ironically cast dave in a climactic sequence that has to be seen to be believed and preferably played at high volume rarely do i see comedies in the theater but pick is an extremely nice change of pace it may not go up to 11 but it hums a tune both crude and clever for a good 90 minutes and the songs are inspired low brow hilarity recommended br br 6 5 out of 10
<START> warning might contain spoilers br br i just sadly spent 5 bucks on this movie on amazon and i wish i never spent it i have never seen suck horrible special affects or acting i mean jack 0 is just a laughable monster and his costume looks like something u could buy at a halloween store or make yourself the acting is just horrible especially sean kelly i mean come on he is so pathetic with his little lines come get me low i laughed so hard on this its just stupid i mean the movie is so awful they had to put a few minutes of nudity in it just for people not to shut it off low i think the most laughable scene is when the woman sticks a butter knife in the toaster and gets electrocuted i mean come on that looked so fake and the dummy i could buy that at any halloween store or make it myself well i recommend not watching this cheesy movie cause it will be time you will never get back
<START> this is a pretty clever well acted version of the modern 30s woman's fairytale romance in this case she helps the man she loves become head of the company while serving as his secretary and eventually wins his love from a scheming social butterfly interestingly her business sense is shown as subtly parallel to her prowess and the ladies of the office are depicted as the powers behind the throne lifted way above the average by mrs intelligent performance
<START> omg what has disney done lately most of their new shows really suck suite life of zach and cody are pretty good but other shows like cory in the house wizards of waverly place suck and are unwatchable br br naturally sadie is just beyond stupid and dumb its about a teenager named sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life there are her friends margaret and rain and her older annoying brother hal there all annoying and stupid especially margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's soo pretty its just beyond awful i hate all the seasons of this show its just terrible in every way the first season was better though br br if you value your life you wouldn't watch this crap its painful and stupid
<START> i watched this movie knowing that it would be awful but damned if it didn't break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment the plot is deep rising with cruddy effects and horrid acting the lines in this well wow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the english language the sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good you won't believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it there are scenes plot devices straight out of deep rising alien jurassic park predator jeepers creepers and the list could go on forever however unlike any of those movies this one just falls short of celluloid stool the most incredulous thing about this film aside from the way it tries to be competent but fails is that gimli him freakin' self is in it how the hell can they afford john rhys davies but not decent effects writing actors or sets really awful and not the type of bad that's good
<START> this has always been a favorite movie of mine i've owned a vhs copy and a couple of months ago i found a dvd release which is also part of my video collection i also happen to be a huge baseball fan and as part of my off season reading i picked up a copy of robert excellent book you gotta have wa that profiles the ins and outs of japanese baseball and the challenges that foreign players have encountered playing in japan as i began to read yesterday it made me think of this movie because it appears the screenplay was based almost verbatim on this book the parallels are uncanny the jack elliot character closely resembles bob horner an aging slugger whose best days were behind him horner's teammate leon lee is also depicted in the character max hammer dubois a veteran in the japanese league who has made his peace with the frustrations of the japanese game and helps keeps his teammate sane the elliot character goes through the same sequence of encounters as horner from big fanfare signing early success that fuels an already ravenous sports media and the ensuing slump that spurs frustration alienation from teammates fans and media and the resulting disillusionment that prompts a desire to go back home to the us the only difference is that the movie adds such hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending br br speaking of love interests i'm sure many viewers have come to this site as i did to look up the actress who played the beautiful aya and what other work she has done it only lists this movie it turns out based on an article i read that the brief love scene she has with tom selleck a foreigner in this movie mild by our standards basically they kiss while he's in the bath and she's wearing a towel caused such an outrage on the part of the japanese public males in particular that she has never been offered another role of any kind in movies or television essentially blackballed by the japanese movie industry it's a real shame as she is was quite a talented actress in this movie br br if you like this movie as much for the baseball elements and cultural differences as i did go find a copy of you gotta have wa by robert whiting a good read and a great companion book to this movie
<START> i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christie's darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but it's my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret the closing scene between her and joan is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliant br br please let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine version is watch and enjoy
<START> this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review unfortunately both times they have been for movies that can be described with several 4 words that can be defined as or excrement the other movie of such calibre was masked and anonymous br br onto the review there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe below br br 1 steven has lost the plot i e in all his other movies family friend gets killed steven gets angry steven kills people the end br br 2 steven has run out of money there was a good car chase scene at the start but i think he blew his budget on that and couldn't afford a decent script writer or editor br br 3 steven no longer appears to do his own action instead the from memory 2 fight scenes were shot neck down and from the back so you couldn't actually see his face most likely a stunt double i'm guessing chuck norris br br in summary worst seagal movie ever second worst movie i have seen in recent history and i've seen a lot of bad movies
<START> as a fan of c j 's earlier movie latter days i really wanted to like this film br br the nicest thing i can say however is that it's not an awful film there are some good performances and a few funny scenes in particular tori spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fiancÃ©'s ex boyfriend br br overall though it's pretty week the script falls back on weird coincidences and clichÃ©d movie moments way too often the main character went to stanford on a golf scholarship and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game br br most of the time this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say there are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time and you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anything br br still for all it's faults i would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years which says a lot about how bad most gay films are br br i'm hoping c j 's next film will be better
<START> i've seen lonesome dove dead man's walk and the streets of and now the return to lonesome dove if you are hungry for more after watching lonesome dove this'll fill yer belly great cast great story most definitely a close second to lonesome dove i will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection this is the best or at least my favorite performance by jon voight he is captain call lou gossett jr playing pickett is not somebody i'd mess with he is a bad ass with perspective william peterson does a great job as well rick schroder is back as newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on nypd blue my only problem with this film and it's really picking nits is that i had the impression that call wanted to be the first man to cattle in montana and it's obvious that had already been there a while a little inconsistent but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale i especially love the apparent character growth of jasper and july johnson i've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel
