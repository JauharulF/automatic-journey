<START> found an old vhs version of this film in my parents house so i thought i'd give it a go right from the start i wasn't expecting much from this film and i'm glad for that because overall the film was no good br br the acting overall was very poor even for a nicolas cage movie one scene with a radio controller stands out as being so pitiful that i found it hilarious that this scene wasn't cut the first 30 minutes of the film had almost no developed plot and i didn't know what was going on br br the story itself had the possibility of being decent but either the director was just bad or was trying too hard to put his own unique touch on the style of the film i managed to watch the whole thing but i won't likely ever see this film again
<START> an excellent cast who do their best with an awful script inept direction and some of the worst score that i have ever heard more tv movie of the week than serious drama which is sad when one considers that the source material is very serious and very real the film makers decided that instead of building drama and character it was better to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hope that the audience would be shocked into sympathy and caring in my opinion one the most blatant forms of cut and paste film adapting
<START> george remake of his own superior film is a complete waste of time why was it even attempted kiefer sutherland plays jeff whose girlfriend sandra bullock who only has a small amount of screen time is abducted at a service station by barney cousins jeff bridges now barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of sundays he lopes about like frankenstein's monster but without the sympathy and bridges' acting is totally awful sutherland comes across a little better when his character turns detective with the help of new love interest rita baker nancy travis br br a major problem with this version of 'the vanishing' is its obvious need to cater to hollywood audiences by avoiding the bleak ending of the original film here the ending is happy which seems forced and unbelievable and completely wrecks the story however by this time the damage has been done as jeff bridges turns the bad guy into a huge laugh
<START> unfortunately this original mix of action and laughs is kept from cinema fans as it sits rotting in the columbia vaults for all eternity a shame since this may be jack strongest film and features a witty script by a young terrence malick and fully realized performances by its two leads stacey keach and frederic forrest who turn to a life of crime so they can get the money to open a seafood restaurant many standout scenes include interrogation by bathtub and electric razor and an intense shootout in an abandoned building as it's being torn down by a wrecking ball
<START> to soccer fans every where stay away from this movie it was so lame acting lame script lame soccer and no directing i rented this movie during my stint in asia and was appalled that this was considered one of the better singaporean films it was just nonsensical and thoroughly boring there are thousands of rich exciting stories in asia why write a bad story about over the top and stereotypical singaporeans
<START> remember when rick mercer was funny 22 minutes was a great show when rick mercer was on it and made in canada was a great show once too talking to americans was such a funny special too but like my friend said rick mercer woke up one day and wasn't funny any more i think that day was when rick mercer report went on the air what is the point of this show rick mercer reads wacky fake headlines shows pictures of bad sheds that people mail in and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30 minute show going somewhere and just talking to people hoping to say something witty or clever enough to get on tv and maybe even make somebody somewhere laugh we're supposed to be interested in seeing rick mercer visit a gymnastics team and then try to do some of their moves and then suck at it on purpose while trying desperately to be funny rick mercer got old or just lost interest or just ain't funny any more even his classic rant bits have lost all their bite and humor you can say that about cbc comedy in general though because how many years have they been sticking air farce on tv to deliver the same kinds of useless jokes
<START> this show paranormal state has an almost project feel to it as in you're watching a 'documentary' that's actually just a scripted movie made to look and feel like a documentary br br my biggest problem with the show is their 'go to' outside advisers of the warren's who were made famous for their of the amityville murders which were shown to be completely fraudulent just based upon the police reports of the family's deaths such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths then there's the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take they don't want to help those who need it most they just want the weirdest cases that will get them the most press and attention br br they're complete frauds plain and simple
<START> there seem to be many fans of this movie here but i found it boring slow meandering and pointless and i watch and enjoy plenty of art house and independent films so i wasn't expecting an action movie i didn't sympathize with either character the guy from the countryside was a bad guest and didn't seem to be trying very hard to find a job and his relative in istanbul was humorless and closed off emotionally br br in an interview on the dvd the director says that the movie is about a common situation in turkey the person leaving in the countryside because there are no jobs and coming to istanbul and staying with relatives while trying to find work that in itself is interesting but the movie wasn't
<START> this is an account of events that have been covered in print several times and i had read two books 'a voyage for and 'the strange last voyage of donald before seeing the film in sheffield just before christmas i must say it exceeded all expectations in its telling of the 1968 sunday times golden globe yacht race these men set out to do something that had never been done before with no support vessels wooden boats no satellite phones no gps and just their wits and skill to get them round the globe in one piece not to mention the months of solitude the thundering southern ocean little sleep and boats that were often literally falling apart around them br br this documentary is excellently put together in my opinion tightly edited well paced with superb narration the archive footage and the interviews are fascinating and bring the story to life clare interview footage is especially revealing and moving as she relates the events that led up to her husband donald departure from the doubts and fears in his mind and her reaction as subsequent events unfolded br br i was moved and had even shed a tear or two by the time the credits started rolling and overheard other people expressing similar feelings br br the two books i mentioned above are useful for more detail and back story which couldn't have been fitted into the 90 minutes and i would recommend those too br br this is ultimately a true story of human courage and human frailty a must see for anyone interested in sailing adventure human endeavour and real life heroes
<START> my husband brought this home from the video store so i could watch something while stuck home sick the sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book but a sorta silly light romantic flick sounds just right that and a bowl of chicken soup well he meant well br br my first thought as some others post here also was that the house must be fake it's not only isolated alone on the beach but set on into the loose sand and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house this looks so obviously dangerous in hurricane country in the fall so potentially disastrous that i was sure filmmakers had simply cgi'd the whole thing or used movie magic to plunk a cute b b into the surf br br but i have to tell you guys thanks to i can say that the house serendipity is very real is indeed near and except for some window dressing and shrubs appears mostly as it does in the film you can rent it yourself off season for a week or about in summer go for it but interestingly the house has severe problems the second thing that struck me after would be washed away was what about the plumbing electrical in that surf and sure enough serendipity was condemned for a break in the sanitation caused by from the ocean they are rebuilding br br and the house isn't from the civil war not to mention that viola davis playing clichÃ© black best friend thankless role for a fine actress last seen in doubt is not remotely old enough that her grandmother could have built anything in the civil war hello that was 150 years ago try great great great in reality serendipity was built in 1988 laughably recently br br the basic film is built on a typical nicholas sparks weeper which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable happenstance it is also aimed in a very pandering way towards women you know us women who love b bs antiques and knick who dream of romance and guys who look like richard gere and dancing in the moonlight don't give us plot or thoughtful character development just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenes br br gere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign on her cheek of course she died of an overdose of anesthesia so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist hello where is that guy why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty br br gere has come to pout and confront the woman's husband and is staying at the remote b b who should be there why the only other person in the inn diane lane she's a lonely divorcÃ©e with rotten kids and an ex hubby who wants her back while she's trying to decide about that the clichÃ© best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the b b br br now in the real world if this set up ever even happened the doctor would look like ernest borgnine and the lonely divorcÃ©e like rosie o'donnell he'd spend his vacation horndogging 22 year old girls on the beach while she sulked and thought about going on a diet but this isn't the real world i digress br br the couple confess all fall in love a hurricane hits they make love fall in love he has to go away he dies and she cries a lot about that the end br br there i've saved you from it now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances husbands sons boyfriends from sitting through this tripe very wearying br br someone else asked why diane lane a perfect tiny woman whom filmmakers seem to love to cast because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her but she's and not over the top so she isn't threatening is constantly covered in big tarp like shawls this would make sense if she was chubby but she isn't br br anyways someone throw a pretty paisley shawl over this film so we don't have to watch it conclusion read a book unless you are too sick if too sick go to sleep
<START> in moscow the priest owen vincent gallo hires a team to guide him in the underworld to find his friend sergei rade serbedzija that is missing while researching the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell beneath the city br br i bought this dvd based on the name of val kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover i am totally disappointed since this film is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i do not understand how val kilmer accepted to participate in this production there are two shameful reviews in imdb promoting this movie and they are typically fake written by users with only one review in this site there are two possible ways to see this boring and awful film my wife and i many times because of the monotony of this pointless story and we used the rewind button of the dvd to repeat each lost scene however the correct way should have been the use of the fast forward or the stop button to end this crap faster my vote is one br br title brazil dark city

<START> this film flopped miserably in the uk and it didn't deserve to the trailer of this film is slightly misleading and i guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was atonement part 2 while the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of joe wright's bafta winning film it's very different in tone it focuses on an imagination of sorts of welsh poet dylan thomas' life during the second world war as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to wales director john quickly introduces dylan's matthew ryhs childhood sweetheart vera phillips played by keira knightley she was dylan's first love in their homeland but the moment has passed and singer vera only wants it as a beautiful memory or does she vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in dylan's life queen of ireland love of my life mother of my child caitlin thomas sienna miller the three form a sort of menage a trois in war struck london but vera then falls for a dashing soldier william cillian murphy they quickly marry with leaving for war a frightened vera convinces the thomas' to return her to wales but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of vera's child william's jealousy and shell shock after returning home and caitlin realising she cannot share dylan with her best friend br br filmed on a low budget this is more of a mood piece than anything else it works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed the performance of sienna miller is particularly unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense detracts from the fact thats she's quite a talent and knightley and murphy are once again very good the let down is rhys as dylan who while the welsh poet himself was no bed of roses lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in dylan the writing is very choppy some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness it's certainly worth watching however
<START> a antique shop owner in nyc played by joanne whalley valerie gets put on a us district court jury on a trial of a known mafioso armand rusty and most of this very slow paced film revolves around attempts of attempting to get whalley to acquit him of murder by threatening to kill her son and herself much action ensues involving gruesome mob rub outs with willam hurt as the go between much of this silly disjointed mess surrounds hurt and obsession with whalley courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again and an ending that is unbelievable 3 10 is probably going easy on this waste of time
