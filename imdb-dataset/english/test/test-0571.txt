<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this made for tv movie i was channel surfing and came across the start of the movie boy am i glad i stopped this movie has a real hot cast as well as a semi believable plot there's drama comedy action and best of all the human nature aspect of this film is what makes it great i hope it comes out on video because i will buy a copy rating 9 out of 10 stars
<START> the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and passionately directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into it br br it's hard to place this movie under one label it's not really a drama it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesn't necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combined br br but just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and it's more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesn't make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute must see in parts the movie also feels as if it's trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifully br br it features some great camera work and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch br br 7 10
<START> while the david lynch version of dune is choppy awkward and unfaithful to the novel it is visually well designed and well acted the best one can say about the sci fi channel's attempt to make dune into a miniseries is that it's ambitious actually that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer the actors with few exceptions seem happy to recite their lines with the least emotion possible and the least appropriate accents the costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a a large surplus of fabric on hand and an unhealthy love of unflattering br br in part this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of lynch's already well known effort however it takes elements from lynch's film which were not present in the novel and copies them nearly wholesale i e the guild navigation sequence and this only encourages encourages negative comparison to lynch's film a for effort d for virtually everything else
<START> well i didn't know what to expect from 555 matter of fact i had never even heard of it until a few months ago but being a collector of just about all types of horror i figured i would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher br br basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row what the third 5 in the title means nobody knows anyway the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places he decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death after this he proceeds to rape the dead corpse the police think they have a lead on the killings but really have no idea what is going on how will they find the killer does anybody care br br this movie is filled with some of the worst actors i have ever seen no wonder none of these actors went on to do anything else literally the three lead actors consist of two detectives and a sexy female reporter i am being sarcastic when i say sexy she is about as un sexy as it gets the two detectives are like watching tweedle dee and tweedle dum one of them underacts his part and the other one may have gone to the shatner school of acting the acting is so bad that it almost forces you to lose your interest in the movie thus almost putting you to sleep br br the only thing holding this terrible movie together is a few decent gore scenes for a movie on this budget the makers must have put all of there money into the special effects which still aren't that great br br unless you are like me and have to own every single horror movie out there i would suggest steering clear of this movie 4 10
<START> well it is standard hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile off it's enjoyable in parts but just oh so predictable i must confess i did not really enjoy it but i am pretty tough to please and a lot of my friends loved it br br it is quite sweet and the actors give good performances it's a nice backdrop and the eye candy is pretty good but the irritatingly predictable unoriginal and really quite dull storyline holds the film back personally i can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my life br br the chick flick genre gets some bad press but there are some genuinely good chick flicks out there this isn't one of them
<START> chips is an excellent blend of music light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance by peter o' toole and and effortless romantic supporting performance by clark o' toole is able to show the shy uncommunicative teacher that wishes so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married katherine clark she brings him the world what a lot of flowers and he is forever changed he becomes the beloved headmaster of through tragedy but knows he could only have achieved his goal through love the songs with the exception of the music hall number are all thought songs coming from character's emotions and thoughts and the more you listen to them the more beautiful they become walk through the world with me and you and i o'toole's finest moment is the final speech he gives to the students it was the reason for the oscar nomination as a teacher we question what book learning ever gets through but as chips says we did teach them how to behave with each other and that is what really counts beautifully filmed perfectly orchestrated by john williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you did i fill the world with love the boys sing their school song by the end chips realizes he was able to do it but only cause catherine was there
<START> virtual sexuality proves that britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from america the only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits differently than an american film would and a cameo by ram john holder which is always welcome that's enough to make this a watcher on a cold winter's night
<START> a 1957 roger corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley sic just as stock footage nuclear heck is unleashed it's the end of the world four men with guns two women one an unmarried virgin the other a las vegas show who drinks and smokes guess which one makes it to the end of the movie time passes tensions develop or are supposed to something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits a mutant monster seven weeks of radioactive dust has performed a million years of evolution on an already living human the result is a laughably bad zip up the back rubber monster who is strangely scared of their only source of fresh water it rains the monster dissolves the remaining two characters the hunk and the virgin set out to repopulate the world as the caption 'the beginning' fills the screen after it transpires that the brief shower of rain had washed all the radioactivity away and dissolved all the monsters running around 'out there' br br the only thing of real note about this is the incredible amount of acting' that goes on in it one of the staple elements of bad and lo budget movie making of the period was the use of curtains in the set design it was cheap finished with one set up pull a curtain across drop a different piece of furniture in front of it and you have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting br br acting' is a skill in which the actor will get to comment on what's going on outside any building he happens to be in it looks like rain or here they come now and it looks like they've got the sheriff with them that sort of stuff he'll do this by standing to one side of the window reaching across his body and lifting the curtain away from the window but along the axis of the shot ie towards the camera thus enabling him to pretend to look out and tell us what's happening off screen without letting the audience see he's staring at the studio wall three inches away from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains there was a lot of that in this movie
<START> this two disc set is incredible if you're like me and never had the opportunity to actually see the band live then this is the next best thing jimmy page who in my opinion is the second best guitarist ever to walk the face of the earth second only to himself he puts on an amazing show in every piece of footage in this film john paul jones although not as up front as page puts on one hell of a show although in the live atmosphere his rythmic bass lines aren't as defined as they are on studio recordings except of course in songs like dazed and confused or what is and what should never be but his wide array of talent is well displayed in these dvd's john bonham is john bonham what can i say there is no comparison his beats stand out like no other and this dvd is proof last but not least robert plant wails like no other can wail if you've ever read hammer of the gods you'll be wondering the same thing as page was when he first met robert plant why the hell isn't this guy already famous and so concludes my review sorry about and spelling or grammar mistakes zeppelin rocks
<START> this was on scifi this past weekend and i had to check it out after all it was science fiction with vampires and erika eleniak what could go wrong with this b movie br br a lot br br to start with it can't even be classified as a b movie because that would put it in the same league as roger corman and this movie doesn't even meet his expectations the most money they spent was on the contact lenses for the vampires br br secondly the casting was horrible yes casting udo kier as the captain of the was a smart move but the director clearly couldn't even get kier to memorize his lines casting eleniak in a vampire movie is also a smart move because it means a bunch of horny guys are going to buy rent record this flick to watch her get seduced by a vampire but the director writer and producer screwed that one too granted they got some money out of the poor souls who enjoy watching vampire movies with hot women in them but no one is going to remember this movie in another two or three years br br thirdly little things that just emphasize the laziness in this movie for example van helsing calls a cross a crucifix and when mina is staked in the coffin the viewer can clearly see the fact that her chest is nothing more than pillows br br oh and one other thing why did they go for the george type dracula instead of something that would look decently scary does george hamilton have an overwhelming hold on our future why didn't everyone who saw dracula just laugh at him for his get up br br a waste of time even with a tivo remote in your hand
<START> this film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little average budget looks like van damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him there is your basic bar brawl alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting some basic drama but nothing too deep isaac florentine directs an ok action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it but the person who steals the show is br br scott adkins how come this guy isn't a massive arnold schwarzenegger caliber action star that i don't know director isaac florentine has made a movie with scott adkins before called special forces 2003 which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic another amazing scott adkins feature is undisputed 2 check this guy out and make a noise this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now br br what else can i say about the movie it's van damme stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work no oscars here for sure but you already knew that but never the less it has a nice little town feel and i could find worse ways to spend my time so i'm giving this a solid 7 out of 10 in it's genre
<START> it's rare that i get the opportunity to review a film for imdb that relates to my own life in such a close way however as someone living with cerebral palsy albeit less severe than michael one of the main characters in the film i don't wish to give this film a 'free just because it tackles a subject that's rarely approached and when it is is normally treated with po faced seriousness there were minor problems i had with the film and i'd like to address those first so that people are clear that it isn't my situation which has clouded my judgement of this overall excellent film br br parts of it i felt were unashamedly crowd pleasing at the expense of realism if i had a pound for every time a well meaning member of the public has mentioned electric wheelchair racing to me i'd be much the richer man but speaking personally that fits more into the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages rather than the reality of what actually goes on same thing with spending time watching disabled people go to the pub it's not a big deal to those of us who actually do it as much as it might be admirable for outsiders looking in i appreciate that this is from the previously sheltered perspective of michael but i still think he'd be concentrating more on enjoying the experience rather than reflecting on what a big deal it was that he was actually there in the first place as such the amount of time we spend seeing them have fun felt like a bit too much br br i felt that the terminal nature of illness was brought to our attention far too late meaning that it was just used as a cheap sentimental device to come between the pair rather than something everybody knew all along was going to have to be dealt with br br to balance those criticisms i have to dish out a heap of praise as well although i thought some scenes showing them getting to grips with normal life were a touch overdone the script also ventured into some tricky places i wouldn't have expected and comes out with a lot of credit for doing so for instance raising the issue of love and relationships and showing the daily apparatus often used to aid and assist the lives of non able bodied people also despite the blunt emotional shock tactic of death being sprung upon us the movie as a whole is far less sappy than anyone has a right to expect these type of films to be br br brenda fricker can and has been performing variations of her role capably on autopilot for what seems like years but robertson and mcavoy share a special interaction that must be noted inside i'm doing cartwheels that a group of people somewhere have finally made a film doing justice to the lust for life of many disabled persons
<START> heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks i wasn't expecting much but wow was i ever surprised it's a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle reminds me of for ps2 because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo sounds pretty standard but this movie is insane it's hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in 1952 also the king was probably one of the creepiest character's i've seen in a long time with a feminine walk weird eyes usually crossed and a soft but scary voice the only problem i had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr a large talking green bird to save them the animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked it's incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even laugh out loud funny at times it's a real shame this is such an obscure title because it's really a good film check it out sometime
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br as a boy mark goddard c thomas howell sat powerless as his family including his hero cop father jeff fahey were brutally murdered by vicious criminals he'd tried to bring down with an inner desire to punish wrong doers festering in him as he grew up as a result of this mark employs tough means when bringing the suspects he's chasing down in and gets into a lot of trouble with his superiors because of this but then he learns of a secret group of men and women lead by a mysterious man ed lauter who serve to dish out punishment that fits the crime outside the law but then things get out of hand and getting out alive might be harder than he thought br br the sweeper gets into problems from the off set because we've seen this exact same plot done before and better in films like the star chamber with michael douglas and magnum force with clint eastwood the title doesn't make any sense either but we also have to contend with the movie's utter ludicrousness including a scene where a daughter's manages to drown out the sound of her family being slaughtered a finale involving a chase with a bad guy that starts on the freeway and ends on a wright brothers plane as well as some of the most ridiculous acting ever put on screen and a very clichÃ©d pretentious script but there's some cool action sequences here and there and the movie's unintentional laughs factor certainly keeps it alive with a pulse
<START> it opens and for half an hour runs like an educational programme on the old testament although not without humour the movie finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant gets dropped in a scene of mixed success martin donovan jesus decides to on kicking off the apocalypse and the final quarter of an hour is a sort of humanist 'what's all the fuss about ' play out gilded with optimistic against a retrospectively miserably ironic long shot of the wtc twin towers br br apart from authority the acting is split there's the thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast this though formally contrived for biblical presentation is appropriate for the modern paranoid comedy that hartley's aiming at but i was also pleasantly surprised at the contribution of pj harvey credited thus and in danger of existing within the film solely as the pop star entity she is not least in a set piece scene in a record store and a perilously patchy soundtrack to which contributes she remained cool a sort of disingenuous lack of focus in the manner of many pop icons who have taken to film i'm thinking the jagger of performance here but nonetheless maintained a convincing integration with both cast and project br br ultimately affirmative but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and relies more on the perseverance than the imagination of its audience 4 10
