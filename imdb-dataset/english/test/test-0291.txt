<START> this is defiantly a dvd rental movie i'm a big fan of the cast members but the storyline never really grabbed me don't expect oh brother where art thou in any way shape or form funniest part in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens over in the seems like they were trying to copy some of clooney's funny facial expressions from oh brother where art thou but you could kind of tell they were trying for that john was the bright spot and was solid throughout renee zellweger plays the part of a zealous reporter willing to do whatever for the story overall it's a movie worth watching at home
<START> this is a cute film starring spanky and buckwheat from the our gang comedies set in the south during the civil war it may seem a little odd to see buckwheat as spanky's slave but this film is as charming as the best of the shorts with the same cast this was the only our gang feature film and i highly recommend it over the little rascals remake from 1994
<START> this movie like so many others remember the titans miracle follows the basic sports movie formula there's a guy he's a jerk jerk does bad jerk must play by someone else's rules someone else's rules change jerk jerk becomes good insert tragedy death drugs riots etc tragedy effects jerk makes him totally change jerk must now play championship game lots of close ups on the sweating players and the balls jerk wins quote from coach or news or something that explains title credits weren't you touched these movies can now be used to sort out the morons of society anyone who pays to see this in theatres must be slapped
<START> ten years ago i really wanted to see this movie on the cinema but i missed it and then forgot about it oh boy am i glad this movie didn't get to ruin my teenage eyes back then br br i saw it yesterday and seriously this must be among the 10 worst movies ever made and i'm talking about movies which has had too much attention such as those wonderful trailers on tv and too much money spent on actors and the making of the movie br br the script sucks and the acting sucks even worse do i need to say more br br please hollywood no more arnold
<START> angela sandra bullock is a computer expert but being shy and somewhat of a recluse she does all of her work from the confines of her condo just as she is about to take a vacation in mexico a co worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash angela heads to mexico but takes the disc with her while she is sunning on the beach a terrific looking gentleman named jack jeremy northam makes overtures to her she falls for them and the two end up on a boat to however jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it even after angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the usa jack makes things difficult he changes angela's identity on every computer across the nation making her lose her condo her bank account everything can angela a computer whiz beat jack at his own game this very exciting movie has many assets first bullock and northam are two very beautiful interesting actors and their presence adds immediate the script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today's world the costumes sets production and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful and despite how it sounds there is a great deal of exciting action as angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy if you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence this is a great choice it delivers twists and turns with great frequency making it possible for the viewer to net a very good evening of entertainment
<START> this is easily one of the worst films i've seen in many years i started viewing the film not expecting much and that is exactly what it delivered not much in fact it ended up delivering even less than i expected my first reaction when i saw the opening portions of the film was that i would probably end up rating it a 4 i thought that it seemed to have reasonably good photography and a haunting atmosphere br br as the film progressed however the rating kept going down and down in my mind mainly due to pedestrian acting and a plot that went from being just plain silly and tasteless at the beginning to being both silly and repugnant near the end by the time the movie was over i was willing to rate it no more than a 1 br br don't waste your time or money on this one
<START> gray can make the english language jump through hoops like none other he recounts a number of events tied together by his writing of a manuscript the monster of the title some sad some uproariously funny all in his characteristic sarcastic manner if you liked swimming to cambodia you will love this one i actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than swimming to cambodia a real masterpiece
<START> whoever plays the part of j douglas williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job he apparently received no credits too bad br br all the dead end kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry it is odd to watch them in a western setting with their brooklyn accents i guess that should be bowery they even show some swimming abilities br br i think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing love crime story my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film busby berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when john garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move the camera moves up to his face i will not give away why or when but the look on his face at that point probably brought the 1939 audience to its feet in the theaters br br some will think john garfield looks a lot like frank sinatra in many scenes just his face actually frank was not yet making movies so maybe frank looked like john the boxer named smith in the movie looks like a clone of ed begley jr br br now i must tell you something that is not a spoiler but if you watch the movie watch grandma's hands may robson does her part well she seems to have hands that wander a bit in a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer's john garfield dressing room watch where she touches the reclining john garfield while he is wearing only his trunks br br a great ending lots of wonderful characters br br best line might be at the gas station eight gallons that's a dollar twenty eight tom willett
<START> having only seen five episodes of the show before this i've been watching the repeats on bbc two i haven't really had much experience of the league but as a fledgling fan as well as a massive fan of british comedy i can say this film is hilarious seeing herr who i had not seen on screen before the film briss and geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience being on screen is something that the league take full advantage of with heads blowing up it'll come as a surprise who it is and gruesome murders with random middle ages style battles all the way br br geoff is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists in this film because he has the best one liners and overall behaviour just like in the series one of my only disappointments with the film was not hearing geoff shout well now i've got this gun even once even though there is a build up to it in one part of the film the film itself overall is to use the phrase everyone else does and it's very reminiscent of films like life of brian appearances from tubbs and edward were welcome but papa lazarou's line hello daves cracked me up more than anything said by them lazarou's probably my favourite vasey character after tubbs and edward it's got quite a poignant ending with one of the main character being killed off and i can only hope this is not the last on screen vasey venture with gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or film i'm now very excited this is a film i will see again partly because the projector died towards the end leaving out 10 minutes or so of the film but mainly because it's inventive and hilarious i'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the tv series because i loved it br br one thing though if you've never seen the league you'll still love it but dave knows what you'll think about the people who make this stuff up as tubbs or edward might put it it's a local film for local people and a precious thing at that br br out of 4 5
<START> this show reminds me of an episode of the simpsons where had just been fired by mr burns and was forced to live a miserable life being unemployed all he did to while the way the hours was to drink and watch comedy central the implication was that comedy central was a pathetic tv channel for miserable people with nothing else to occupy their time mind of mencia is slightly better than most of comedy central's programming but it still serves as an example of why this channel is low quality filler for people with absolutely no lives br br truth be told mencia is a fairly competent comedian who throws out trite soft ball ethnic jokes and cashes in on bland stereotypes of people based on their race gender or economic status or a combination of two out of three of these characteristics if you've heard one of these jokes by one of your friends at a bar or at work believe me you've heard what passes as comedy on mind of mencia carlos also tries to make fun of current events but lacks creativity or originality this is not to say that carlos is a washout all the time i found some of his skits amusing such as his rap video portrayal as an oil sheik if you find bland run of the mill comedy up your alley you'll probably enjoy mind of mencia for those people who are tired of repetitive pedestrian comedians trotting out the same old time worn jokes stay away
<START> this movie was well done it covers the difficulties a returning vietnam veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war unfortunately the writers chose to focus on a vet who had been involved in an act of atrocity i was in vietnam and only once heard of such an act by one who witnessed it the offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in leavenworth br br the notion that only vets involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a disservice to all who served all of the soldiers i knew personally or knew of by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed they were there to halt the spread of communism the biggest problem was coming home to learn that many americans were opposed to the war that is what caused many veterans to feel they had taken part in something less than honorable not the manner in which they served br br the ending depicted the father acting more as a belligerent bully than a loving caring father for that i gave it a 7 out of 10 had the ending allowed for a degree of acceptance i could have rated it a 9 br br most decent men will come home from war with guilt and emotional scars they need acceptance and understanding to overcome that i pray that the public is more understanding of our present day veterans than it was in the the vietnam era
<START> the last dinosaur was one of those out of nowhere movie of the week films in the 1970's that was pretty exciting for the time especially to fans of japanese films originally slated for a theatrical release around when the dino king kong was out in the previous december it was suddenly pulled and made into a friday night abc movie of the week rankin bass who were no strangers to japanese co productions were the guns behind this production co produced with productions of japan the people who brought us in various forms starring mostly an american cast including the late richard boone joan van ark and the late steven keats it told the tale of a prehistoric pocket of time in what was a volcanic somewhere at the frozen arctic circle containing dinosaurs it plays a lot like the films the land unknown 1956 and the land that time forgot 1975 in feel and pace sure the dinosaurs were guys in suits a triceratops with front knees but they were filmed in such a way the music and score was so well done and the cast did a fine job that this didn't matter much to many of us brought up on godzilla the film has a lot of class to it from the opening score by nancy wilson the last dinosaur to the overall big feeling of the film the locations at hot springs in northern japan were excellent and lush and the undeniable feeling of kaiju to it there are some amazing set pieces the t rex's bone yard and a tracking shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see the t rex eat a giant fish from a stream fx people did their job in style here and aside from a few dodgy matte shots they do their job well this film is considered the best 1970's kaiju film from japan even over the five godzilla films made during that decade rankin bass did several other co productions with providing the creatures or miniatures the bermuda depths 1978 and the ivory ape 1980 but neither measured up to the epic look of this film
<START> when i first watched this film i thought that it would be rally good because it featured my favourite actor of all time he gives a sterling performance though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the work he is the only good thing in it you're into explosions and american dream working class hero trash which i'm not br br i don't get it how can this film get away with being so that bit with the little boy being rescued i mean come on you can't tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire guy wearing any goggles i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can't see for more than a couple of feet infront of you and no breathing equipment he'd have choked after 2 minutes this film was just bad ok br br why robert br br sorry if this is your favourite film
<START> i have copied my video of this on to dvd so that i can enjoy it whenever i like and it makes a very successful and rare wedding present as well this is just an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a much loved novel everything about it is just perfect and it has aged amazingly well there is always a chance with something this old that it might appear a bit creaky next to more modern dramas but more than holds its own br br the quality of the acting is amazing with janet mcteer making a superlative prudence and a young clive owen stomping around as the taciturn gideon br br i challenge anyone to watch the final sequence without at least a little at the sheer romance of it all it is the perfect film to watch when it is cold outside and you are snuggled up on the sofa br br i really can't recommend this highly enough
<START> leatherheads is an apt title however a leather strap would be more useful to self oneself after purchasing a ticket to watch this noxious attempt at entertainment clooney's attempt at self deprecating humor comes across with a quiet thud as his demeanor implies that he is anything but perhaps with another actor playing the clooney role the movie might be marginally palatable sorry george i doubt there will be any oscar nods this time george clooney is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to comedy unless you are referencing to his politics anyway only the most ardent of clooney fans will enjoy watching leatherheads everyone else will long for the days of the silent picture
