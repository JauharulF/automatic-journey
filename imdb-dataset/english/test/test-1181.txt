<START> the fact that this film was distributed free with a certain national newspaper which i do not care for did to a degree put me off of watching it but as i had come across a copy that a local charity shop was giving away for nothing i felt i could watch it with a clear conscience br br the film does have its moments the evocation of the location is nicely done but it does suffer i feel from a few too many faults firstly vinnie jones is simply not convincing as the journalist whilst vinnie himself is an interesting character the truth is that he simply does not have the range of acting ability to pull off a role like this br br secondly who would carry around with them a lost manuscript that they have been informed is priceless it seemed that everywhere mr jones went this manuscript went with him thirdly the whole dickens aspect of the story whilst appearing to be important gets in the way of what could have been an interesting film of corruption in high places maybe i'm just a bit thick but i really could not see the point of the story within a story dickens style this added nothing to the film and only served to confuse matters when things started to become interesting within the modern day story line br br the one bit of praise i will give the film makers is that at least they did attempt something a little different i am all for british independent films that try to be 'out of left but this is not a 'red road' or 'this is england' what it is is a bit of a mess and an over long one at that yes it entertains in part but in the end it felt like two films merged together to make a whole and failing both by doing so also i can not help think that i have seen something similar done recently on tv by ian banks set in edinburgh with a story concerning sir arthur conan doyle the creator of sherlock holmes
<START> this is basically just a dumb chase story nearly identical to zillions of other chase stories in terms of acting suspense plot dialogue characterization or lack thereof and pacing br br the one area in which 'the diverges from traditional chase movies is in its subject material computers unfortunately the scriptwriters clearly didn't understand the differences between a pocket calculator and a cray br br computer newbies shouldn't watch this movie because it will make them paranoid about computers no matter what hollywood tries to tell us it's just not that easy to erase someone's identity by hacking there's still too much paper documentation in the world and there was even more of it in 1995 br br computer pros shouldn't watch this movie either i mean a magical virus that can melt your entire pc when you press escape please and the whole virus including the cool multimedia effects of your screen dissolving what's that all about can fit on a single 1 yeah whatever
<START> victor jory never became a major star he is better known for later character roles than for his early leads but he was very handsome and an excellent actor br br his love scenes with loretta young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate their kisses look very real and very modern br br vivienne osborne is a standout here also she plays a woman with a reputation but the character has a good heart br br the print i saw was not clear but what a joy that rare movies like this are turning up and they are in some sort of watchable condition still intact this is nothing truly special but if one is willing to sift through movies of its era with similarly intriguing titles one is likely to find some movies
<START> this drama apparently caused a bit of a stir six years ago when it debuted on television not taking in much tv news myself it passed under the radar but after having seen it i'm not surprised that it did cause a stir not particularly because of the content although it is a bit more than the usual tv fodder it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country anyway this three part series is based on a book by sarah waters and puts its main focus on lesbians although the plot also has room to explore some other 'dark' sides of sexuality our main character is an oyster girl named nan short for nancy from winchester she is bewitched by female to male drag performer kitty butler after seeing her at a theatre show and soon begins attending all of her shows eventually catching the eye of the performer and becoming her dresser it's not long before kitty is offered a chance to play on bigger stages in london and having become good friends with nan she invites her along for the ride the act gets bigger when nan takes to the stage also and the pair becomes a stage duo but kitty breaks heart leading her into an odyssey within london's seedy underbelly br br i must admit that my dvd collection contains no shortage of sleazy and sordid films so there wasn't anything in this one that was enough to shock me despite being rather jaded to it i have to say that i'm still surprised at anyone who says this film went too far naturally there is some lesbian sex and other stuff but it's never exploitative or overused and the film really couldn't have been made without it the main focus is always on the story and the story is really well done the film is almost three hours long in total but if anything that isn't long enough to get everything across sarah waters is obviously an inventive writer and the film remains interesting for the duration the acting is solid as you would expect but i must admit that i found lead actress rachael stirling awkward and hard to get on with at first although she grows into her role well as the film progresses the execution is a little bit of a problem and director geoffrey sax is a bit too gimmicky for my liking the story does get a little bit sappy towards the end also which is a shame because this film is at it's strongest during the dark moments episode 2 being the high point of three for me there's not really a defined point to the film or at least not one that i could see that's not important as far as i'm concerned however as tipping the velvet tells a good story and more than surpassed my expectations worth checking out for people that like this sort of stuff
<START> the basis for this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players ever br br is a tight cohesive biopic of a true poker ace whose life is a one way trip down the highway to hell with few detours br br this dramatic feature stands wide apart from other films about poker it represents a rare and earnest attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of ultimate gambling compulsion the complete obsession that annihilates any proximity of spirituality and nullifies any chance of redemption this is the least likely movie a vegas casino executive would recommend and it is the sole poker dvd you are likely to find on the shelves of gamblers annonymous br br there are scenes in this movie that poker buffs are sure to refer to as some of the best gambling scenes ever stu reading his hand and particularly a texas bluffing scene br br early on in the movie we see a young stu bullied out of his pocket change by a bunch of neighborhood hoodlums poker is for loners seeking revenge it is a game of patience which bullies lack 'you can't bully me ' may very well be an underlying sentiment of the punishing force that a champion poker player unleashes upon his adversaries br br conservatives will look upon this film as a cautionary tale of a soul lost in sin they may evoke mark twain 'the best throw at dice is to throw them away ' the young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplistic and sympathetic outlook they may not have heard of twain's quote but will sure remember a remark made by stunned pal who learns from up and coming that he'd won a car from a local character in an overnight game 'you to go to hell and they look forward to the trip' br br the mosaic of las vegas vignettes that we see in will long linger in memory frank sinatra the most generous tipper forget about it nobody tips as extravagantly as a hot shot gambler and for vegas visitors who may not know the impact of tipping on the quality of their stay check out the scene of stu checking in a vegas hotel br br 'this is what i was meant to do this is where i was to be movie stars in hollywood politicians in washington and gamblers in vegas '
<START> i picked up this movie because it caught my eye as movie with a jewish comedy focus something i had not seen before br br i approached this film with an open mind and was interested in the way it began the opening is well put together and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh and this is good br br however the humor soon became repetitive the plot became confused and strained and i realized i was no longer enjoying the film i have tried to avoid saying this but the movie became rather cheap not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up but it didn't i confess that i may have missed some of the humour not being jewish myself and having little experience with jewish culture however considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of the humour was in this film it's unlikely i missed much br br the idea is a good one and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through i wish i could give the movie a higher rating but strictly speaking it would have been better as a tv series or as a series of skits there was just not enough worthwhile fresh material for a full length movie br br one thing to say about the casting the lead role looked as if it had been designed with ben stiller in mind but i don't think the movie would have been any more worthwhile if he had been in it

<START> i was kinda surprised by the pg rating on the back of the dvd case i certainly wouldn't want my kids watching this one i think this would scare the crap out of a 10 year old br br plot a girl trying to fit in to the clique is hazed and tormented by the 'in crowd ' they talk her into spending the night in this creepy mausoleum that reminded me of phantasm and they proceed to torment her in the night little do they know a recently deceased clairvoyant is coming back to life and raising the dead around them it sounds awfully cheesy but given the age and the budget which was no doubt pretty small this film is fun on many levels br br watch for an early eg daily as one of the in crowd brats i enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend br br 7 out of 10 kids
<START> this was an 1970s type irreverent comedy poking fun at the psychiatric profession and at beverly hills i didn't mind that but i did object to more that irreverence regarding marriage and religion two topics which secular filmmakers meaning about everyone in hollywood and elsewhere just can't stop trashing br br walter matthau plays a scuzzy character donald becker who walks around with a collar on which offends me but when has hollywood ever been worried about offending christians br br anyway despite that nonsense the film has its entertaining moments and even some charm to it dan aykroyd is good at paying a nut case and donna dixon laura rollins is a knockout i am sorry she didn't have a bigger role
<START> i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film i enjoyed it its a sci fi film if you want a thriller watch another channel this is what the scifi lovers want excellently produced by one of sci fi's best producers scot ok the special effects weren't excellent but what a great cast some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films films like mission impossible and braveheart are great but these aren't sci fi films sci fi produces excellent films like sabretooth alien hunters etc well done keep them churning out
<START> aaa is my favorite movie i have seen it a number of times don't remember the count now and every time i just love it this is the best movie of raj kumar santoshi the comedy dialogues and performance is amazing all the actors and actresses have done a superb job you cannot stop laughing while watching this movie its just hilarious amir khan and salman khan have done a great job and acting by paresh rawal was excellent as always the music is inspired from the old hindi movies 60s music and is good the entire cast of the movie has done great job br br overall its a great indian comedy movie to watch
<START> i'm not even going to waste more time describing how bad this movie is bottom line it was horribly acted had enormous plot holes and went absolutely nowhere the only good thing about it was the description my digital cable gave for the movie a married man with a struggling business has a fling with his secretary huh wrong movie apparently although it may have made things slightly more interesting if any of the description were true br br shelly
<START> of all the major 30s star actresses miriam hopkins has been the most bizarrely overlooked and underrated her string of excellent 30s and 40s films is quite impressive but she is often referred to as stagy or brittle yet she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies including this film old acquaintance with bette davis and the smiling lieutenant with maurice chevalier and claudette colbert hopkins was famous for her dislike of hollywood and the results has been a bad rep undeserved br br in wise girl she play an heiress trying to rescue the children of her dead sister from their guardian the sister's brother in law ray milland the film offers several hilarious scene such as hopkins taking a bath is a hopkins joining milland and guinn williams in a greenwich village restaurant for 3 apiece to act as bohemians and hopkins going ringside during one of williams' fights milland is also excellent and very funny br br hopkins and milland make a great couple the film also boasts solid support from williams walter abel henry stephenson james finlayson margaret dumont grace hayle leonid and inez the two girls are ok br br but hopkins drunk on a slice of wine and wearing a pinned together dress that is twice her size is hilarious as she blows at stray hairs while smoking a scream
<START> i originally watched this because i thought it was going to be the sequel to the league of extraordinary gentlemen and this movie is a whole different thing entirely going on here a comedy however i loved it anyways br br the league of gentlemen is apparently some british tv series with some rather odd characters and some sharp humour this is british comedy so it revolves around being very silly dressing up in costumes and making lots of fun of germans and french homosexual references in short it's very very funny br br the plot revolves around the writers of the tv show deciding to cancel some of the characters and the characters coming out of their dimension into the writer's dimension to stop that from happening it's a fun twist and there's plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure i laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humour this makes mr bean look like the watered down wimp he is rowan is much better in black adder series btw br br this is not monty python but you can never escape the comparison when you are talking british humour and there are a few similarities but not so many as to keep it from being it's own thing and being fresh it leans more towards the young ones and guest house paradiso in its' comedic style br br if you liked this check out the young ones series and guest house paradiso movie and of course i assume the tv series league of gentlemen must be rather funny as well
<START> this is an ok adaptation of the breath taking book of dan brown i can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy given the excellent story the result could have been better though the movie is pretty long but at the end i was feeling like some things were missing sound effects and sound tracks were very good acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak for people who didn't read the book things may look happening too quickly from my point of view instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper what makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of vatican you see neither of it in the movie too much rush and using the time not in a good way these are main problems of the movie so it is worth watching but could have been done better
