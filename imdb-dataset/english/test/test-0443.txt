<START> rko was trying to boost its starlet joan fontaine when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong willed enough to make a doctor john beal come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer tcm aired it as a stepping stone in the career of joan fontaine br br fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job nothing more and john beal is okay as her love interest but it's obvious that philip huston who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young james garner is the actor who should have shared top billing with fontaine whatever happened to this handsome actor why didn't rko promote him along with fontaine he showed skill as a light comedian br br these are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as i watched this rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promise of its title the story itself is rather tiresome only occasionally coming to life because of fontaine's spirited heroine br br she photographs prettily as the nurse and wears her serious expressions skillfully suggesting that there was more to be tapped at a future date beal never did go on to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why strictly lackluster br br but whatever happened to philip huston evidence here is that he should have had a worthwhile film career br br trivia note watch for dwight frye of dracula as the out of control patient aboard the airplane
<START> danny lee's performance as a wisecracking cop is the only spot of interest in this film even though it has an excellent cast including chow yun fat lau andy lau on and alex man plays a triad boss who wants to settle down to a life of peace and plenty but alex man a total psycho who has a big grudge against won't let him tries to escape to but to no avail after his family is blown to bits his cronies dead or turncoat wounded and broke returns to hong kong to get into some serious revenge br br it sounds a lot better than it is is well dressed and handsome looks pained grimaces and cries on cue but somehow or another you just don't care andy lau looks great but that's about it lau has a tiny tiny little part which was nice but she gets a bullet in the head early on so that ends that alex man is a cartoon villain he's so over the top which at times can be intriguing but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a garden variety nut br br danny lee is great though too bad he's only a small blip on the screen of this dark literally and essentially boring movie br br rent it don't buy it or just skip it altogether br br this is the sequel to rich and famous even though it apparently was filmed simultaneously it was released first because of power
<START> this off beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews my question is why i think this movie is pretty good dee snider did very well for his first and only time directing he also plays the antagonist captain howdy this movie seems to have a view of the future although it came out back in 1998 it seems to be about modern issues internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here although taken to another level this is an issue which we still face today i'll admit the story fell short a few times but that doesn't make this a bad movie at all robert englund is even in this movie that automatically makes it better the acting wasn't bad the characters were pretty good as well was a pretty good antagonist i think i give this off beat horror a 7 10 recommend for fans of saw
<START> this is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is what is shown is the incredible poverty in sicily as the 19th century gave way to the 20th a life style that made people dream of the 'new' world of america the mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet just a stone cottage set amid the harsh unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass an opening sequence sees the mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for a that they should set out for the new world or remain where they are it further shows life aboard the liner huddled masses indeed yearning to breathe free and conditions in ellis island where their journey still not over they are interrogated and examined to prove their to enter america what is not shown is the ship in longshot or indeed any shot that would identify it as a large ocean going liner what is also not shown is anything that would identify america no clichÃ© view of new york harbour and the statue of liberty so that ellis island could be anywhere in any country perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a camera crane looking down on hundreds of people jammed together slowly almost imperceptibly two thirds of the people at screen left begin to separate from the third at screen right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the dock a powerful statement of society being fragmented there's a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgam of typical families conditions at the time with almost nothing happening in dramatic terms it's not for the popcorn brigade at the multiplex but for the rest of us it's a very fine film indeed
<START> first off i am critical of this movie because i really had high hopes and instead this movie sucked br br possible spoilers if you haven't seen the tv series where to begin well let's start at the quality the movie was barely better than the original tv series and the two fight scenes were very nicely crafted however the cgi was horrid br br then there is the plot holes and questions that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done this movie does not close off as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe known as and only returns to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing but our imaginations to decipher what would happen in the future br br and then there is the stories biggest fault adding wwii and hitler why the series was perfect and didn't need hitler it didn't even need germany br br overall the entire movie was sorely lacing in what a true movie could have been and if i were the directors i'd scrap cos and make a new more ending ending
<START> i won't bore you with any synopsis chances are you already know them and hopefully you are already familiar with park chan work br br i strongly disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah because you know what he has the vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with how can you even compare the and subtlety of sympathy for mr vengeance with the frantic and extravagance of oldboy park chan wook has incredible style but his movies don't all share the same style that has been true and remains true with the release of thirst br br thirst is an incredible picture it literally has everything you want in a movie jaw dropping violence tasteful gore great humour incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes the story is so crazy that at no point can you guess what will happen next i'm so happy to say that park is back in top form with this fantastic dark comic vampire love story watch it as soon as you can
<START> antonioni with wim wenders some of the best of the best story character visuals like most of their works it is not really aimed at the children or the childish don't miss the genius contained in this one
<START> i really wanted this to be good as i am from liverpool where it is set but it truly awful the acting from everyone involved is cringeworthy the script is terrible absolutly terrible terrible
<START> i think this film version of northanger abbey is actually quite good it certainly is amusing well it's not a masterpiece as pride and prejudice '95 but there's very good stuff in it especially the city of bath setting the royal crescent the roman baths the fascinating georgian atmosphere that is excellent if you are a bath fan like myself you'll love watching this film the performances may sound a bit too melodramatic but i've got the impression that this film like the novel itself is deliberately making fun of the popular tales of romance and terror and of the society of the period the only drawback is probably the female lead as i personally have another idea of catherine physical appearance the music is also a bit unusual but i strangely find it acceptable despite it's got nothing to do with the historical period portrayed i'm wondering what would dear old jane think
<START> this is one of those movies that go out of print and are very expensive on ebay this movie is a little known fairly amateurish flick that has the strong advantage of being the only movie that shannon appears in multiple nude scenes looking very seductive i might add it also has the minor advantage of being popular in the fetish shannon and smoking fetish arenas it's a fairly mediocre attempt at a horror drama whodunit movie it tries a little misdirection but you can see what's coming a mile away shannon does a decent job with her role but the woman playing her sister is straight out of amateur night as is husband character avoid unless you're one of the groups i mention above now let's hit ebay and see if we can unload this thing 8
<START> dee snider was inspired to do a two part song by a horror movie this movie he wrote directed produced and starred in details the subjects from those songs horror from stay hungry people have commented he must have a sick mind to put something like this out i don't hear anybody making comments like that about stephen king wes craven dean koontz or in his own time alfred hitchcock the movie profiles a modern psychotic created by current trends in society personally i thought it was pretty well done from sheer imagination and inspiration also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims criminals this movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you cringe about the possible and probable it could happen
<START> a delta force army unit assigned to find a batch of missing green beret bad asses not known for going completely missing will be in a fight for survival against a cloaked skeleton man the supposed spirit of an ancient indian warrior who was revived when archaeologists disturbed his grave the skeleton man rides a horse and has the ability to propel to and fro using a type of dimensional portal and seems unaffected by bullet fire and explosives the skeleton man's horse leaves no hoof prints and he can ride from behind and around his prey silently the film's point of view through the skeleton man's eyes looks at his prey with a different color in other words he's not seemingly human so how can captain leary michael rooker as grizzled and intense as ever and his gang of would be commandos stop this menace for some reason the skeleton man murders employees of a nearby chemical plant what are the skeleton man's motives for slaughtering endless human beings and why is a blind indian living in the forest our commandos inhabit spared if the skeleton man as a human slaughtered his entire tribe to prove himself br br as completely stupid as it sounds just unbelievable horrible this is the kind of film that can brain cells casper van dien gets second billing in the credits just under rooker yet is saddled with a ridiculously underwritten character who exits the film quite early rooker deserves better than this if i were an actor i wouldn't want this movie in my resume the skeleton man is a reject knight from a de film he has a spear which can merely knock certain people down while exploding the head of a woman on impact an arrow shot from the skeleton man's bow actually destroys the propeller of a chopper plane for nearly 99 of the film bullets are shot at the skeleton man and he can go in and out of that portal thingee yet at the end all of a sudden he becomes vulnerable to attack oh and the horses also change as the skeleton man freely moves through the forest from that portal the film is written and edited by clowns the attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters who are supposed to be experienced pros make really bad decisions throughout this film the mind boggles with this film good for some laughs and some gore scenes make this hunk of pure crap watchable as a trash movie
<START> it's too slow paced and complex for children and too lightweight and dull for adults none of our family 6 weeks to 66 years could be bothered watching it all the way through br br are there jokes in it i couldn't really tell there was certainly some unnecessarily adult innuendo there was probably a bludgeoning message of sorts but i wasn't engaged enough to care br br the live talent are just stumbling and mugging their way through it i have to wonder if they were actually being paid or whether it was some form of community service or plea bargain br br please keep watching whines daniel honestly i wouldn't bother
<START> this movie i totally not funny and i would imagine to be pretty offensive to jewish people and i am not jewish why first the whole movie portray the protagonist zucker as a cheat running shady business and deals while his son is gay his daughter is lesbian and his niece is a slut then there is the incestuous relationship that happens in the family first his daughter with his joshua and jana and then his son with his niece two incestuous relationship running in family i am surprised they didn't add the plot of having a mentally disabled in the family now that would really complete the nazi ideal sub human gay lesbian jew br br totally disgusting film i am surprised this film gets no response from any jewish community
<START> this relatively obscure hong kong is the perfect desert island movie for video age peeping at least its first half is every set up every scene every sequence is an excuse to look up a girl's skirt stare down at her breasts gaze at her bottom and leer at her tight crotch what it's establishing is the lead character's perverted proclivities of course br br genre stalwart anthony wong is a marginally perverted married man who is plagued by erotic daydreams and outrageous fantasies all involve scantily clad sexy chinese ladies with nothing but sexual servitude on their minds br br the plot is thickened by a homicidal subplot voodoo doll skewering and a little rape and pillage br br some of the sex scenes are fairly hot and the gore is liberal but the supernatural elements introduced into the second half feel half baked and the plot developments are ludicrous br br clearly producer of garish garbage wong jing was in a terrible hurry to get this into and out of theaters br br the arty title sequence did not fool this jaded punter
