<START> susan slept here turned out to be dick powell's swan song as a performer on the big screen of course he directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until he died it's a pity he didn't go out with his performance in the bad and the beautiful br br frank tashlin has done so many better films i'm still not sure whatever possessed him to do this one the premise is absolutely laughable br br dick powell is a screenwriter who's looking to do more serious stuff than the fluff he's been writing he had an idea for a film on juvenile delinquency so two friendly cops in herb and horace mcmahon deposit 17 year old debbie reynolds on his doorstep she's not a really bad kid and they don't want to put her in the system so they give her to dick powell at christmas time br br i mean is there anyone out there who doesn't see a problem the term comes immediately to mind additionally powell has a girlfriend the young and sexy anne francis why debbie reynolds is any competition here is beyond me br br susan slept here got one oscar nomination the song hold my hand sung by don cornell in the background was nominated for best song but lost to secret love br br powell and reynolds do have some funny moments together and moore as powell's factotum and les tremayne as his lawyer also get a few laughs br br but it's not enough
<START> claudine was one of the very first movies that gave positive role models for both black men and women i appreciated this movie even more as i got older this movie shows that men didn't always turn away from responsibility an excellent movie i'd always recommend for anyone who appreciates a good inner city love story
<START> as a new resolution for this year 2005 i decide to write a comment for each movie i saw in theater 10 or in dvd 90 br br i must admit that dvd have revolutionized this habit for instance i can hear the true voice of the cast which is an essential trait of the personality in my country non french movies are dubbed and we end up with aberrations french voice is terrible very far away of its original tone the same voice for different people or a same people with different voices br br and well if everybody found my comments well in 2006 i will stop my reviews ah ah so enjoy them now br br my summary means that the story locations cast is not very enjoyable br br only br br sandra bullock is there she is a talented actress able to get the viewer to catch on the movie br br it reminds of a feminine the fugitive so if you look for a moment of escaping your life watching this movie makes it worse because sandra's life is a mess br br she got nothing left to hold on to only her poor mother who is ill again the touch for depression br br in fact she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie has a sadder life throughout it to finally get back to it at the end what a happy ending br br maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a nerd's life br br very far away from the best computer movie of all time wargames
<START> native chief's son is wrongfully accused for the death of his father the evil witch doctor orders to execute him he then comes back as a murdering tree well what can you say about such a film if it was intended to be a horror film there obviously was some sort of bad judgment involved and for a comedy it still isn't funny enough i don't know why people make films like this i guess you have to be in a really silly mood to watch it or you might want to see the incredible monstrous tree which gives a new dimension to a slow death or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills by all involved ms or the dialogue and screenplay which were strangely ignored at the academy awards that year br br shouldn't we try psycho analysis on that tree maybe its mother was afraid of oaks 2 10
<START> oh dear oh dear what were they thinking of terrible script terrible acting i don't even feel sorry for the actors they took their cheques to the bank and smiled happily br br since when did an air shaft from charing cross pop out at bank why are vehicles crossing tower bridge going in towards the city when the surge hit why is tower bridge not crowded when the city is being evacuated how does carlyle dive into a raging torrent and survive i could go on and on br br there is no real sense of urgency in the command room they might just as well be waiting for the england eleven to come back onto the pitch after the tea interval at lords br br it says something when i await the to learn more about treatment with eager anticipation br br totally abominable trash
<START> the whole movie was done half assed it could have been a much better movie but that would have required a re write and different actors compared to traffic this was a wreck i am just glad i didn't have to pay for it br br spoiler br br what was the point of having crooked cops getting arrested to share the guilt of drug dealers and make them feel better pu the parents were scum driven by greed and didn't even consider the harm they were doing as pointed out by ice t br br 2 out of 10
<START> warning spoilers br br five young people ignore the warnings of forest ranger george kennedy and hike up to the misty oregon mountains where they are stalked and butchered by a pair of huge deformed in bred hillbilly twins when only two are left warren and his girl connie they resort back to their animal instincts to stay alive the film ends with connie shoving half of her arm down one of the killers' throats choking him to death a very powerful if somewhat overrated backwoods slasher flick thats effective use of lighting sound and photography make it a cut above the usual friday the 13th cash in lead by an attractive likeable cast especially deborah benson where is she now and gregg henry this nifty companion piece to director jeff squirm 1976 and blue sunshine 1977 shouldn't be missed
<START> well i'm not the world's biggest sondheim fan so although i have the cast album and i've listened to it a few times i've never actually seen this show performed and i haven't seen the tim burton movie version either i felt like i wanted to see something more faithful before i see the burton one and give it a chance just as a movie this version isn't a movie at all it's a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast including most importantly angela lansbury's performance as nellie lovett this is one of those performances that's just like a conduit into the heart of the magic of broadway and theater itself she must have had so much fun with this role sweeney todd himself isn't played by len who did it originally but by george does a fantastic job his voice isn't quite as good as but he seems to play it a bit broader br br the only problem i had really was with the johanna character as played by betsy joslyn and to some extent her lover anthony as played by cris voice can't sustain high notes but i wasn't entirely sure if that was maybe supposed to be the point since i'm not hugely familiar with this play more importantly i'm not sure if the story of sweeney todd really holds up enough weight to sustain some of the music but thankfully the whole thing doesn't seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators as a lark and a bit of comedy in the vein of grand guignol it's quite enjoyable i don't feel like it's as significant a piece of work as company and into the woods or some of his other shows some of the music is quite spectacular but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside of the show br br i won't say a whole lot about it here because this is a film website and this is really not a film but just a play that has been shot on film there were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera around but that was it people will want to see this because it preserves lansbury's legendary performance which deserves its legendary status because it's a hilarious and insightful performance george can be proud of his version of sweeney as well this would be a good film to show children over the age of 5 or so to get them interested in musicals because the blood and cannibalism will really surprise them seeing a performance filmed so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater because i prefer shows from the 20s through the 50s to these later era affairs sweeney todd is an exceptional show from its era however miles and miles above the al webber madness
<START> c'mon let's put aside the sophomoric humor that we can find in racism and be honest it isn't funny i was appalled at the fact that the two main stars would agree to do a film that was so offensive and so detrimental to race relations and i'm not referring to the obvious black white commentary in the movie but to the slams towards other ethnicities such as betty white's characterizations of the hispanics should we just chalk up her agreeing to do this movie as a sign of senility is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical trash or is it the fault of the writers how about the third assistant makeup person nope the fault is with us for perpetuating this kind of crap in the guise of comedy that hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough is enough racism is for real and it isn't a laughing matter we're all different let's celebrate that diversity not poke fun at it and promote divisiveness
<START> i am not sure who is having more fun the people that wrote the reviews or the director of the movie i could not go any longer reading this comments or watching this movie i had to say something br br i can see a low budget western film that is done with passion and interest on the detail but using a garage with art deco lettering pastel colors actors that seem to be falling sleep because the script is so boring and the boom getting on the way of the camera every two scenes that is definitely not my definition of one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium br br please if any of you guys had friends in the movie just say it
<START> this is better than the early cronenberg horror films but nothing more than your basic what is real story the videogame theme has been told before too nothing original is left except the weird cronenberg atmosphere which is not that strong here with the amusing sexual references and shore's dark score the story never grabs your full attention it just flows forward event after event with boring pace rating 4 10
<START> i think cheaters needs to be off the air and end the reality show once and for all i don't care what anyone says you can attack me or agree with me but its times like this that the show is just spewing out propaganda and the host of cheaters joey greco is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people on camera is effective and unawares no it just will show disgusting he is also the wiretapping and following of people by cheaters spy's is illegal and a federal offense we are living in a police state like the soviet union and nazi germany rolled into one i am happy that there is poor reviews on this trash this needs to end soon or we are going to lose our liberties as a nation no wonder our country is going to hell its because of this and other filth shows i liked the older shows better from the 1950s 1980s i hope you all agree with me on that thank you
<START> the only reason the duke is tops one of several race movies made during the times of segregation would be worth noting today is because it made the film debut of a 21 year old singer named lena horne she plays ethel andrews a singer who has to leave her producer mentor duke davis ralph cooper in order to branch into the big time davis however has to fake having taken the money for her services in front of her so she won't feel sorry for having done so he then teams up with doc lawrence for a series of medicine shows throughout the south meanwhile in new york her new producers have bombed big time because they made her the whole show instead of simply the specialty act davis finds out from the radio and offers his services as producer and band leader to bring his lineup of other specialty acts many of whom make their one of their few or only film appearances here for his chance at the big time with ethel next to him guess what happens while the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other movie musicals during this time the fact this was made for a certain audience makes this one of the more fascinating features i've seen during this black history month ms horne's singing is on good display here and it's interesting seeing her so young before her professionalism takes full hold later in her career among other supporting players there's an unconfirmed according to imdb appearance by lillian randolph annie in my favorite movie it's a wonderful life and sister of amanda randolph who i just saw in the musical short the black network as the woman with who complains of not being cured after taking the doc's medicine before duke explains it's for the feet and as a longtime louisiana resident i'd like to take note of two players from here in this movie joel from monroe as a tonic customer and marie bryant from new orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax so for just lena horne alone the duke is tops is worth seeing at least once
<START> 'book ii' isn't a film it's a sermon this nauseating sickly and almost unbearably tedious misfire probably works as religious propaganda but has no entertainment value beyond a few wisecracks from george burns plays a little girl who is asked by ahem god to mount an advertising campaign that will get people to believe in him again no really that is the story it's a leaden load of old cobblers that has far too much self justifying religious waffle but barely any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything even approaching magic or charm 'miracle on 34th street' this ain't suzanne pleshette breathes a bit of life into this rancid puddle of quick setting concrete but the pudding headed script and rubbish performance by the irksome quickly send this one down to the fiery depths of you know where
<START> the book the railway children is a children's book published in 1906 by edith an early british socialist who had very strong views about the importance of family values for the upbringing of children and the story it told was presumably intended to be contemporary somewhat surprisingly it seems to retain a significant appeal for today's children a hundred years later br br a film adaptation of an edwardian classic children's story with the principal roles those of the children does not sound very exciting to most film goers in this day and age but a really great performance by jenny agutter who near the start of her long and distinguished acting career played the part of the oldest girl roberta bobby combined with remarkable work by the script writer and director lionel jeffries and outstanding photography by arthur have made this a film that is still not to be missed and one which most of its viewers find quite memorable it is remarkable that this book set in the year 1905 was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000 four of them by the bbc for british television and all of these versions are not only still greatly admired but also very highly regarded something that user comments on this database will confirm even though this may seem almost inconceivable for a nostalgic period story designed to appeal primarily to children since i have not seen the four bbc tv versions these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 film version produced for showing in cinemas unlike most films of children's books 'the railway children' may appeal more to adults than to children the structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children may feel totally lost by the way in which it is depicted in the film whereas many older adults may find it has a considerable nostalgic appeal perhaps compensating for this the children featured in the film are full of life and vitality whilst the adult characters although well rounded tend to mostly be the story is a mature one which deals with love support and encouragement it is not only timeless but capable of appealing to all ages it can fairly be described as sentimental and more than a little idealised but it is never in any way mawkish and that rarely justified adjective fits it like a glove br br spoiler ahead br br the film starts with its upper middle class edwardian family celebrating christmas in a comfortable and fairly spacious london home when two unexpected visitors call and take father who is a senior government officer away with them mother has to move to a very small cottage alongside the railway in a remote part of yorkshire and the children gradually build a new life mainly associated with the railway and the few trains that pass this life proves quite eventful in small ways and the elder daughter bobby grows up rapidly as she takes over more responsibilities from her mother at one point she an accident to the train when her sharp eyes spot that a landslide has created a natural hazard father's story is never given much emphasis but he is never forgotten and it gradually becomes apparent that he is incarcerated and suspected of treason finally these suspicions are cleared up we are not told how or why and he reappears unexpectedly at the local station to rejoin his family br br for many years this film was not available in any home video format in north america but anchor bay created a dvd from it three years ago so they clearly recognised that this quite simple film has not yet lost its appeal for anyone who has not got one already i would very strongly recommend rushing out to buy a copy of this dvd whilst it is still available you would be most unlikely to be disappointed unless you have become totally cynical or your minimum requirements for a film include buckets of blood and or intense sex scenes
