<START> i don't understand the people here the film is neither as good as as bad as some people say here except for de the acting is ok the problem with the film is mainly the script the characters are not believable the sex is done okay but the psychology behind the people makes very little sense the film doesn't look good but what do you expect the film was shot for very little money on video off course then it doesn't look as good as a normal film duh the one thing i do agree on is that the music is bad sounds like a cheap soft erotic film from the '80's the film is not good okay but you have to give some credit for pulling this of without any money
<START> ok this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments but there are a couple of items i wish to add the mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf if we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that fine but the animal in the cage is a coyote that would make a did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote they're easy to tell apart that's weak br br secondly this movie was covered in the third episode of mst3k on the comedy channel it took joel and the bots a number of episodes to get up to full riffing steam and they weren't up there quite yet on this one they did add enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end but it was not one of their better episodes they never even mentioned the glaring omission of an actual wolf and that joke was just hanging in the air waiting to be smacked
<START> just watched this one again i wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time this is why these kind of movies are made to entertain people and zombie bloodbath 2 does that for me and for everyone i have showed it to br br the story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farmhouse when a scarecrow that is actually a demon i think gets disturbed it comes to life and re animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries this leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies br br i loved this movie from it's different formats black and white film video and digital cameras to the very fast pace and great music there was always something going on and it never bores you sure it's cheap but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film i have read other reviews and all i can say is that these people have missed the point if you want 35mm full moon fluff or if you are into modern stuff like urban legend then i say pass on this if you like low budget stuff like gates of hell and evil dead i say buy this now br br the make up and gore is very good the acting is uneven at times but over all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive there is enough going on in this one to fill two more films it is actually one of the better b movies i have seen in ages
<START> this may not be the worst movie to ever win best picture but its up there well on second thought this is probably the worst film to ever win best picture still though you would expect it to be a worth while film that in fact though if questionable as well the film contains almost no depth and is just fun after fun if you want to call it that at first its very interesting but it seems as if everything is exaggerated on so many levels br br the acting was not spectacular to watch but it was quite interesting seeing charlton heston in his first lead role i found many of the characters like the tone of the movie annoying after awhile who i did like a lot was james stewart as the philosophical clown he to me saved the film in that he gave it a much needed extra layer sadly though after stewart there was not much else br br the directing of the much respected cecil demille was non existent to me i found the movie corny at times and his use of betty hutton was a mistake the look of the movie was very good at times but it did not generate that magical feeling that classics need to have the writing was actually pretty good considering how shallow much of the movie was br br from movies like this did the term hollywood trash come up there is no depth no valid attempt at drawing emotions out of the audience and simply no artistic value to the film then of course the many holes in the plot throughout this movie was consistently annoying and frustrating i even had a sense through this film that much of what i was watching was not only and inaccurate depiction of circus life but instead the opposite of how it really is why this won best picture is beyond me but its not like the first or the last time the oscars will and have made a mistake
<START> what a stinker i swear this movie was written by a computer that took a whole pile of other movies and merged them all together into this of film ouch
<START> after seeing the film version of heart of darkness i feel as if i wasted 100 minutes of my life though the book was not my favorite i was very disappointed to see how poorly nicolas roeg portrayed the story despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless the book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie br br you'd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half the differences completely changed the story for me for example when the character of fiancÃ©e is nonchalant to the fact that kurtz has died it completely modifies the ending the book had given not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described it sincerely feels as if roeg was filming another story with references from heart of darkness embedded in it br br if you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like joseph conrad's tale you may find it good though i thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting it is a captivating story all the same however if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story don't look for it in roeg's film
<START> ok let me start off by saying this isn't a horrible movie by any means it's just not good i recall one poster saying the acting isn't campy it's just nuanced no i've seen nuanced japanese and asian acting i'm sorry you're wrong this is camp br br the characters are totally unsympathetic the deaths are totally random and utterly meaningless the writing is bad i'm fine with suspending disbelief i'm fine with not having everything handed to me in terms of plot but this movie has no plot one reviewer stated this movie is set in a small town where people are going nuts over and spirals that's not a blurb that's the entire freaking film congratulations i've just saved you nearly an hour and a half there is nothing more to it no character development no plot development no explanations no resolution and not even the acceptable within the realm of j horror lack of resolution just nothing br br in addition the musical score is done by someone who obviously wasn't actually watching the movie at the time because it's random enough to cause whiplash cognitive dissonance is one thing and done well it can be brilliant see dark water but here it just seems as if the score was designed to go with another movie all together br br the best example i can give is it's as if the japanese remade evil dead without any of the clever bits or good acting it just falls flat it's j horror without the horror
<START> the most vivid portrait of small town oddity i've seen in a long time and i'm not just talking about australian films this piece of work seems to have been made under the radar and really it's an entirely fascinating piece of work that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent film making br br at times it is rather slow and strange it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it's a thriller or a 'head movie' but the stunning aspect of the film by alex is its iron fisted ruthless direction it never wavers it is highly controlled precise and absolutely self assured the cinematography is some of the most artful beautiful and lyrical i've seen the sound is all psychological the music builds the tension br br by the third act the story is ramped up and episodes collide and converge don't attempt to piece together the puzzle of the last 20 minutes it's a bit of an but by that time the film has you a bit of a trance a sort of hypnosis and you've been sold a riddle that has no real answer
<START> i first saw this movie back in 1994 or '95 during my freshman year in high school when it was on lifetime after i first saw it i thought it was wonderful sure it may not have run longer but it is as accurate as can be in my own opinion regardless of what anyone else may think cynthia was great at portraying karen and mitchell anderson was okay as richard louise fletcher yes who played nurse in 1975's one flew over the cuckoo's nest was fine as well but i found her version of agnes karen and richard's mother to be a little bit of a control freak i am an extremely huge fan of the carpenters and i believe that karen's voice was and still is so wonderful it really saddens me about the fact that she is gone and had left this earth too soon but thanks to the never ending popularity of her music and her angelic voice the music will live on anyway back on track to this movie it really is a mystery to me and possibly other people fans and non fans of the carpenters as to what caused karen to end up getting this problem with her health was it the media that was responsible or was it just karen's decision i would not believe that it was her decision it could have been the media from one article that was printed out about her somewhere in '70 when their hit close to you came out from what was shown in the film there are some other moments in the movie as well richard's struggle with drugs and karen's brief marriage i did not hear about her loss in february of 1983 as i was not yet into watching the news i had found out years later i don't know if there will be another movie about the carpenters or karen made in the future but until then this movie will do fine i will say this though if karen had disregarded the false details of that article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content calling her chubby which must have been quite an insult she would still be here on this earth today i know that she is in heaven and probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice god bless you karen
<START> this movie easily falls into the category of laughable if not beyond that to actually insulting i mean in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play from beginning to end we bombarded with overacting and ridiculous facial expressions laying on the im a loose cannon act a little thick another picking point i had with the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character i mean in one scene where lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of then lewis begins to play his rendition of a whole lot of shaking' and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world these kind of scenes of which there are numerous coupled with the lack of depth in any of the characters led me to actual laughter so all in all this film is not worth viewing for anyone not interested in mocking a filmmaker and his actors decisions for an hour and a half
<START> nurse betty is the kind of movie you can't describe on a poster or in a trailer or commericial it's the kind of movie that you walk in to expecting a more mature dumb and dumber what with temporarily insane waitress goes on a cross country adventure while avoiding crooks trying to kill her br br the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams the best part about nurse betty is it's unpredictability director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next
<START> this movie is truly a classic 80s movie a must have in any movie collection guns bad guys creeps gangs charles bronson and more creeps br br in my opinion this is the best death wish movie tons of non stop action br br and keeping with the classic 80's bad guy vs good guy movie this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and creeps we see bronson mowing down thugs and creeps with a 30 caliber korean war heavy machine gun a heavy machine gun for crying out loud when charlie runs out of ammo for the heavy machine gun he runs back to his crib and takes up arms with his long range high caliber pistol this pistol can stop a freakin elephant and charlie is putting holes the size of hub caps into bad guys with it and if that is not enough charlie is also packing an anti tank grenade launcher which by the way is only good if he can get the creeps clumped together br br the acting in this movie is ha ha great and a lot of off the wall actors mainly playing creeps appear throughout the movie the film is loaded with memorable one liners and scenes heck my favorite scene line is where the creep leader confronts broson in jail and calmly explains to him tell you what i am going to do i'm gonna kill a little old lady just for you catch it on the six o'clock news br br is this film violent heck yes but you'll laugh and cringe all the way through
<START> being a history buff i rented this movie because of the subject matter the idea of the ellis island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is intriguing unfortunately the movie falls flat much of the story is simply boring nothing much happens for long stretches the director uses goofy imagery offered up in the form of daydream sequences in an apparent attempt to break up the glacial pacing but instead it clashes with the authentic look and feel of the movie the characters are also poorly drawn in the end we don't really care as much about them as we should it's a shame that this wasn't what it could have been i would still like to see a good movie about the american immigrant experience but this one isn't it
<START> forget the recent dire american remake which sadly tarnished the reputation of the french original by virtue of the director's involvement in both this is a deftly drawn romantic 90s noir with many twists and turns it works best as a gallic ode to hitchcock's rear window because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that fires the intricate screenplay the story is stunningly realized like a picasso painting offering multi perspectives on the same event and demanding the viewer's participation throughout the settings music and haunting score are wonderful as well as the excellent contributions from the cast watch it more than once
<START> for me this is another one of those films that i got to see off of the los angeles based z channel when it was in service and it was another one of those movies that i saw when i was young and learned that there was a world out there one i did not want to accept br br moving to los angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date no premiere channel programming has matched the z channel in its showing of international films the three international films that stuck in my young head were spetters beau pere and of course this one pixote br br this was the most shocking and saddest movie i ever witnessed in my life this was also one of the first movies that made me understand that there is a difference in cinema to entertain and to inform let me be honest growing up in a small town on the east coast i had no idea anything like this to this extent existed all i knew from south america was brochures of fabulous vacations and that columbia had a lot of drug trafficking br br then comes a film like pixote sad disturbing unflinching scary you're watching children those that need shelter love understanding and all these get are a way to survive day after day through drugs sex robbing stealing sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes etc their survival is hard to watch with other street children prostitutes etc and you begin to wonder how can things like this be allowed to happen in this world br br pixote is not a film for entertainment it is a film of information it shows shocking and disturbing images but it shows life for these daily street children
