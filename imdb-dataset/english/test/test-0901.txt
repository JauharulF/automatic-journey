<START> 8 points for take on probably what really kinda maybe more what it was like back then american indians probably stole more than killed who really knows nice slower odd pursuit means it has a pace and interesting and unique thankfully not another mindless shoot em up i thought this would suck at first i wound up getting wrapped up nice treasure good job i have hopes nobody dissects this film when the entire movie unfolds you have many unique twists impossible to determine what will be next the characters are human and have either honor or not passion or not forgiveness or not wound up loving the white horse the indian sheen even the damned desert all good
<START> interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding jay leno's replacing carson as host of the tonight show film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding conan o'brien and jay leno br br the film does a good job of sparking viewers' interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the particularly of the nbc executives the portrayal of was particularly compelling and interesting i thought br br still many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon and some of the acting seemed perfunctory nevertheless an interesting story
<START> the murder of the red in abbey was a long way from one of the most horrendous things ever done in the scottish war of independence and fights and killing in churches wasn't unusual at all not that much later robert wife daughter two of his sisters were captured during a fight in a church in which people were killed and comparing it to the massacre of berwick in which the english slaughtered at least 8000 non combatants some yes in churches is ridiculous br br that said this is not a well made movie it is slightly antidote to the absolutely ridiculous sniveling representation of robert bruce in braveheart whatever bruce was it wasn't a wuss br br too bad that they didn't do a better job of this because someone should make a really good movie of a war that is so amazing that it sounds like something someone made up going from complete defeat at the battle of to a secret return from hiding to a long guerrilla war to this isn't it though poorly made and to a large extent poorly written and acted too bad
<START> i like the film itÂ´s the best pirate movie i watched hitherto forget silly errol flynn stuff and pirates of the caribbean this movie is wonderful melancholic i compare it with johnny guitar at the sea side but 3 years earlier two women fighting for a man where mad love might lead one br br the character of the female anti heroine anne providence is superb acting without compromise like a child lost alone on her search for a own female identity in a real world sheÂ´s a quite strange movie hero not a funny pirate as most of her companions in this genre not making jokes all the time fighting for the poor and good and only killing the stupid spanish or british soldiers or better sly governors but sheÂ´s murdering all the poor prisoners of war after she captured a ship look careful at this at the start of the movie sheÂ´s primitive she canÂ´t even read she is and she an alcoholic she looses all her friends as consequence of her obstinacy and sheÂ´s wearing rags most of the film this film shows a pirate hero a little bit as he or in this case she but there has been a female anne buccaneer anne might have been in brutal reality br br the film is quite short and the story is told in a breathtaking manner certainly a film from the 1950s has no exciting special effects for present time viewers the ships swim very obvious in a bath tube but this real drama about love that kills trust betrayal revenge hatred and sacrifice drives one crazy maybe anne is even supposed to be judas and jesus from nazareth in one person being betrayed by her friend the french as jesus after being disappointed by the friend delivering him to a death penalty as judas than getting remorse about this like judas who commits suicide according to the gospel of matthew and in the end sacrificing herself for the rescue of the beloved enemy as jesus but even if you are not interested in this philosophical questions of guilt and atonement the film brings a lot of cheap action as sword fights and burning plastic ships for a very short one and a half hour
<START> i kind of like bam so i was curious br br but watching a home production with somebody elses friends and family with a decent camera and a sound guy just isn't good film making br br writing direction acting and editing is abysmal at best but i sat through half of it and why br br this film gives perfect examples of what not to do it is a film student's dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process cram it into film school all over the joint br br so thanx bam now i know jackass is for real cause you ain't looking to win an oscar dude
<START> i watched this out of curiosity i enjoyed stargate sg1 and i've watched many of the other tv shows and movies that the principal characters have worked on br br my expectations weren't high so i was surprised to be so monstrously disappointed br br the acting throughout is appalling and the script is worse br br zero research into the bad science that is spouted throughout the movie or into martial arts which several cast members engage in throughout the movie despite clearly having no martial arts training baton twirling does not a warrior make training makes the already implausible plot even less credible the same weapon carried by michael shanks when shot at the side of a mountain causes extreme damage but when shot indoors at the wall made of wicker creates a small fireworks effect without damaging the wicker structure ok i suppose michael shanks fans will be sued to seeing that in stargate sg1 where a staff weapon creates either a surface burn on a main character or blasts a hole in a section of castle wall as required but still a bad cgi snake 'god' eats one of the faithful in the way a dog would eat snakes just don't behave like that br br the basic premise of an amazonian warrior cult on a distant planet is silly at best matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are required in the process of propagating the species for instance the who didn't figure out the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century at which time the balance of power moved from the women to the men they carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science particularly of medicine so the idea that a matriarchal society could exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based purely on the original author's wet dream of course the few references to stellar science made in this movie demonstrate that the author knew nothing about that either except for a few keywords that he must have heard in other movies still it could have been done better like in 1965 for instance which showed matriarchal society with a certain reverence far more believably and even after 45 years it seems fresher than this fetid exercise in stupidity marching a few women around in pouting aggressively and spitting out their lines like a kiddie looking for a fight in a nightclub come on then i'll do ya style seems to be over simplifying the complexities of a matriarchal culture br br the cultural references are so simple 'all hail the snake mother' pretty much sums it all up even the tiniest hamlet shows more cultural variation br br there is nothing clever thought provoking interesting visually exciting or remotely entertaining about this movie the soundtrack is of similar quality br br i can only assume that the few overly charitable positive reviews this movie has received are from blinkered michael shanks fans who will give a thumbs up to anything he's involved in don't be fooled low budgets are not a reason for a film to fail cheap b movies can be brilliant this isn't one of them and there's no reason to inflict this movie on yourself
<START> fans of euro horror flicks video dvd store movie madness has a whole section devoted to this genre can't afford to miss sergio martino's gut busting l'isola degli uomini pesce called in the united states here's the lowdown some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted caribbean island in the island is inhabited by a landowner a scientist joseph cotten and his daughter barbara bach sure enough it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish men and while the fish men remain calm as long as they can drink their potion they get nasty otherwise br br this movie is sort of a mixture of genres euro horror swashbuckling voodoo and maybe a little bit of the island of dr moreau but it's mostly an excuse to have the fish men disembowel trespassers ya gotta love that i wouldn't be surprised if the euro horror genre gave quentin tarantino some of his ideas for grindhouse after all the european horror directors have no scruples about what they show this is one that you're sure to like br br so joseph cotten is the only cast member from an alfred hitchcock movie i mean shadow of a doubt who later co starred with ringo starr's soon to be wife and audrey hepburn's ex by whom i mean mel ferrer in an italian horror flick the things that we see in life
<START> a lot of people are flaming this film for the presence of paris hilton but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie the reality is that paris has a fairly minimal part she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen the film also makes fun of her on several occasions usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision for those who enjoy paris stage presence this may be a movie to see at home when its released on video because at the screening i was at we all laughed at her misfortunes through the movie and she is portrayed as a woman of questionable values br br the movie itself was pretty good unlike the recent flood of weak horror flicks it has everything a good horror should a creepy villain excessive violence acts which make that average person cringe this movie hit all the bases it is definitely worth a watch
<START> there are a limited number of fans for movies in the world that would love a particular genre to go to the depths that this crew has done to bring to life something that the very writer of the original film had up to this point never achieved this is a wonderful exploration of the real dedication and love it takes to reach towards a potentially very successful cult film br br originally with the blessings from alex cox this crew began producing the sequel of one of his movies in absolute true punk fashion their goal simply being to fully capture the atmosphere as it should be for a complete tribute to the original repo man film br br this is a great tale of dedication and the treachery that can occur along the path to wonderful movie making a truly entertaining tale and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer
<START> low budget mystery a shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction a young architect jimmy mcmillan chick chandler discovers a dead body that goes missing the woman in a hurry mary june clyde is linked to the death scene but it is mcmillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene all the atmosphere of film noir but not quite the real thing this flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery drama and is a nice little escape other players include george meeker michael milton wallace and rebel randall
<START> even though i saw this film when i was very young i already knew the story of wild the thief taker and shepherd who famously escaped from newgate prison br br apart from the liberty taken right at the end the film more or less faithfully follows the true story the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that br br of the performances there is scarcely a poor performance and tommy steele is ideally cast also good is stanley baker as the thief taker and alan is good as always br br because the film sticks to the facts it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family
<START> red dust is both well acted and well made but what the movie is about i think will bore many viewers as it did to me there was a film that was out earlier called in my country with sam jackson and it was not that well received and both films were about nearly the same exact thing i do think red dust was better because of the more interesting performances especially by future oscar winner but the plot is just to lacking it starts off pretty strong but then the film hits the viewers with countless un interesting court room sessions this could have been a great film if the writing was not so lacking but see if for the performances
<START> first i have to say that i really love udo kier and have always had respect for armand assante but nothing could save this train wreck of a movie udo does not even appear till much later in the movie and the acting from everyone is just terrible the script is all over the place the dialog is wooden the action is laughable and the plot could be summed up on a dirty cocktail napkin i really wanted to find something redeeming in this movie but found myself holding my hands over my eyes shaking my head and repeating over and over to myself oh udo why why if you are a fan of udo or armand please don't watch this movie it will only make you sad for them
<START> this movie was disappointing for at least one of two reasons the suspense created disappeared because of horrible acting or lack of direction from the director i don't know it was like a tasty bubble gum that seemed to run out of flavor yet you continue to chew on it because it once tasted great like most thrillers the hitchhiker had promise yet failed to deliver when it had me bright eyed and ready to turn the volume down i was watching the movie alone in the dark this so called thriller simply came apart like it was made of lego transforming into something else it simply ran out of gas and left me staring at a made for tv like style movie with one exception it was probably rated r
<START> my only problem with the curse of the were rabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce wallace and gromit to those not familiar with park's short films strangely a close shave manages to do this with a lot less time to spare still i loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters human and otherwise i especially loved ralph fiennes voice as the scheming victor quartermaine it is also interesting to see the series on the large screen the workmanship with the clay characters really stands out it's a hoot and great for the whole family i buy very few dvds but i have every wallace and gromit and will happily add this one
