<START> sigh i'm baffled when i see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration the set design seen many times before the whole weak tim burton ish style and the story that goes nowhere and we got the joke about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time alright br br but i guess what's really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called lenore the cute little dead girl by roman dirge as any quick internet search will reveal i mean what is this this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker give your head a shake as don cherry might say
<START> this movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town i now have many friends who are guards at dixon correctional and i myself worked for 3 yrs at the store next to the store the old lady was at however this is still the dumbest movie ever made destined to be introduced by gilbert or rhonda shearer if it hasn't been already a bit of trivia illinois doesn't even have parole hearings and dixon prison is a medium security facility housing burglars and vending machine vandals the classic clucking seduction scene is perhaps the most amusing piece of writing i've ever seen especially with the suspenseful build up
<START> why is guy working for buddy probably because ari was not around in 1995 why does dawn want to be with guy for access to buddy why does she stay with guy i am not sure br br there are bunch of things about this movie that i am not sure about but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â and totally believable because he is a great actor br br frank guy is certainly out of his element working for buddy Â he wants to write and make meaningful movies not be a gofer that is verbally abused for getting equal instead of sweet low br br michelle dawn who also wants to make meaningful movies seems way out of guy's league br br the ending leaves a lot to be desired
<START> a big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film incredibly bad very pretentious it would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute br br we don't really learn anything about this character except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic we don't know why nicholas cage turns in an excellent performance as usual but i feel that this role and this script let him down and how after not being able to perform for the whole film can he have an erection on his deathbed really terrible and i felt like i needed a bath
<START> debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l a punk explosion of the early eighties it's all there not just great great bands like black flag fear x the germs whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over estimated but also the promoters the media and first of all the audiences the punks all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy the anger and the fury these youths put into their music where is that today the eighties may have sucked big time when it to mainstream music but the underground was rocking if you need a proof for that watch performance in decline unmatched great film how come this is not available on vid ld or dvd p s the follow up decline pt ii is hilarious too
<START> horrible movie this movie beat out revenge of the living zombies for the worst movie i have ever suffered through what the were the morons who made this film thinking was it supposed to be scary because man let me tall you it wasn't it was so dumb it wasn't funny we all know that tropical islands are the natural hunting grounds for killer snowmen and those stupid baby snowballs stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid fake snow and lousy actors oh and frost looks nothing like he does on the box do not waste your time rent it and destroy it
<START> lonely disconnected middle class housewife in the midst of a divorce seeks solace to reflect on her immediate future at some sort of bed and breakfast by well literally in the sea the ocean that for some sort of odd reason she subs for the owner enter lonely arrogant richard gere he is a plastic surgeon he is the only guest at the inn in the sea diane lane is the lonely housewife you'll never guess these two fall immediately in love a tropical storm makes them true lovers br br the subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense the locations photography are fine gere remains one of the most over rated actors in cinema and does not disappoint ms lane must've needed the money but phones in her part with grace
<START> the 1970's saw a rise and fall of what we have come to know as blacksploitation films the term is a reference to kind of broad catch all rather than a true genre of film in short any comedy drama adventure western or urban cops robbers shoot em up that are so constructed and so cast as to appeal to the large urban black population of the mid 20th century that indeed could embrace the widest type of films as long as the had a slant toward the inner city black population br br it appears that the idea of producing these films of particularly keen interest to black americans had its genesis with the release of 100 rifles marvin schwartz prod 20th century fox 1969 in it former university all american footballer and several times all pro for the cleveland browns jim brown had a co starring billing having appeared in a number of films already as for example rio 1964 the dirty dozen 1967 ice zebra 1968 and others it was beginning to make more sense to the studios' suits that jim was a hot property br br now this 100 rifles brings record numbers of black patrons to the big cities' central business districts on easter sunday to view mr brown why not start to film more of these adventure epics and other types of film with more black players and stars why not indeed so we saw a succession of cops robbers bad ass private detective films comedies all going the route along the way we eventually got to some more family oriented wider appealing films the movie goers were treated to 1972 the take 1974 1974 and ultimately claudine 1974 br br in claudine we find no stigma nor easy classification as being blackploitation as the story is universal and could easily have been done as a story about people of any descent any where and not just in the 1970's usa br br that the story was done of a single mother claudine dianne carroll struggling to keep a family together after two marriages and two almost marriages is a far cry from a shoot em up harlem style the problems that plague the everyday citizens of our nation are confronted and examined under the ol' sociological microscope br br but we also consider psychological and physical needs as a female for woman needs man and man must have his mate and we do concede this point that's s e x that we're talking about schultz claudine meets up with a very masculine broad shouldered athletic type in private garbage man ruppert b marshall james earl jones and they go on a date br br the great welfare state intervenes with the couple as welfare case worker miss tayback elisa comes snooping around to see just who is this unattached male who is suddenly paying so much attention to family br br after a humiliating experience with the welfare bureau's and binge which would be the norm for the family the two decide to get married with or without the blessing of big brother br br meanwhile elder son has gotten involved with some big talking but little doing black activist group but with help he and they all come through it a o k br br it ends on a happy upbeat and hopeful note we know that it may not be exactly happily ever after but rather make it all together if there is a single criticism that we must state it is that sometimes in a movie like this a misconception is spread to a large portion of urban blacks and that is the apparent implied myth that all whites are wealthy having none of their kind ever in need of a helping hand out of work or suffering any disabilities br br well folks it just ain't true note at one point jim brown's career was a real hit as a rugged actioner he was even being tauted as the black john wayne note the idea of producing films with all black casts filmed for all black consumption was not a new idea in the 1920's '30's and '40's we saw productions from people like noble johnson spencer williams jr and rex ingram br br note that's as time goes by you know schultz it's from casablanca warner brothers 1942
<START> i thought besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them capture true human emotions the main character's struggles triumphs set backs hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all the film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical sci fi labeling and become a true drama however calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post apocalyptic plot true this type of movie has been done been before but i think this one captures the joys and sorrows of that type of world possibly better than any other one does
<START> i sat uncomfortably through this film becoming more and more staggered at just how it got made at all the script itself makes the acting look embarrassing and it fundamentally becomes a waste of time for everybody concerned if you avoid seeing one film this year make it this one
<START> hardware wars rips off everything in star wars but if you are planning on doing any parody you need to do it just a bit better than this not that there is anything wrong per se with hardware wars but if you spoof do it well or not at all
<START> this film is an attempt to appeal to a younger demographic of fourteen to 24 yr and an insult to all of them i refuse to believe that that age group is that vapid as to be entertained by this unnecessary remake early in the film one of the characters proclaims i am surrounded by idiots this is the defining moment in the film which goes steadily down from there full of clichÃ©s red herring scares and unexplained events the film is also full of characters who are not exactly brainiacs a formula all too familiar in dumb horror movies and that crappy it's so dark i cant see scenes stolen from chainsaw massacre but merely annoying not building any tension nor horror it's difficult to film in the dark and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a film that's suppose to have tension but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case the better maybe he didn't want to wait until morning because he didn't care other than it might cost him more money to do night scenes well or he doesn't know how who knows unless you have never seen a horror film in your life or you are two or three years old every aspect of this film is predictable and done before warning paris hilton is in this movie enough said all in all a blasÃ© slasher film which begs the question where the h ll is the wax it was treated like a lost leader if you're bored as possible and all other rentals are out or you're just in the mood for a bad horror film which isn't really scary or you'd like to see paris have a pole smash through her head go ahead and take a chance it's not the worst movie i've ever seen but if this is what the producers of this film thinks a younger audience wants i pray that they are deluded a profit driven film with no attempt to achieve any kind of art nor respect for the genre you know smart characters make for a scarier movie i believe this is debut as a director besides commercials and music videos he has another one coming out in 2006 called goal 2 hopefully his goal is to make a better film
<START> an awful film badly written badly acted cliched hackneyed dross the premise is such a good one and a chance to educate about black cowboys but the film is truly dire it is a curious mix of a bad 1950's randolph scott b movie and a bad 1970's spaghetti western the villains are cardboard the flashbacks laughable the dialogue excruciating br br the deliberate anachronisms such as rap singers and modern swear words like motherf er are irritating to the extreme br br a frankenstein monster that died on the lab table
<START> you know people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous well not this time unconditional love has it all barry manilow and a dwarf in a movie with cathy bates as the romantic lead and it works not only does it work it works very very well in fact i think it's perfect i laughed so hard i think i hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human so honest and so very real but isn't that where great comedies come from don't characters need real feelings real emotions and the ability to feel real pain well they do in this movie unconditional love is a movie you shouldn't miss especially if you need a seriously good laugh or you're at all curious about seeing the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat
<START> what is it about the french first they apparently like jerry lewis a lot more than the us does second they seem to like edgar allan poe's work more than just about anyone else does it's got to be the effect br br don't get me wrong i'm a poe fan myself but this trilogy manages to make three of poe's below average stories into well i'm not sure what they're made into br br toby dammit is a fine fellini film but it has nothing to do with poe's story at least in terms of theme it's enjoyable on the first viewing terence stamp does a good job with an interesting role however it has nothing whatsoever to do with poe or spirits of the dead br br is a big mess how did vadim's films get produced it's just awful not even up to amateur film school standards depending on the dvd menu you have try to skip it and save your time br br william wilson is actually the segment that is most faithful to poe's work it does not have much style though even if it includes the strangest snowball fight i think that i have ever seen on film it looks like the boys are throwing tissues or maybe handkerchiefs that have been rolled up into balls br br my advice is to skip watch william wilson and then if you're a fellini fan i'm not keep toby dammit on while you cook dinner or make a snack
