<START> it's astonishing that some people saw this as art we saw it as a poorly filmed shaky hand held camera and all generally badly acted unscripted mess that seemed more like a high school film project with the kids experimenting in black white film making injecting mounds of poetry in place of a story does not an art film make when we watched this in the theatre people were starting to have fits of the giggles us included at the endless stupidity of this self indulgent meandering mess and believe me it does seem endless had we finished our candy and popcorn we too would have walked out of the theatre with the other two dozen people who packed up and left looking for something more interesting to do
<START> i'll start blasting the movie first remove abbott and costello from the cast and you've got a badly colored movie stiff cardboard from the casting department badly dubbed sound especially during the singing and annoying dialog ex listen to the line mr ad infinitum obviously some studio hack thought that they could cash in on disney's classic presentation of mickey and the but maybe audiences were either more gullible back then improbable or stuck in a double feature more probable even children should feel insulted at having this movie shown to them a total waste of celluloid now about the acting of abbott and costello bud abbott always played the straight man and by all accounts was the nicer person off the set on radio his character was usually the smooth fast talker and was especially funny when his speed caused him to flub his lines and smooth over the mistakes in the movies he still plays the straight man but is more of a con artist not that he's bad at it but that character has been played to perfection by groucho marx the real travesty of the duo on film is lou costello again on radio he was funny he played a character that was a little slower than abbott but not too much slower he was also glib with the lines and got me laughing when he would ad lib at abbott's mistakes on film i don't know if it was his decision or not but in the movies his character becomes a shoddy impersonation of stan laurel which in turn was even more shoddily done by jerry lewis why the change he was funny on radio when he was a but here he becomes a child like character that looks like he's mugging for the cameras in every shot this characterization is shown in every movie they do and only brings a stain to the reputation they had on radio what is left to their film career is a poor very very poor copy of laurel and hardy the movies would have been much funnier if they had played their radio characters instead of retreads of stock casting
<START> this is the most stupid movie ever made the story is laughable his wife and kid think he's insane then they don't then it turns out he is and i think they knew it all along there is a dog named ned that causes some problems and i think it's all his fault so does jim carey god only knows why virginia madsen took this role this is a career sinker i think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 year olds and that adds up to 23 or maybe it's for 8 and 10 years olds which also adds up to 23 or maybe it's for really dumb 23 year olds or maybe really dumb 32 year olds because that's 23 in reverse or maybe 46 year olds would enjoy it because half of that is 23 i think looking up things on the internet about the number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie unless you wanted to see a comedy
<START> this particular film was one that i wanted to see in theaters but never got around to it when i finally rented it in the summer of 2001 i enjoyed it so much that i went out and bought the dvd soon after bonnie hunt and don lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the dvd they did a great job in creating characters that you really care about i really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness anxiety and joy the film also does a great job in showing the importance of family a rarity in film today which is a reflection of the director bonnie hunt based on the comments she made on the dvd david duchovny showed me here that there is life beyond fox mulder giving a wonderful performance with some pretty poignant scenes i highly recommend that you give this movie a viewing i am really thankful to the creators of this film they have given me a wonderful piece of cinematic viewing that i will recommend to all my friends i have seen a lot of movies over the years and it is very rare that i come away with such a feeling of satisfaction after watching a film i will watch this time and time again for years to come return to me reminds me that there are still moviemakers out there that know how to sincerely please their movie audiences thanks
<START> probably will contain spoilers br br after a successful attempt to get attention i would not call making sure that you get help before you die a failed suicide attempt joey finds out that she is pregnant and starts seeing images of spirits br br overall the movie was a little slow going but entertaining enough to watch the whole thing for a horror movie there were only a few minor creeps and thrills halfway through however was a really good scary scene i wont give it away though i watched this movie because i really liked the preceding movie the eye br br i was a little confused however to determine that other than being a supernatural suspense movie from the same creators the eye 2 had no relation to the eye whatsoever different cast different story the does not even have anything to do with eyes br br the movie had a few questionable scenes joey attempts suicide 3 times 4 times if you count the time when witnesses say they saw joey trying to jump in front of the train she is associated with brutally defacing an attacker she freaks out in a restaurant and witnesses say she was attacking people and yet she is allowed to go about her business freely without even so much as a psyche evaluation or put in the hospital for reasons other than her pregnancy br br the movie was not the greatest horror movie the story was rather far fetched even for a fiction movie p the spooks were either few and or nothing we have not seen before however it was an interesting story and once you know what the truth is behind the spooks it was an interesting twist on the ghost story br br i rate the movie 3 out of 10
<START> for those who are like me and are used to watch and enjoy high budget hollywood films on huge screens with a surround audio this film seems to be so distant however it surprised me how close can it be to any human while i watch it it is so natural that you feel like nobody wrote a scenario or nobody directed it you are the director and you are writing the scenario while you watch it for me the time i spend on watching a film is the only time which i go to another world this film is the first sample for me which shows that it is not always a must to watch millions of dollars of budgeted films surround audio capabilities to go to another world this films sends you to another world or maybe makes you return back to yourself without millions of dollars of budget or technical capabilities i felt like that i'm reading from camus
<START> there are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box office failures an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that for once an indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience and not churned out a kader khan type stereo typical hoax the movie is about two guys who dream of riches and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter a humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story the complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot aamir khan plays the a street smart guy while salman khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy the villian played by paresh rawal and his henchmen junior and make you laugh in your sleep although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies despite shoddy camerawork and despite being loud at times it remains one of the scarce funny movies bombay has come up with after movies like and other movies it is sad that it didn't do well at the box office for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned
<START> a scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrong the creators become trapped in a remote desert outpost pursued relentlessly and mercilessly by their own creation james stockton the scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monster is called the outpost to help undo the horror that now lurks somewhere within the dark halls james together with his son and daughter soon find themselves trapped inside with the others trying desperately to survive and with the outpost sealed from within there is no way out the outpost mind ripper is highly unoriginal the sets are pretty claustrophobic and there's a bit of gore however as a horror it fails miserably on almost all levels there's zero suspense the script is weak and filled with big holes and the ending is extremely predictable so called master wes craven produced this one i wonder if he is happy with this trash joe directs without any style the acting is horrible only lance henriksen can act at all ok i'm a big horror fan and was bitterly disappointed avoid it like the plague it's just the same old boring crap again
<START> this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and i stopped caring this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports br br sounds promising br br not really br br i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film basically i started not watching which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up br br it may work for you it didn't for me
<START> macbeth i've always thought is the most accessible of shakespeare's 'great plays compact focused with heaps of violence it should have been the play most open to screen adaptations i'm not aware of a really good rendering of the story however the best effort being orson welles's vigorous shoestring version to the list of we must add the connery effort br br it seems it was not a 'film at all but a tv version that was given a theatrical release post romeo juliet and branagh's hamlet that might explain some of its flaws but doesn't excuse them br br it starts well with a feisty battle sequence with pleasingly grisly witches looking on poor old gray and are cut from the opening scene but they aren't alone for long in quick order they are joined by the bloodied sargent and his account of the battle the treachery of the of the luckless master o' the tiger even macbeth's meeting with duncan when he is invested as of all of these had virtues that plead like angels trumpet tongued against the dark damnation of their sending off but sent off they are these aren't the only cuts either this is macbeth in a hurry br br from the opening battle we are pitched directly into macbeth's encounter with the witches which is well done brian blessed curiously directed the witchy sequences and he has great fun with the special effects as macbeth and banquo are told of their fates jason connery as macbeth is awkward obviously unsure what to make of the verse graham as banquo on the other hand is capable making his lines natural and easy within a few minutes of connery's mumbling the viewer is struck the urge to see the roles reversed and in the title role no wonder macbeth felt he needed to kill him br br these first few minutes marks the high point of the film from there we move to helen receiving word of her husband she's as lost as connery and denied the beard that he gets to hide behind her unsex me here of evil is embarrassing not unsettling there are some reasonably clever touches macbeth's we will speak further is not a sign of his hesitancy in the face of his wife's wicked ambition but his attempt to silence her prattling as he throws her onto the bed br br the acting of the leads is the biggest let down connery's method consists of staring about the screen while he mumbles his monologues via voice over looks pinched and neurotic an attempt to do something interesting with is this a dagger the fantastical dagger is a shadow cast by a cross on an altar falls flat due to connery's poor delivery and sloppy direction which mars the production throughout we accompany lady macbeth back into the murder chamber where she gets to stab the reviving duncan but the effect is comic not dramatic br br big scenes are botched the appearance of banquo at the feast is made incomprehensible through attempts to mix subjective rendering of macbeth's delusion with what those around him see or don't see the second meeting with the witches is even less coherent and the prophetic visions are confusing timing seems to be an issue here banquet is the of the play but the film moves rapidly towards conclusion after it giving it an unbalanced feel and no scope for the intricacies of the riddles macbeth is caught in to be appreciated or for his descent into madness to be convincing another crucial cut is the scene where malcolm tests and learns of the murder of his family this robs his revenge of most of its emotional force and the character of a lot of the screen time he's a virtual stranger when he turns up to kill macbeth br br a point for trying banquo earns another the first few minutes garners another but that's all from then on it's sound and fury blah blah blah
<START> i can honestly say that death bed the bed that eats was a much better movie than i expected allow me to clarify the plot in case the title of the film is a little too vague there is a bed that eats an evil bed it eats people several unsuspecting women on an outing of some kind stumble across the sinister sack and ultimately fall prey to it's hunger the devouring process consists of a yellow foam soaking people into it's inner stomach acid all complete with chewing sounds this is a very strange cult flick and the only film from george barry who had forgotten he made it until word of mouth of it's newfound cult status got back to him and he decided to release it on dvd not a bad movie at all if you can look past the lousy acting and enjoy the hokey effects the most laughable being the guy whose hands are eaten off and he is left with only plastic looking skeletal fingers pretty dreamlike tone to it too coming across as very surreal and aberrant mainly the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed if you like bizarre no budget oddball flicks than definitely seek out death bed
<START> two sisters su mi im soo jung and su yeon moon young return home with their father kim gap soo jeong ah welcomes them but su manner is bitter to her su mi hates because the father let her act like the house wife after the sisters' mother died seeing her attitude is getting to treat the sisters coldly and there grows a tense atmosphere among them br br as if called in by the atmosphere series of mysterious things occur in the house when su mi is hanging her dress in her wardrobe there have been already hung a lot of dresses of the same design when she put her diary into a drawer she finds another diary of the same kind there when she is sleeping in her bed with scared su yeon a nightmare awakes her and she finds a woman standing on her and a hand dangles out of the woman's skirt br br mysterious things occur to the other people too on the evening of next weekend brother and his wife visit the family and they have a dinner together cheerfully talks about a crazy man she met when she was a child but nobody is interested in her talk she says the crazy man annoyed the brother but he says he doesn't know anything about the man br br listening to their talk the brother's wife has a panic br br after the dinner the conflict between and the sisters becomes at its worst pulls su yeon into a wardrobe and locks her in it su mi saves the crying out sister and complains to their father what has done to his daughter but his response is unexpected give me a break says he angrily su mi please don't make me tired any more br br and the following words out of the father's mouth are more shocking than what they have seen in the house br br to tell the truth i hate horror movies although i seated myself at a theater because my intuition told me the movie was something different i was regretting what my curiosity had made me act when it started showing the regret however had changed into joy for expectation ten minutes later br br this film is a tragic mystery more than a horror painful more than horrible beautiful more than sensational that may have a hard core horror fan disappointed but for a mystery fan like me this film is a must see 9 out of 10
<START> frank it isn't that i'm sorry i killed them it's that i'm sorry i killed them badly br br wow talk about a swing and a miss you have a great cast and a great plot with endless how do you f ck that up well apparently john dahl has found a way with an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable 'you kill me' might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007 on a positive note ben provides another great performance as the alcoholic polish hit man trying to get clean but the material he has to work with is crap tea leoni is good as well as is luke wilson dennis farina bill pullman philip baker hall and the rest of the cast i guess the best way to describe 'you kill me' is a terrible movie with good performances grade d
<START> meet cosmo jason priestley a nerdy young bookie content with his boring life crunching numbers for the mob and living in a stark basement apartment at a senior citizens center his only recreation is watching tv and the occasional tryst with his quirky prostitute pal honey janeane garofalo but one day all this changes when the mob boss is killed and the well regarded cosmo is selected by the smooth and persuasive new chief gordon robert loggia to become a full fledged hit man it's an offer the reluctant cosmo cannot repeat cannot refuse and he quickly trades in his mundane solitary existence for a crash course in revenge under the tutelage of veteran mobster steve peter riegert a relaxed suburban bon vivant who relishes the job's maximum pay and minimum hours in no time cosmo surprises both himself and mentor steve by displaying an absolutely uncanny aptitude for the work though he's never touched a gun before cosmo proves to be both a crack marksman and after an initial wave of moral hesitancy a cool detached killer soon cosmo is dispatching deadbeat clients with speed and style and his natural flair with a gun quickly establishes him as an invaluable addition to gordon's mob br br reality gets in the way though when one night while being massaged by honey cosmo admits feeling a bit uptight and she recommends he try yoga to relax cosmo takes her advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named jasmine kimberly williams cosmo is instantly taken with the kind and gentle jasmine who soon becomes drawn to cosmo now if she can just get rid of her pesky abusive boyfriend randy josh charles maybe she and cosmo can actually start something cosmo using some of the skills of his new trade eventually persuades randy to disappear and his relationship with jasmine takes off br br writer director m wallace a two time emmy award winner for his work on the tracy ullman show and the simpsons has fashioned a script fusing his three genre loves i like comedies gangster movies and romances explained so i essentially smashed together all three to create this film but what he's come up with is a film so disjointed and improbable that it looks just like a very long sketch on saturday night live it's monotonous tone doesn't so much match it's droll sense of humor as underline the fact that a lot of money was spent on a vehicle for jason priestly to blithely shatter his nice guy image which doesn't even fully succeed because he plays his character not as a nerd but as a laconic zombie a nerd may be naive but a nerd has passion passion for inwardly directed things but priestly plays his character as mentally deficient almost the anti forrest gump unfortunately coldblooded doesn't have the sense of scope to actually be the anti forrest gump br br peter riegert local hero animal house turns in a fine performance as usual and kimberly williams does her best with what she has to work with but janeane garofalo hbo's larry sanders show is practically wasted in her role as cosmo's friend probably not for long though garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be picked and it's just a matter of time before she'll be given a meaty role hopefully doing a tag team thing with marisa tomei br br
<START> i remember the trailer for this infamously weak spin off of conan i saw the movie years later and laughed my head off unintentionally poor nielson her career never had a chance thanks to cobra and red sonja the plot of the movie is this sonja brigitte nielson hails from a tribe of female warriors who were killed off by an evil queen bergman queen steals the orb the female warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy each town she passes by sonja goes on a hunt for queen and later finds out that killed her parents on her quest she reluctantly joins arnold schwarzenegger an arrogant prince named ernie reyes jr and his bumbling idiotic servant paul l smith together they go on a hunt for queen and the orb the acting is sub par and the action scenes are soso i mean neilson looks so emotionally distant for someone who lost her whole family as well as her female comrades sonja doesn't look at all arnold is playing his usual stoic role and ernie reyes jr what an annoying snot nosed brat he was in this movie the moronic manservant had more personality than these guys the action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the movie even though sometimes they fall flat the scene where they fight the mechanical sea creature made me laugh till my ribs ached the dialog is a hoot also its as if the screenwriter thought that nobody was going to take the movie seriously so he gave everybody stupid lines to work with i can only recommend this movie to you if you like your epic movies extra campy anyone else don't bother
