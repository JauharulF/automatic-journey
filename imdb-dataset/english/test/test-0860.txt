<START> went looking for this movie after i read tom red storm rising novel timeless masterpiece about 13th century russians being invaded by the germans movie was made in 1938 under orders from joseph stalin to warn soviets about hitler and germany battle scenes are wonderfully done showing that you don't need computer animation to make a great fight scene probably sergei eisenstein's greatest work also see any history buff or poli sci major should watch this movie 10 out of 10
<START> when you see barry corbin in the cast of a movie you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash guess which category solo falls into apparently derived from a popular sci fi novel weapon solo stars mario van peebles as a human looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination he hides out in a mexican village obviously to save money on locations and extras paying in is cheaper than paying in dollars i suspect william sadler is along for the ride as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy van peebles van peebles manages to beat them all with ease of course while corbin watches all this with bemusement from afar the movie is a horrible ripoff of the the terminator and cyborg series and apparently has little to do with its source material it is horribly written and acted and the big fight at the end if downright comical van peebles a decent actor elsewhere is a scream as he pretends to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh he looks like he is doing the robot dance most of the time
<START> i sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom i look here on imdb even though it is not high on the list it is in the top 250 i was a little even though yes i am very impressed with robin and matt's acting abilities they still didn't save the movie i'm not sure what i really didn't like about the movie maybe it's because i math maybe i'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours even though i loved american beauty but that was it i just want my 2 hours back it was a big waste of my time if i'm missing something in this movie please e mail me i am curious why this is on the top 250 and don't say because it was a good movie br br 2 10
<START> a brilliant and sensitive movie with interwoven plot lines as a general warning the movie turns quite dark about half way through as sudden as it is this is a change that i found fitting to the themes of the movie particularly the comparison of the to the filthy rich and as is said by finn at the end how each person makes up the tribe and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person br br anton yelchin finn earl is spectacular in this movie he is probably best known as chekov from star trek or kyle reese in terminator salvation but he's been in a whole plethora of movies you've probably never heard of alpha dog which is another brilliant performance on part house of d hearts in atlantis to name a few the point is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own other excellent performances from diane lane and donald sutherland are what takes this movie up a notch from great to excellent
<START> what a stupid idea ewoks should be enslaved and tortured utterly useless as a species fine you want ten lines of text regarding my unending hatred of ewoks fine here it is fool first of all they are an inferior race that would be slaughtered en mass had lucas not the entire series with their foul presence they're little bears with large asses and they probably smell like donkey crotch yeah i said it donkey crotch they have little to no technology whatsoever resorting to using sticks as makeshift weapons i'm surprised they even had access to fire their guttural language makes my skin crawl can't suppress anti ewok rage ahhh
<START> what i got was something better br br just like many movies i've commented on as of recently i'd been looking forward to this one for a while especially after i saw one of other films blue spring which is easily in my top 20 favorite films i loved the trailer for 9 souls and i thought it sounded very good i didn't hear anything bad about it now i know why br br this movie starts up as sort of a comedy then during the last half of the film it quickly becomes something else it becomes more dramatic as each of the characters face their own tragedies each character gets just enough screen time and you care about what happens to each of them even though there are 9 characters we have to learn and care about within just two hours pulls it off brilliantly br br after i saw blue spring i was hoping the soundtrack would be at least a little bit as good as it was in that film i got my wish because the soundtrack to 9 souls was also incredible the music used in each scene more specifically the more dramatic ones is just simply wonderful i loved every second of it br br i wasn't sure whether or not i wanted to see another film but after i saw this i'm going to definitely also because i read the plot for it and i think it sounds really good i'm looking forward to it on the r1 dvd of 9 souls there are two interviews with he says he's completed another film and he wants to start writing the screenplay for his next i can't wait for both br br i highly recommend this film you must see it now
<START> the last of the airport sequels this has alain delon and george kennedy who was in all the airport movies as pilots david warner as the radio engineer susan blakely as a newswoman targeted for death robert wagner as a brilliant scientist stop laughing eddie albert as a president of the airlines charo in a dreadful comical bit john davidson as a newsman love how his hair stays in place even after the plane turns upside down poor martha raye is humiliated cicely tyson plays a mother who is flying a heart for her dying son stop rolling your eyes jimmie walker as a clarinet player what did i say about not laughing mercedes as a russian gymnastics coach ok you can laugh at that one bibi as a hooker and sylvia kristel and sybil danning as love interests br br just pathetic full of stupid plots and dialogue that will have you roaring watch for davidson getting married on the plane near the end the concorde is taking all these people to russia they're attacked with missiles escape land safely in france and take off again the very next day don't you think the flight would have been cancelled or something most of the acting is terrible is a sight to behold in a red fright wig and a horrible fake accent the only good acting is from kennedy and delon looking fantastic who gives a very engaging performance still that's not enough to make you sit through this drivel too long and lousy special effects too this was a mega bomb and thankfully stopped universal from doing anymore
<START> first of all this is one of the worst soft core straight to cable erotic thriller i've ever seen in my life of course like all erotic thrillers are want to do it's about a brothel madam and is set in a brothel this of course makes the softcore simulated sex that pops up every other 10 minutes seem in context whatever br br forget for one moment that this was never meant to win any awards the actors are terrible and their line reading made me cringe the woman who plays the female cop is so bad it's beyond description she must be a really really good friend of the guys who put up the movie for this terrible adventure if you know what i mean br br the production values are only slightly higher than porn other than that i suppose if you're really drunk and you need something to laugh at this would be a perfect film and if that's the case i recommend fast forwarding to all the scenes with the female cop what's that accent brooklyn hilarious
<START> i was really looking forward to watching this documentary on what i considered to be some of the most entertaining films ever made growing up in l a during the 60's many of these old black and white films were shown on the local stations i even remember a friday night show called strange tales of science fiction that showcased a different sci fi flick every week this documentary however spent way too much time on the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic movies of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their filmaking br br that is not what i was hoping for in this documentary it really could have been a comprehensive examination of the decade instead of a brief highlighting of the most well known films of the era anyone who has studied or been interested in these films are pretty familiar with standouts such as war of the worlds forbidden planet the thing the day the earth stood still etc i would have liked to see some excerpts from lesser known films and perhaps some interviews with people involved in the making of these movies i would have to agree the documentary was way too focused on spielberg's opinions and was a type of commercial for his new release of war of the worlds
<START> final draft a screenwriter james van der beek locks himself into his apartment and succumbs to psychosis in an attempt to write a horror script not a terrible premise but the execution is awful this feels like a first year direction and writing job and probably is the director jump cuts the hell out of everything it's meant to be disorienting what it is is annoying so much so that small chunks of film are incoherent the writing is predictable and doesn't use follow through on most of the ideas it offers bag of oranges it's like they ran out of time and slap dashed it together for the toronto film festival br br this film is not jaw droppingly oh my god it's so bad it's good bad it's boring bad and irritates you for a long time afterward james van der beek is not a terrible actor and keeps the ship barely above water but he's too normal for the kind of psychosis the film tries to offer he is merely a withdrawn guy who one day sees people and hallucinates things then decides to act mildly deranged cause follows effect maybe there's something in the water now lucio who plays his friend is a terrible actor he shares the likeness of chris and is even more annoying a superhuman achievement br br the atmosphere the film provides is good dull gray and somber but as it's the only thing the film achieves it means nothing this film wants to be jacob's ladder or the machinist it isn't even secret window it's the preppy girl in class deciding to turn goth br br not terrible but the sheer stupidity of it will ebb at you i've already put more thought into this critique than the filmmakers did for this br br d
<START> it is fascinating how this title manages to slip by the average viewer as something new and groundbreaking quoting some of the comments k must have thought by himself oh great elephant what a fantastic movie i'll try hard to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices sadly enough he even failed with his outrageous idea the movie turns out a complete failure considering that it tries hard to catch the brilliance of gus van elephant it makes it look even more ridiculous a most embarrassing faux pas for a film director br br the movie starts off with the suicide of a student in the schools bathroom this scene already shows the awkward acting skills of each one involved in this scene you don't buy a single word they say in carries on interrupted by short interview styled bits of the kids who live on their marry lives with each bit rather distressing in its plain stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue means to introduce the characters this way to give a kind of fast as junk food insight look into their hearts and fails once again not five minutes later ultimately screams at the audience yes people i stole this movie and for some curious reason i am proud of it by taking gus van most unmistakable narrative style from elephant he shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation hm doesn't this seem awfully familiar to me this certain level of very forgiving tolerance had been right there to a point at which i couldn't stand this dreadful movie any more shame on you k i say i am especially surprised that 2 37 has reached the official selections in cannes as of 2006 whereas everyone must have certainly remembered elephant 2003 at the very same film festival just a few years ago so how in the name of the lord did this most disgraceful rip off end up being shown there i find myself absolutely puzzled by this mistake br br directors like use the ignorance of audiences who aren't and cannot completely be aware of every independent film out there as elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema although it is without a doubt a masterpiece few people notice that the story as told in 2 37 had been told before how that is possible at a film festival of such importance as attributed to cannes i cannot say it is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in it br br 2 37 is by all means solely commercial worthless as an independent film and on a certain level rather a phoney parody of its obvious idol elephant
<START> a sprawling overambitious plotless comedy that has no dramatic center it was probably intended to have an epic vision and a surrealistic flair at least in some episodes but the separate stories are never elevated into a meaningful whole and the laughs are few and far between amusing ending though 1 2
<START> this was a pretty dull movie actually i think the problem with a french horror film is that the french must be easy to scare or something because this movie wasn't just that frightening the special effects with the mummy's ghost looked like they didn't even belong in the film as though someone put them in during post production to spice them up because the actors barely react to them br br the plot just kind of meanders which is the opposite of real storytelling i guess this was based on a french tv series where they had to distill it down to a two hour movie br br the plot is that a mummy is brought out of storage in the louvre which apparently has such weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break into it multiple times so that's how people keep stealing the mona lisa the boyfriend and the police officer from the 1960's version of this film get together and try to exorcise the demon br br so i'm not sure if this mummy was supposed to be a bad guy or not he kills two guards during the course of the movie but he just wants to get to the afterlife
<START> i am a huge eric roberts fan i collect his movies and so far has get to 60 but iÂ´m honest to say that sometimes he really makes awful movies but hey thatÂ´s why i like him he is entertaining br br but this one has to take the price i canÂ´t stop wonder why somehow they managed to get eric and also corbin bernsen to the picture br br while bernsen is plain awful i really donÂ´t like him roberts manage to be the best thing in the movie and that doesnÂ´t mean much he practically do it on routine basis br br the female lead looks like a plastic doll and acts like one to and tim and his crew looks like action man plastic dolls and acts like those to br br the plot is really embarrasing i havenÂ´t seen any of the carnosaur movies so i canÂ´t recall on the footage that has been added from there but it explains some things but still there are holes huge as in the plot br br spoilers alert br br the first attacks are located outside the laboratory in the woods nearby but at the end they blow the whole laboratory in pieces and just relax that everything is over but they forgot about the ones outside br br when the helicopter pilot is eaten alive i wonder how she notice a t rex climbing into the chopper br br the guys in orange overalls is my favourite what are they doing out for a jogging round or what br br of course there are a b movie standard sex scene with silicon titties involved too this time itÂ´s that greets us i donÂ´t have any problem with that she looks awful but to look at a guy squeezing tits and being on the verge of climax for 8 minutes is just tooo long br br shame on you all including eric roberts now i look forward to watch con games i wonder
<START> did anyone notice when miss brook went skinny dipping she left the water wearing white bikini bottoms and yet had previously taken it all off to join cabin boy this could have been a good film without miss brooks phony accent and a year on the island please how come that kelly looked always clean and ready for a fm photo shoot what started out with premise turned in to soft porn and billy zane come on you cant be that hard up for film offers check out dead calm also when the people took her away how come she scoffed her face and after all that time didn't feel like throwing up i suggest billy find decent scripts kelly stick to photo shoots and cabin boy play the son of zorro in a future sequel
