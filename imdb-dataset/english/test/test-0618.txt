<START> violent sequel to robocop was directed by irvin kershner never say never again the empire strikes back will never be as good as the original because it is almost humorless and it is extremely mean and should have been rated nc 17 because of scenes with infants being involved in gunfights people threatening to brutally murder very young infants with real automatic weapons and even scenes with a 12 year old using lots of explicit profanity giving drugs to lots of random people shooting and graphically shooting up and killing policemen and swat officers opening fire on police officers when lots of small and young children are present and a whole group of children using strong profanity and beating up the store owner who is a very old man of an electronics store and stealing and destroying lots of items there this film gives new meaning to the term appallingly mean but the effects and action sequences are exceptionally incredible overall an ok movie
<START> this movie is based on the true story of christopher boyce and his friend lee this fascinating story takes place around the time of the dismissal in which during his time as a clerk for christopher was privy to classified correspondence which admitted the cia's involvement in australian political and union circles the movie shows several scenes involving gough transmitted over us tv where events take place which confirm the classified documents that christopher had read previously the removal of gough was an organized cia coup elsewhere in the film it was mentioned that most people have no idea about the level of deception that goes on ultimately to ensure that the us is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the behest of everyone else in the current age nothing has changed br br christopher's life was profoundly affected read shocked by his knowledge of what and how the cia shapes foreign including the of allied nations to the united states christopher reacted probably not in the best way at the time by selling top secret information to the soviet union with lee acting as his exchange eventually christopher and were captured and convicted of treason br br on 23rd may 1982 whilst serving time in us prison christopher boyce agreed to a one and only interview with ray martin of 60 minutes australia because it was the australian connection that profoundly affected him it caused a in the australian media for about a week then it went hushed br br i liked the movie's symbolism of the falcon and in it chris was called the falcon and the snowman drug connection but in reality the title falcon was not something that was used by chris br br christopher boyce criminal or man of conscience you decide br br resources http www com boyce html
<START> before i talk about the ending of this film i will talk about the plot some dude named gerald breaks his engagement to kitty and runs off to craven castle in scotland after several months kitty and her aunt venture off to scottland arriving at craven castle kitty finds that gerald has aged and he has grown meaner gerald has certain rules for the castle the rules have been the same for 200 years gerald does not want them to stay but kitty insist on staying by making excuses one night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall it scares her so much that she faints and another excuse they must stay longer kitty becomes more worried about gerald after she tries to go in the maze but gerald catches her and is even meaner to her kitty then sends for reinforcements she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friends who don't really do anything blah blah blah kitty and her aunt end up in the maze where the most suspense of the story is they somehow get separated and they try to find each other but the aunt stumbles upon the creature here it is the moment we've all been waiting for what is the creature lurking in the shadows it is a giant frog omg what is better than that after seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs oops i mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle the frog then leaps out an open window we then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog gall towards us oh yeah this movie was in 3 d but you want to know what is funny is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is 1 10 the size of the frog before it takes the leap it is then revealed that this was all evolutions fault blah blah and kitty and gerald get married then the last shot of this masterpiece is of the grave of the frog in the maze the only place where he was ever really happy
<START> this production is an insult to the stooges especially moe it is inaccurate and poorly acted many of the events depicted just didn't happen that way and too much was left out or skipped over read the books written by moe and his daughter joan instead this was a waste of time
<START> when the film started i got the feeling this was going to be something special the acting and camera work were undoubtedly good i also liked the characters and could have grown to empathise with them the film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy br br however as the film went on the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene i was unable to understand the connection between the stories all i could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles without that connection i was just left with a few unremarkable short stories br br am surprised it did so well at cannes
<START> i like wes studi especially adam beach but whoa is this movie a load of pretentiousness ponderously slow overly cryptic to the point of not because the plot warrants it but because there is almost no plot even less in the way of characterization this is almost like one of those creaky old charlie chan mysteries the cheaper monogram studio versions with lots of red herrings oddball characters like the old ex senator with the checkered past who is now a recluse loads of people getting killed over d'art that you wouldn't look twice at in the mall great scenery though pretty hair on the redhead too although i never did figure out what she was doing in this at all neither could my wife sheesh at least the old b movies had the decency to be short
<START> i don't know what dick steel was talking about but i found this film to be one of japan's most thrilling epics to date as for armageddon or deep impact or for that matter the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison for what i know of films most of the catastrophes in films are basically run of the mill asteroid flicks or one of which of global warming this how ever ran a different course a course of natural means where the earth's crust is beginning to erode to such a degree that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride what the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going to far and sinking japan altogether in most cases this would simply be called shifting on steroids i found the characters rather appealing in every way from the child who lost her mother only to face her own demise among unfamiliar friends or the rescue girl who does all the she can to save lives in the face of disaster or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a dare devil and go with him to safety only to become the hero himself and save his homeland and let's not forget how the rest of the world just them all back only to be forgotten by having the world turning their backs on the japanese citizens who cried for help this was a great movie in all aspects what dick is trying to say is that this movie was not hollywood made that it was made in japan that it had characters which rival other actors around the world that the effects are very gorgeous as he mentioned but it's all he was waiting for and nothing else he lacks the vision of what's important to everyone and why this film had every element of feeling of grandeur and of humanity i thought this film was top rate and i have seen many disaster films to know that japan sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects i have witnessed i really hope shinji higuchi will make another of such films oh and by the way i am not japanese though in many ways i wish i was i am canadian born and raised and an avid movie buff in all aspects visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion dick you should watch it with a more open heart and mind don't just look for the eye candy which makes a films content look for what's more important and understand it they may not be american but the japanese have cornered the market lately for some of the most breath taking and down right gritty film making to date which is why spending 25 000 000 is just what the doctor ordered you heard right 25 000 000 to make this film now you tell me was it worth it or was it worth it because american actors weren't in it
<START> this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score poor acting and total lack or real story or plot even for a b movie this is down right awful after reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it but all the bad reviews were so right i totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it i'm a huge sci fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow do yourself a favor a move on to a different movie they are many other better movies that deal with this subject matter you have been warned
<START> this movie was bad but it was so bad that it may reach cult status in the distant future a sort of film noir meets plan 9 from outer space the story was well there wasn't actually a story there is a place reserved for the ed woods and russ meyers of the world and this film proves it so bad it might be good is the best way to describe it i seriously doubt if this movie will be picked up by any legitimate distribution company therefore it is unlikely to see wide release br br i will add that i expect to see more of actor ron carey he made the best of what he had the rest of the acting if i can call it that was quite forgettable i have seen worse from big studios with vast budgets
<START> north south the television mini series is to the 80's what rich man poor man the first ever tv mini series was to the 70's br br it's a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy from author john jakes the story itself covers the two decades leading up to the years of the election of president abraham lincoln and the imminent proclamation of the civil war north versus south the intertwining stories evolve around the families of the hazards the in the title and the mains and their two central figures of george and orry who form a friendship whilst embarking on their west point training in br br north south is a wonderful historic timeline and as i have grown older and wiser it very much interests me to learn about the contrasting attitudes to such controversial aspects as and and how these attitudes originated br br the series also portrays some great characterisation development as we get to know about the friends and enemies in george and lives and also the women that stole their hearts as young men this aspect of the story also uncovers a romantic tale that is set to the turbulent backdrop of the american civil war br br north south along with rich man poor man is overshadowed by 1977's roots as the greatest mini series of all time however it does come a close second third and also shares the same kind of timeline and themes as roots but don't let this one get away even if it's just to see the great scenery costumes and brilliant all star cast including gene kelly johnny cash elizabeth taylor james stewart olivia de havilland lesley anne down et al br br the series is beautifully crafted and is firmly tied to actual historic events and it's a pity the emmys and golden globes didn't honour a lot more of the actors and actresses for their portrayals patrick swayze and james read the two virtual unknown lead actors at the time turn in compelling performances as orry main and george hazard respectively however it's kirstie alley's riveting performance as george's sister that steals the show many times plus terri garber david carradine and philip casnoff as bent are the delicious villains of the piece you just love to hate br br north south books 1 2 are now available on two dvd sets
<START> standard disease outbreak in remote area expert who happens to be vacationing in the area takes charge movie there are only a few deviations from the norm one is that the kids involved are pretty reasonable from the outset usually they are monsters who repeatedly gum up the works until they redeem themselves in the end another is that the local medicine man witch doctor who is normally an impediment early on is never completely discounted or redeemed in the end perhaps since this seems to have been made for the faith oriented pax channel they didn't want to seem too judgmental about the faithful finally there were no evil local politicians leisure industry bigwigs trying to cover the whole thing up the lack of these stereotypes was refreshing if we have the pax channel to thank for that i may have to sample a few more of their offerings aside from that however this was pretty standard stuff you've seen it all before
<START> admittedly the only reason i watched this film since it's been about a decade since it was released was because of ian holm i was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second favorite character in this play at any rate this film is as gritty as anything the old has produced since jesus of nazareth but some of the best parts of the play have been left out i understand the directing editing choices but i don't think that it really does justice to the play perhaps i'm too much a purist i would have to direct people who have read this far toward branagh's version if it weren't that i despise his tendency toward over dramatization all the same he plays a better hamlet than gibson but then weren't we all waiting for gibson to prove himself as an actor now all he's done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages br br perhaps the only shakespearean worthy acting here is scofield as the ghost
<START> a genuinely creepy ghost story full of chills and sensuality this movie just falls short of what it promises it is apparently based on an old ghost story and perhaps relies a little too much on a simple premise for most of the way its imaginative and genuinely gripping but at the end its almost like just lost interest in it and brought it to a rapid ending br br the story is simple a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so that they can be together but their failure of nerve and his returning ghost condemn them to madness its beautifully handled with imaginative set scenes and the lovers passion is portrayed beautifully but too often the movie fails to really deliver on its promise almost as if loses his nerve in the same way the lovers do br br its a worthwhile movie to watch just to see how combines his great skill as a film maker with some exploitation movie tricks to pull the audience along but sadly its not a true classic in the mold of movies like onibaba or woman of the dunes
<START> i'm guessing that we all no matter if we are fans of cars luv the sound of a dodge challenger as it growls along the road the noise a 57 chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and most of all the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes i'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination but any of the above really does rev my engine there's no denying the importance of transport on cinema it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time space but the car remains the most popular and most luved it's even got its own genre the genre a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars in effect it's just porn car porn and i'm not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel 4 in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars whatever floats your car i guess moving on whilst running on empty isn't quite as pornographic as vanishing point richard c sarafian 1971 for instance with its close ups of the car in motion all it's bumps and curves this doesn't mean that the car isn't the main focus of this film in fact the cars themselves become characters more on that later they're objectified and as much as the women in fact maybe even more and holy holy are these cars something every car in this film besides the ones in the background are simply beautiful Â works of art there's no question about it br br as i was saying these incredible cars are in a way given characters themselves you actually start sympathising with the car spoiler Â most notably during the scene in which the car is being wrecked and burnt spoiler over this has become almost a convention of the genre the evil 1978 plymouth fury from christine john carpenter 1983 satan's custom lincoln mark iii in the car elliot silverstein 1977 the nifty little mini coopers from the italian job peter collinson 1969 to the friendly volkswagen beetle in the love bug robert stevenson 1968 and of course each car from death race 2000 paul bartel 1975 and even wacky races 1968 1970 all of which had their own character ironically however this emphasis on the car often over takes the human characters and this is certainly the case with running on empty in which only one human character the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight has any sort of dimension the rest are very much stock characters these are all your stereotypical australian 1980s teenagers big hair annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in neighbours especially the kylie look a like but who gives a damn it's all about the cars racing and crashing that's it if you don't like that you really are watching the wrong genre br br the car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film and the best thing it's got going for it they are fast very fast and we're not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car at around 40mph and then speed it up oooh no not with this film you don't these cars are zooming along at top speeds in real time Â no fancy editing tricks here so we've got speed check what about crashes check check check whilst there isn't cars crashing everywhere a la the incredibly blues brothers john landis 1980 when cars do crash in this film they certainly crash it would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and they're up in flames it kind of reminded me of thriller a cruel picture bo arne 1974 in that sense br br between these simply awesome scenes especially the very start and the very end there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and in my opinion fail to add very much to the film note more exploding cars needed however there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes Â spoiler especially the attempted rape scene br br so all in all this is a man's film a boy's film full of cars around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too i'd recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen cyclists Â it's a great film which you can just switch your brain off sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume i'll give it 3 5 luvs out of 5 luvs Â p s Â amazon are selling this for just over Â£2 Â it's a real bargain although the dvd lacks any special features whatsoever
<START> this is an astonishingly bad action film i'd say its primary flaw is that it's boring funky wardrobes retro chic set design and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick from being a snoozer mod second major flaw is its lack of character development underscored by the actors' lack of talent i tend to like claire danes's work so i was quite surprised by her non existent performance in this film giovanni ribisi is woefully miscast how could his cotton mouthed bumbling acting style possibly fit into an action flick as for omar epps well he needs to take a few acting lesson to learn how to emote the man had the same facial expression for the entire film my suggestion is to save yourself a few bucks and wait to see this turkey on cable
