<START> this is the most human and humane of movies that i have seen in a long time the ironies abound susan sarandon as a nun tim robbins and susan sarandon in a movie that doesn't preach but neither does it condemn it is cinema verite at it's best and yet the story is fictionalized from several real events br br which of the two is more amazing sarandon or penn it is easy to say who is more likeable but it is hard to say who is more convincing they are simply magnificent br br you may think that all killers should be killed or you may argue that life without parole is no life and that death is more merciful whatever your personal feeling this movie gives you a chance to pause and reconsider br br at the end one simply wants to sit in silence and reflect that is what great drama does it gives catharsis it creates a moment in time a shared memory that touches our humanity
<START> i just finished watching this last weekend and found it absolutely hillarious some of the scenes i just couldn't stop laughing at dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes and just says the things but at the same time he's just being cool to impress his girlfriend who gets arrested anyway the beach scenery is very tranquil until along comes robbie coltrane not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a saturday night when you haven't got much else to do like i did you might need to hunt around for it though i was lucky as my local video store stocks it
<START> out of 15 people i loaned this movie too no one finished it it was so awfully not good just awful she sits in a chair the whole movie she's in a closet the chair she's sitting is nice i can't think of anything more to say but 10 lines of text to print this up my friend nick thinks this is a great movie because he can give it to his friends and not have to worry about those calling him back he's passed it around as a gag movie for 10 years which is how i got it then i tried to get my friends to finish this awful awful piece of crap to no no one could finish it takes boredom to a whole new level they could use this in iraq instead of water boarding please send copies guantanamo bay cuba makes great xmas gift
<START> i watched a made for television film about the destruction at waco texas it was obviously heavily slanted toward the claim that david was a murderous child raping cult leader hell bent on killing as many cops as he wanted and taking his people to the heavens on a blood stained stairway br br the film was little more than propaganda further detailing what we had already read in the newspapers i am more and more sure of that since i watched the great documentary waco the rules of not that every assertion made in this film should be taken as god's truth but it tells the whole story rather than regurgitating only what law enforcement decided to tell br br for those who have forgot was the spiritual leader of the religious movement named the branch davidians charges of drug use kidnapping illegal weapon ownership and statutory rape among others i'm sure raised the suspicions of the local police then later federal law enforcement while attempting to serve a search warrant the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and the clan participated in a shoot out that left deceased and wounded on both sides br br it was then that the federal bureau of investigation fbi got involved communications between the two were spirited but eventually broke down the fbi prepared for an invasion by assaulting the building with flash bang grenades and gas when the building burnt to the ground killing many within including the fbi refused to admit responsibility saying the cult inside must have set it on fire themselves this images of jim jones and other violent religious organizations br br the picture puts on many masks to tell its story it begins with a sampling of the congressional hearings perhaps the truth as far as the record is concerned anyway what is eye opening is how partisan the politicians remained even in a difficult and serious situation as this the democrats were concerned in nothing more than defending every single action taken by law enforcement it was the republicans that seemed open to the other side br br it is impossible to relate all of the new information and analysis provided by this documentary additionally a list would take away from the film opening up as it goes along one example would be the heart breaking fact that children died within the compound the filmmakers probably side more with the davidians in general but stay relatively open to either side in this instance the feds seem at fault for mishandling a situation that involves innocent children but on the other hand the parents also need to shoulder some of the blame for leaving their kids in this harmful situation when they could have released them to any number of local authorities br br probably the most damning new information comes late in the film and involves the fbi's claim they did not fire upon the building this is left up to interpretation and i will not reveal any more than to say it is disturbing and shocking what can and cannot be told br br the federal officers are not held in a critical or corrupt light any more than the largest condemnation seems to be leveled on the media unwilling to tell both sides of a story this element seems prevalent in recent documentaries duly so i believe it is time for the media to return to telling news stories and leave this relentless pursuit of what will draw the biggest audience and ratings br br it is hard to mess up a documentary in most cases switching on a camera and editing together interesting pieces of life is common and tells a terrific story what few can do is shed such new light on a subject that the way you think about it is forever altered waco is that kind of film 5 out of
<START> let me start off by saying that i loved the original grudge it was bar none one of the scariest most hair rising experiences i've ever had in a filled movie theatre i'm not kidding being a self declared also made the flick look better in my eyes if the setting had been changed to some american suburb i probably would've ended up hating the film br br that said this movie is a complete mess i won't say it sucks because a the movie does have some good points b it sucks is the lamest put down in the history of lame put downs so what does the movie have going for it well for starters it has a pretty cool look through filters and the use of bleak washed out colours takashi shimizu almost recreates the downbeat angst ridden atmosphere of the original a few scenes are genuinely shocking and unpredictable unfortunately the rest of the film is just plain bad period br br the story is all over the place needlessly told tarantino style i e the scenes are out of chronological order this technique is pointless in the case of this movie and it merely makes things more confusing frankly a straightforward plot would've worked better the original was also lacking plot wise but it did make sense and the film more than made up for its thin plot with lots of scares and a genuinely tense atmosphere grudge 2 has none of these elements and is just a waste of time br br let's not forget the tv show acting skills which make the cast of the original grudge look like emily watson and katherine hepburn simply put the movie doesn't work it's too slow too dull and just not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot which adds nothing new to the story by the way so not even grudge fans will be pleased br br oh and what is it with the old man playing japanese peek a boo on the bus is this supposed to be comic relief artistic statement or what
<START> before you watch this movie clean your ears take away the make up from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you she doesn't have to this picture will give you both warmth enough to keep your relationship life long enough if you're jew russian ukrainian immigrant yes what popular movie minority so ever laugh within your memories if you're something else or whatever your are anyway laugh for the bittersweet memory of importance of friendship and family it this movie nothing will seem strange how ever strange it may seem still i'm afraid that few will see this movie because it's not the type of picture people watch when they go to movies but please do it for the humanity and don't forget to get the soundtrack for pleasure
<START> contains spoilers br br people who put a lonely heart's ad in the newspaper are often idealists they try to put into a few words everything they are and expect the exchange of letters is full of hope louis jean paul belmondo owner of a cigarette company on the de la reunion east of madagascar is so affected by the letters of julie that he proposes to her but not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the mississippi but catherine deneuve and we know from the start that she is a marriage imposter and that a crime has taken place she shows no interest in julie's wardrobe she does not even get her trunk open and neglects her canary until it dies but the most basic tricks of seduction an open zipper are sufficient to transform louis into a pliable little dog first a joint bank account and then when julie's sister draws attention to herself the flight with 27 850 millions of louis' 28 millions she would have needed his signature for the entire sum br br louis and julie's sister engage a private detective michel bouquet louis contrives to trace marion deneuve's real name in where she works as taxi girl her gangster lover left her penniless or rather louis finds himself unable to kill her she tells her story orphan precocious lesbian experiences many jail and soon she leads him by the nose again the detective turns out to be sly as a fox and tenacious as a blood hound louis and marion bury his body in the cellar they flee to paris where louis discovers that marion has a costly taste she worships money like a deity he sells his firm at a fraction of its value but when the corpse of the detective is discovered a flood they have to flee again without the money life in a mountain lodge together with a whining loser marion can think of a more cheerful life without this appendage br br a high point in the careers of everybody involved belmondo's self deceit makes him nearly endearing deneuve looks beautiful in her wardrobe by yves st laurent and her performance is delightful at first she fakes the fragile too timid to ask her husband for money that's why the joint bank account is needed but after being exposed she sounds like katharine hepburn in the jail scene of bringing up baby the scenery is spectacular the tropics the riviera paris truffaut directs with self evident aplomb the sixties were the only decade when european films were head and shoulders above american productions after this film truffaut was able to look his idol alfred full in the face
<START> pretty stereotyped good looking cast the story loops in a wide and confusing arc leading you down a number of garden paths without attendant fairies before plummeting to an end that feels you leaving hollow br br if you are after a film that has climax or ends with a satisfying thump this is going to be a disappointment inspite of the main character's overt sexuality i felt that he was androgynous lacking a clear male persona rather like his lacking of a clear french persona even though he is laid naked or rather sat naked at the end of the film the viewer is as unaware as the character as to motivations that little thing called plot probably a stereotypically english speaking point of view at least if you take the side of the film
<START> after a very disappointing part 3 i kinda wondered if i should even bother with the next karate kid while i could see why this saga wouldn't continue i still enjoyed the next karate kid most out of the second and the third karate kid movies while there are some very unrealistic moments and situations it was very enjoyable and the story is a catchy and warm one br br hilary swank has this girl come far or what she plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when sort of babysits her per say he notices that she has karate skills he offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first karate kid but i would recommend this one i think you'll be pleasantly surprised br br 7 10
<START> this is without a doubt the stupidest movie of all time br br i don't know who i'm angrier at the idiots who made this or my video store for actually carrying this piece of crap br br i can't even begin to name all of the things wrong with this horrible wanna be movie br br all of the dialogue sounds like it was made up on the spot and the acting is the worst i have ever seen in any movie ever br br there is nothing about the script that would appeal to any decent person in fact i don't think they even had a script they just made up everything as they went along and you can tell br br the women i e men dressed up in drag trying to look like women in the costumes looked so ridiculous i guess they were trying to be sexy but not so much especially that old woman disgusting br br there is nothing scary about this movie the only thing scary is that somebody else might actually rent it and have to watch it br br no brain required for watching this you must be a total loser to want to see this movie br br don't forget i warned you
<START> i liked this probably slightly more than terror by night though not enough to give it the extra the beginning is just brilliant as we peek in on nazi agents scheming to get their hands on a new bomb sight and its inventor in a small swiss village only to be foiled by a disguised holmes who spirits the scientist back to london once there he does everything he can to keep the scientist from falling into the hands of the man behind it all not hitler but worse holmes' arch enemy moriarty of course the scientist disappears leaving a tantalizing coded note and holmes goes in pursuit once again in disguise a climax in moriarty's dockside lair is suitably exciting and we can all guess that all ends well can't we slightly over the top patriotic message as the credits roll now that i think of it the fine sense of place despite the obvious sets rathbone's use of disguise and the way in which so much plot is crammed into just over an hour what the heck it gets that extra and is my favorite of the 5 rathbone bruce films i've seen to date br br watched on dvd part of the 50 mystery classics set from mill creek entertainment many of the transfers on these el cheapo box sets are of very poor quality but holmes fans take note that the rathbone bruce films there are 4 on this set are all quite watchable and reasonably sharp
<START> even though i have great interest in biblical movies i was bored to death every minute of the movie everything is bad the movie is too long the acting is most of the time a joke and the script is horrible i did not get the point in mixing the story about abraham and noah together so if you value your time and sanity stay away from this horror
<START> i read comment and thought they must have been watching an entirely different picture br br i just watched the film this morning and was quite surprised br br to address comments br br trail street is a very well done western br br and randolph scott was in it quite a bit br br gabby hayes was funnier than i've ever seen him br br the bad guys had very good as far as i was concerned br br plus br br it was interesting to see robert ryan as a straight laced good guy he's usually so slimy br br in all a good western very well acted and written br br i liked the background story of kansas and the winter wheat that supposedly helped it become a state too br br i thought the girl who played susan was lovely can't think why she didn't become a bigger star
<START> dire dismal awful laughable disappointing br br right your trapped in the cave with several hard men and a woman or two your being systematically killed by something and you still don't get to hear any naughty grown up words a 15 here in england and you could tell br br the egos of the macho men was just too much pass the bucket i'm going to be sick br br this movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically be kept in the darkest deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever i have a feeling that this description isn't the first time to pop its his head from a hole in the ground br br just like the film the cube it looked like a good concept but was just let down at the last post by well its self br br this comment contains spoilers alright its called the cave br br thanks bruce
<START> having watched the show for about four weeks which is enough to get a feel for the show i think it shows potential whilst much is borrowed from other shows what sci fi doesn't these days and the characters are stereotyped i like what they are doing with the stories there is some continuity with plot development and character interaction relationship building despite the essentially modular nature of each episode there have been some science related topics explored as well as character secret weakness revelations these have also added some comedy to the show something i would gladly see more of in serious sci fi in all this makes for good balance such that can appeal to larger groups of people unlike the star trek vs babylon 5 debates i've been numerous participant and witness to the visual aspects of the show are more than adequate and well budgeted for a first season the acting is acceptable and i am curious to see how well the actors manage to grow their characters out of their scripted stereotypes i see enough positives and potential to remain interested in seeing where the show wants to go
