<START> i cant put it any simpler than that this is a terrible film i've worked in the industry and made several short films myself so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously i absolutely hate this film i haven't made a comment on imdb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others it is a piece of sh t the writer director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager the characters are unrealistic the lead woman doesn't think of taking the policeman's pistol yet is resourceful enough to improvise a molotov cocktail please and not even likable hell i hated her and cheered when she died i don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon redneck idea but it just looked like sloppy writing and convenient bullsh t with no real thought behind it to me this is officially the worst movie i've seen all year congratulations you now rank up there with such greats as micheal bay in the prestigious shouldnt be allowed to waste millions of dollars on making a film club i hope you read this i really do and to the 163 idiots that rated this film 10 out of 10 oh my god i hope a redneck demon appears conveniently behind you and tortures you
<START> i lived next door to the author in 1980 when he first moved out to portland from grove ill with two of his high school buds he seemed like a normal enough guy though he had a lot of artistic pretensions within a few years he jumped into post punk music scene with buddy phil and a few others and a band that definitely wasn't headed anywhere although it got him a lot of action including a fling with courtney love in her portland groupie days he seemed to think his musical prospects were good enough to move to san francisco then n y c br br i was surprised to hear that he got a publishing deal in '95 after the band crashed and burned courtney love's name seemed to be the clincher i have no idea how the movie came about especially with this cast but i doubt that gus van sant was involved anyway the reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not so i would just say that this is the work of a fairly intelligent guy who wants to be a writer or artist or something but doesn't have anything to say like kerouac without the benzedrine
<START> people criticize because it is a low point in bond god sean connery's career and because it is unofficial may contain spoilers first of all this movie is better then any other bond film featuring any other actor then connery all sub par wannabes in my book sean connery is the only real bond no one comes even close to his toughness good looks and sex appeal yes this movie is a low point in connery's bond career but it is still the best bond film of the 80's sean connery is the only bond actor who is good at an older age he did not become a baggy mess like moore but kept his good looks and toughness but gaining some gray hair so what hes still the only real 007 and he is as cool and tough as ever sean connery is the one and only 007 and this movie is definitly worth seeing no matter what anyone says no gun barrel opening but you can't have everything can you great theme song though
<START> hard to believe this was directed by fritz lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries this movie has a cast that includes robert young randolph scott dean jagger and john carradine scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving jagger's life jagger works for western union a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about indian attacks and bandits scott is in charge of the men and young is a telegraph expert who can't shoot a gun but can ride scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but scott can't tell anyone it's a pretty good western and lang should of directed some more westerns
<START> this film was the one of the first of the 70s women in prison film genre this movie was incredibly violent with lots of sadistic torture being inflicted on the inmates the film takes place in the phillipines which looks like a horribly ugly country no doubt the producers used this factor to their advantage to emphasize the gruesome situation that the prisoners were in br br blaxploitation movie queen pam grier has the starring role in this movie she plays blossom a renegade who gets thrown in the vile women's prison on trumped up charges her boyfriend played by sid haig tries to rescue blossom he and blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction and incarceration was orchestrated by the corrupt government br br pam grier and sid haig stand out amongst the otherwise lackluster cast the film itself put way too much emphasis on violence perpetrated against the prisoners their captors just used them solely as objects of their sadism this got boring real fast this movie could've used more interesting plot lines and subtlety this is not one of roger corman's better pictures the many women in prison films that followed this one were much better all around i'd recommend the big bird cage only to pam grier fans
<START> wow i just watched this movie american people have this stereotypical view towards hindi films such as all indian films have dances songs and a love story its pathetic how far away from the truth that is this film simply exposes the stereotypical western view of hindi films horrible acting horrible direction horrible cinematography and all this by a hollywood director most indian films today are much more content driven realistic touching and meaningful than this piece of crap indian cinema not just hindi also cover a variety of different subjects just like most other hollywood films these days this shows a very stereotypical view of of another country where truth is thrown out the window this is a highly not recommended movie instead watch good hindi films like black friday khakee gangster don dor sholay mother india lagaan those films are what real indian cinema are all about
<START> a year after her triumphant first special my name is barbra barbra streisand with her production team to produce this follow up cbs tv special in then revolutionary color first broadcast in march 1966 color me barbra follows a similar format to its predecessor three segments the first two with unique concepts the first takes place in the after hours halls of the philadelphia museum of art where dressed as a period maid she roams the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through song in various guises streisand expresses a variety of moods from the comedy schtick of the minute waltz to the melodrama of non c'est rien in a painting to the beatnik style frenzy of gotta move set to abstract art my favorite moment in the special is when she transforms into a dead ringer of queen while singing a haunting rendition of rogers and hart's where or when br br opening with another comic monologue full of silly non sequiturs this time in french the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly colored circus medley where she interacts with animals including her beloved poodle sadie she finds an appropriate context for sam you made the pants too long with a bevy of penguins and comically compares her profile to an with we have so much in common as with the first special the program ends with a riveting solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts any place i hang my hat is home where am i going and starting here starting now among them also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986 ironically dressed in all white when the special was first released on vhs the juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special and a 23 year old streisand is in peak form
<START> just saw this at the cinema i haven't read the books there is nothing new about this film at all br br the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same ish there are several action scenes but they are very fake filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close move fast and turn the music up this leaves me feeling conned yet again br br i admire them for attempting to tackle a dark storyline without the normal hollywood cheese but i'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably the characters are 2 dimensional we hardly get to know them or feel for them at all the lead has a charming farmers accent oo though it seems he hasn't got much to say br br don't bother watching this unless you are bored and got it half price from blockbusters
<START> this remake is a complete disgrace so mediocre cheap and prosaic it wouldn't deserve more than a couple of spiteful lines br br it's also a cheat with a laughable script served by such contrived and amateurish acting you're always aware there's a set a camera a fake no direction no suspended reality whatsoever to allow you delve into the story br br the claustrophobic stifling tension of the small spaces and rooms in the original japanese masterpieces ju on 1 2 is all but lost here in overblown sets and spaces br br but worst of all the moral enormity and unbearable suffering which both imparted a ruthless logic to the original mother and child victims turned into relentlessly vindictive ghouls is completely ruined by utter nonsense and hollow boogie man style scares br br if american audiences aren't willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator preferring to swallow this kind of patronizing hogwash instead they fully deserve this pathetic curse the movie itself
<START> once in a while one come across a movie that forces one to rethink about society's reaction to people who differ from its definition of normal br br having suffered at the hands of elements left all alone to cope with her tragedy retreats into her idyllic world one which according to her is the real world br br surreal world superimposes itself on the real her family br br suffering from schizophrenia forces us to reconsider our priorities about trying to rehabilitate like them are we right to drag them back to our reality when all we have to offer them in ours is pain and suffering what right have we to deprive them of their source of happiness what right do we have to take away their joy when we are unable to help them in their sorrow 15 park avenue is one of the best movies on social issues showing us the need that any patient needs empathy and not plain sympathy
<START> it was very sensitive very deep it's my favorite all the time you can't see movie more deeper than this incredible movie susan sarandon made her role as matured mind actress and she realized her role she deserved the award she convinced me with for being a nun the music was very impressive and sensitive really i liked this deep masterpiece
<START> all right guys here's the deal with this movie it's not the best but for all of you 80s kids out there it'll bring back fond memories of your childhood personally i love this movie i still love rainbow and the care bears so in my opinion if you aren't a kid now or were a kid that loved and or loves rainbow you won't like this movie at all
<START> first there are some plot holes in this movie we see in the very beginning a kid dies from playing the game but who was tied up in the mail truck delivering the package which contains the game how did the driver place the package into the mailbox when he was lashed to the steering wheel it is not like he was mr fantastic wow that in just the first 15 minutes the actors are second rate take the bad guy played by patrick kilpatrick who exactly he has appeared in one episode of everything on tv and some secondary roles in poor movies like this one so most of the acting is like tv dramas i can live with that but the graphics or special effects are horrible the disembodied game voice sounds like a poor clone of hal from space 2000 what they called zombies looked more like shadows jumping around like monkeys from planet of the apes the aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies in most cases the movie was just predictable as it had no hook or hidden agenda going the story was a good idea but like most good ideas discussed over lunch was never developed beyond that good idea stage
<START> of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst i took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it br br the script seemed to be based on a willy wonka style story but it just didn't have anything to it br br if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time it is bad br br they are making a sequel so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie but i don't think it is possible
<START> amateur camera work aside i thought this movie was very different and unlike all the blogs and posts i have read i got something totally different out of the ending than others the premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church how they must adhere to all the rigid rules and regulations but the daughter seems to have problems staying on track what with nasty thoughts of others and her use of bad language yet she prays a lot as does her family then one day they are headed to a church picnic and are in an accident from there the parents and her brother change what with being knocked out and saved by jesus warning major spoiler alert or so we are led to believe i think if you watch this movie from the point of view of the daughter only then really pay attention to the end you will see that what we the audience thinks is an actual occurrence with the parents and son is in fact all a dream and from the daughter's pov this would explain a lot of the actions portrayed by the parents and the son which were totally opposite of how they lived before especially the sex and also would also explain why peggy got away with murder etc look at how perfect that pie is but go back and look at the cake betty makes that is unless caroline removed all evidence that the pie was laced and also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents laying there in each others arms and her brother all whom of which seemed to die very peacefully even if being poisoned fits with a dream sequence
