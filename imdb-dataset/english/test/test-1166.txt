<START> the best of everything is a high gloss large screen soap opera which follows the careers of four career women hope lange suzy parker diane baker and martha hyer at a new york publishing firm what's the best for some women is not necessarily the best for all br br presiding over this group of young is wise old mare joan crawford who's been around the track a few times on screen and in real life she looks right at home as the boss lady as well she should have at this point br br around the time she was making the best of everything joan crawford became a widow when her fourth husband alfred steele died it was a particularly traumatic event for her she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her she inherited all of his stock in pepsi cola where he was the board chairman and during the same period as the best of everything was being made she wound up the queen bee at pepsi cola life does sometimes imitate art so that authority as she barks out and coffee orders to hope lange rings real true br br in fact all the women here with the exception of lange are in for some rough sledding it's rough for lange too but she literally makes the best of everything br br what a collection of stinkers the men are in this film the best of them stephen boyd is a heavy drinker the others louis robert evans and brett halsey are as slimy a collection of rodents as ever gathered for one film br br i can't forget brian either who's the fanny pinching head of this publishing firm half that office would have sexual harassment suits going today br br some nice location shots of new york in the fifties make the film a real treat catch it by all means
<START> the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has it's a genial summer camp movie so the jokes aren't mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule pranks do take place but you get the feeling that the respective fall guys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to fall for them and without being too cheesy it's actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the end br br it's an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is bill murray for me he's still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose no one's better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day everything's silly yes but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of good natured fun meatballs promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch
<START> i watched this movie in 75 and this movie was a kind of open mind to me about how important is to care the and the wild life when i got a dog in 83 i called him in movie dog to never forget this movie br br by the way i have a copy this movie but is in portuguese language and the quality is not so good like a dvd or a new vhs i recorded almost 20 years ago and in speedy so the quality is not so good br br if somebody wish a copy i'll try convert to dvd and i can send for you ok br br a great movie and i agree that is a movie to be always watched br br waldemar sao paulo brazil
<START> i found it real shocking at first to see william shakespeare's love masterpiece reworked into a gory violent and kinky sensual movie adaptation but after you watched it once it sort of grows on you when you watch it the second and third times as you come over the shock and start appreciating the movie on its own merits solid acting good dialogue nice sequencing and choreography not too bad soundtrack and some of the special effects that go on oh and also the ending what a riot
<START> i first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time the opening narrative music and paintings by norman rockwell set the tone for me you either love the movie or hate it jan michael vincent was at his all time best and portrayed cpl marion in a most innocent and touching way this movie is at the top of my all time favorites a shame it isn't available on dvd or vhs anymore the ending was also wonderful john hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time
<START> this isn't a dreadful film merely insipid the plot is deeply flawed and implausible it tries to be a number of genres and fails at each it fails as a comedy as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie it almost succeeds as science fiction the direction is uninspired and katie holmes cute cherub face that she is should be modeling teen clothing not acting the only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is helen mirren her performance is fabulously nefarious and is almost worth suffering through the rest of it her ability to from imperious to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows masterful range other than marissa delightful exorcist rendition mirren is the only reason to see this movie a solid 3 0
<START> much said without words br br this is an excellent movie it was made in color not color as in today's films but a special mono color use with shadings that portrayed meaning mood sense and time it should be seen in color as it becomes an entirely different film the story by nobel prize winner selma is effectively presented one never has a clear sense of real memory or phantom changes going on in swedish society at the time are subtly layered most highly recommend try to rent it or find it on line i saw it in a swedish film class and i want to add it to my film library
<START> this sounded like it was going to be like silence of the lambs or zodiac or something but it wasn't it really was more like one of the halloween movies without all the jump scenes it was a little like plan 9 from outer space in the sense that the main bad guy kept making inane speeches that made me want to go get a snack without pushing pause the idea of a person who is so crazy that he would abduct people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea but the execution was too made for tv feeling i have to say it was better than i expected for a movie written and starring dee snider a good first effort maybe he'll learn some lessons and his next effort will be less clumsy
<START> if you like bad movies this one's a real treat kaufman peters stagger around in robot costumes escape slavery only to wander aimlessly and find true robot love i believe this is the first movie that ever made me consider walking out i should note i was 12 and could be entertained by shiny objects
<START> hal hartley has been likened to a modern day william shakespeare by virtue of the fact that he gets his actors to deliver their lines in an iambic pentameter he certainly knows how to assemble a cast and once again martin donovan is sensational whilst thomas jay ryan plays his role with an intensity that is unforgettable although the film is only 1 hour the time frame works wonderfully and keeps the audience on a fast tracked race right till the very end without a doubt hal hartley is one of the best directors to come out of america in the last 20 years with a vision that is unique funny and heart warming
<START> although films about edgar rice burroughs famous hero tarzan have been seen by movie goers for almost a century now this is the definitive version of the story greystoke is the actual story of the origins of tarzan as set down by edgar rice burroughs way back in the second decade of the last century i've been assured by experts br br tarzan and sherlock holmes are probably the most filmed fictional heroes in history i've no basis in fact for saying that just a gut feeling the most popular holmes was basil rathbone the most popular tarzan was johnny weissmuller and films that they made with both those characters will be criticized no end by purists br br but greystoke is the real deal a faithful adaption of burroughs first story concerning the origin of his hero i can't think of another film which shows that tarzan learned french before english but that is shown here and it's only natural since it was a french survivor of a massacred safari played by ian holm who discovers tarzan who has been raised by the apes since his parents who were shipwrecked on the african coast died there after his mother gave birth br br his parents were in fact the son and daughter in law of the earl of greystoke and the surviving earl played by ralph richardson is of course overjoyed to learn he has a grandson of course there are others who don't welcome the new heir back in society br br one who doesn't is andie mcdowell playing of course jane she does not communicate with tarzan in answer to his grunts and monosyllabic commands tarzan speaks a concise english french and understands the language of the apes as well as for the language of love tarzan and jane need no lessons br br greystoke earned three oscar nominations for best makeup in regard to the apes best adapted screenplay and a posthumous nomination for ralph richardson for best supporting actor it should also have rated a nomination for cinematography of the jungle scenes in and the scenes of the british aristocracy in several landmark places like hatfield house and blenheim palace br br for burroughs purists greystoke is the real deal
<START> it's got action and fantasy mixed all together what more do you want in an action movie and it also has one of the best martial artists in the movie industry today wesley snipes so all in all this movie hasn't left anything out and that's my comment of what i think is a classic beat em up movie
<START> the duke is a film based in the heart of the british aristocracy where an old duke john neville dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats oliver and sophie heyman he passes his down to his dog the dog's best friend an american girl named charlotte played by draper whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former duke due to him being her great uncle a young chef named arrives with him and charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub plot which in its own way acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of hubert the and his many activities and love interests with other dogs all this is watched over by james who plays a butler who is determined to try and serve his old duke by doing his best to serve his new master hubert acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master a fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor br br though from the technical viewpoint i dislike this film as i only watched upon discovering james role though the plot is good elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured ignoring the absurdity of a doggie duke i personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the 'bad' characters due to their ludicrousness the dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me the director phillip uses mid long shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality plus the acting of and heyman whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role br br but as a mature movie fan i find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh i can admit i found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far fetched but has definite connections i do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but i do highly recommend it to dog lovers families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and james fans who wish to see in his final role
<START> i am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this film this movie has no redeeming factors the music is not good the acting is pathetic i have a difficult time understanding how someone could enjoy this movie let alone sing its praises the idea is horrible certain scenes linked to the plot such as the continued love story even though the male romantic interest is a shrunken head are so bad that i wanted to do myself bodily harm while watching them the fact that there is scene in which a shrunken head flies under a girls' shirt so he can feel her up and she likes it is reason enough for everyone associated with this film to perish the link to west side story can only be a mockery since to reference such a great movie in such a horrible one is grounds alone to destroy all copies of this movie to make a long story short this film is horrible in every way and if i had my way everyone who likes it should go straight to hell
<START> much more than any other film from that period night of the demons represents the brainless and hugely enjoyable horror pastiche it's undemanding fun with loads of nasty make up effects gorgeous looking and horny teenagers and adorable clichÃ© elements a group of party animals led by the alternative angela goes to celebrate halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an eerie urban legend it all starts out typical and innocent with dancing drinking and the occasional flirt between youngsters that can't keep their hormones under control but pretty soon a bloodthirsty demon possesses the hostess in the most ingenious ways you've ever seen the rest of the cast gets slaughtered viciously only to return as hideous creatures prowling for blood the thing that makes this film better than most cheesy 80's horror films is finds a good balance between light headed camp and atmospheric horror some sequences really are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies night of the demons with an excellent tone director tenney makes great use of the set pieces coffins a crematorium endless dark and his young enthusiast cast obviously love what they're involved in the terrific make up effects by a whole team of artists and designers are of course the obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics will absolutely love the large amount of severed limbs poked out eyes and crushed skulls the ultimate highlight however is linnea quigley's trick with the disappearing lipstick this nymphomaniac bimbo shoves an entire tube of lipstick in her nipple and continues her sexual murder spree terrific night of the demons received two sequels during the 90's and although they're still definitely worth checking out they focus more on comedy than chills
