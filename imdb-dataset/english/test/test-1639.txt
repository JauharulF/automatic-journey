<START> my friends and i are always on the lookout for chuck norris films to just bash and make fun of one of our favorites so far is i went to a wal mart christmas shopping and i came across this movie in the 5 99 bin i had to get it i had high hopes for this movie and although being absolutely hilarious at times we agreed that bells of innocence is the worst movie we've ever seen made produced thought up etc who the hell would think this is a good idea not only is it confusing at times but the acting is just hard to watch the man who plays oren has acting i can compare to my own vomit and chuck took a dive on this one he's not the greatest actor but this was terrible and what kind of names are oren conrad and come on people if you honestly thought this movie was at all watchable great for you because it was hard for me and i seriously had a headache and stomach pains after watching it i'm telling you now if you haven't seen this movie don't for the love of god please do not subject yourself to such a horrible 90 minutes of your life
<START> so bad as good not only the script is obvious but the acting is not just poor but pathetic the worst of all is the definition of the characters unrealistic ingenuity affected reactions camera forcing to watch superficial aspects which are introduced as keys to the plot br br can't prevent laughing when at the end main character says to second something like 'your daughter plays no soccer and knows no such offense to female intelligence defines the level of this film br br is the film about the psychological behaviour of the second character about its impact on the main character or just a sequence of events set in order to heat for the obvious ending br br make more of these i had a good time guessing what next would go wrong
<START> we just finished screening el padrino in australia a phenomenal piece of film work we look forward to seeing many more films from mr in the future it was wonderful to see such a well put together film with such suspense and a story that shall remain an instant classic seeing a film with great quality truly outlines serious potential and his adept skill as a writer actor director and filmmaker has impressed many with his triumphant performance in blood in and blood out and now he has proved to all who have see his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed film maker with genuine artistic control with his lead role kilo vasquez being a perfect combination between milo from blood in blood out and al pacino from scarface the film will do wonders for us here in australia
<START> i went to the pre screening of rory o'shea was here i like this movie better than i expected because the excellent casts and the powerful performance it's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his duchenne muscular dystrophy he can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal michael who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired i guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama well it is but with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances it made me looking at my life for things i take for granted what would i do if all i can do is to move my two fingers i should feel grateful for what i have and what i am capable of doing this is a good flick although it could have been better
<START> its a totally average film with a few semi alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning the end scene with the flask backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character not really worth watching again bit disappointed in the end production even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality
<START> the depiction of crane's character was so terrifically unlikable my wife and i were hoping that the horseman or some other character would not only cut off crane's head but do it slowly and painfully br br i mean this brent carver guy played it over the top like he was on broadway and he was such a relentless jackass that we had no sympathy for him whatsoever br br i could go on with specific critiques of how this movie failed but i prefer to not devote the energy br br just skip it and go for the johnny depp version either that or rent the haunted pumpkin of sleepy hollow animated it is quite good entertaining for kids and adults br br better yet read washington irving's original story
<START> there were many westerns made in the 30s and early 40s and although this has a strong beginning it isn't one randy bowers john wayne stopping at a house' saloon finds it to be full of dead bodies the corpse draped over the bar holding a gun eyes watching randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture and a player piano playing the loveliest night of the year br br it was the result of a robbery by the marvin black gang to get ed rogers' 30 000 randy is an investigator who works alone who wastes little time in getting arrested escaping with ed's daughter sally's help and literally landing in the midst of the black gang's hideout behind a waterfall it all moves along fairly quickly only one too many chases after randy slow it down br br we even get george hayes clean shaven and playing two parts marvin black the vilest villain as well as the good citizen matt the mute who communicates via handwritten messages having him play two opposite roles was a good idea but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast even for him as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to sally ah i'm fed up with this you can find george playing a vile vile double crossing villain in the serial the lost city 1934 br br i think this is the only 'lone star' film in which the title relates to or is mentioned in the film sally offers her hand to randy and says he's not alone anymore then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake sally's running off with randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff br br not that bad considering everything but not that great either i'd really give it a 4 and a half
<START> the idea behind dead silence is great zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show there was so much going for this film unfortunately as soon as the zombies made their appearance all was lost br br the film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy b flick horror will enjoy it the zombies were soooo stupid they ran around flailing their arms they looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students br br i know this is a brief review but i just don't see the need to invest much into this it's a dumb movie you've been warned
<START> as the film reviewer for a local gay magazine i automatically get sent any dreck if it happens to have a homo in it chicken masala is churning on in the background as i write this i gave it my undivided attention for 53 minutes before i found myself involuntarily shouting like a sufferer this is the sh test film i have ever seen we're just coming to the emotional climax where the son is giving some coming out speech to his father at his wedding father seems to be taking it quite well an attempted honour killing at this point would at least have livened the film up a bit and made it funnier br br i didn't particularly like beautiful thing for example but could at least see why other people did it was made with some professionalism and i seem to remember it had at least a couple of good lines the lack of wit in this film is quite astounding even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognisable jokes the nearest this movie got to being funny at least in its first 53 mins was the subtitled comment delivered to the fat unattractive female lead look at her with her legs wide open she's like the tunnel completely witless and i didn't crack a smile but i could imagine someone with a low iq who perhaps works in a chip shop enjoying it br br i'd imagine it's some lottery funded atrocity if not i can at least console myself with the fact that the backers will lose a substantial amount of money as even a low budget british film will still set someone back a couple of million seriously if i met the most handsome bloke in the world and on going back to his place to make sweet love i found a copy of this in his dvd collection man i love this film i'd probably kick him in the nuts and leave and this from someone who's gone about six months without any of the aforementioned sweet love br br oh lord i hate this film
<START> i had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds probably left over from a bad western blew across the scene the bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening stranger turned human sacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat for the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic made for tv movie music informs us a killing is taking place not a make out session for the next 27 or so hours we are treated to two idiotic psychotics who for some reason seem compelled to drive through the desert southwest together going after each other like a demented abbot costello even with the shocking twists at the end we are merely left to shake our heads and wonder if the producers and director writer feel as ashamed and embarrassed as they should for creating this inconsistent incoherent nonsense
<START> i wish it were last dumb thriller but thrillers are like that they are like children numerous illogical and often annoying they want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a child's behaviour or a thriller's plot having seen this particular child i mean thriller i understand why reviewers refer to it as a hitchcockian thriller they might as well have called it idiotic for that's what hitchcockian means in the movie dictionary look it up if you don't believe me even the soundtrack is old school hollywood which is a mistake it doesn't fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony besides how dare they steal de palma's idea of stealing from hitchcock the story is absurd scheider's wife is killed and her killers are never an issue instead first his former employers follow him around and later decide to kill him why do they decide to kill him no explanation perhaps because the fbi is a dark dark organization x files which is very trigger happy about knocking off its former employees for pension funds reasons or perhaps because it's fashionable to want to kill scheider in this movie everyone seems to be after him and while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy in reality the killer is janet margolin yes the woman occupying scheider's living quarters the one that briefly hinted she was depraved why does she go after scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid and followed by his own ex employers and not a few years earlier or few years after the wife's murder a pure hitchcockian look it up again in the dictionary in case you forgot what it means coincidence and how about that brilliant motive of hers her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh off the boat 15 year old virgin in ny and then by a bunch of horny jewish men one of whom tah dah is scheider's grandfather as a result margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time among other things in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly her once virginal grandmother how hitchcockian look it up is that the finale then shamelessly rips off the mount rushmore scene from north by northwest except that the love interest is a killer and she doesn't get saved br br the movie also offers some dubious off kilter dialog and some not so great acting check out the silly and obvious way in which napier follows scheider at the cemetery let's also not forget the moronic plot device of napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously but it wasn't a gun how brilliant napier in the tower now there's another string of illogical behavioural patterns j demme was is and always will be a director without style without flair and the man who directed philadelphia let's give him another oscar
<START> as a young teen when this came out i completely related to it as an adult in the present sex obsessed american culture it doesn't have enough nudity to be called tame br br if you are looking for american pie type lewdness vulgarity or fart and feces jokes meatballs will disappoint with impunity and a guarantee br br if you like bill murray and you like good clean fun you will probably like and enjoy this film very much similarly with stripes ghostbusters caddy shack etc br br enough said just go watch it and stop it it's meatballs for crying out loud why read a review just enjoy it and have fun and ignore the trash talk by others films like so many other things in life are subjective to each his own br br always beware the who diminishes others' taste
<START> the history of tv to film adaptations are littered with aberrations which almost conclusively prove that the tradition should never have started in the first place there are however some examples which manage to pull it off just rising damp would at first appear to be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment as this hilarious series was based within the tiny confines of a northern bedsit also the writer eric wasn't being paid enough to spend time crafting an entirely original screenplay so he harvested a batch of tv episodes and stitched them together to form the body of the film this in itself didn't necessarily mean that the script would fail david croft and jimmy perry did the same thing with their screenplay for dad's army and it worked superbly although the early dad's army episodes with their staid pace and over plot lent themselves far better to film adaptation the rising damp episodes however were high energy affairs from the first scene to the breathless climax as a result as one story is concluded and another started the scenes within the film become disjointed another pitfall for the movie version of a tv series is the inevitable comparisons that are made in this respect the film pales in comparison to rising brilliant series despite all this rising damp the movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally uproarious it is perhaps not surprising that the finest moments occur during sequences written specially for the film this includes a rugby match where does a brilliantly timed pratfall indeed while all the cast handle their roles perfectly bar a sub standard replacement actor for the late and truly great beckinsale it is leonard as that shines the most in fact rising damp should have been made as a film just so could have been eligible for an oscar such is the magnificence of his acting talent criminally he wasn't even nominated ultimately the film fails to match the giddy heights of the tv series while managing to hold its own as a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments recommended viewing br br one last thing the opening and closing music is by far the worst in film history
<START> after huge budget disaster films set in america like the day after tomorrow and deep impact it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like flood br br using mainly unknown actors and actresses and actually focusing on england it was a welcome change of pace to seeing the empire state building being demolished br br however this is not a strong film on any basis whilst being fairly shocking seeing all your favourite london landmarks being demolished by a very fake cgi storm surge flood doesn't really deliver on anything else br br the performances are bland being saved from the pit of hell by david suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as the deputy he is perhaps a little too calm for what is going on in the film all that fake water gushing around london must have made him pretty annoyed br br it is understandable that the effects weren't going to be as good as and di but the cgi was at best average br br bland disappointing and sometimes even tiresome watch it if you must but watch something else straight afterwards
<START> i went out of my way to get this film and was fortunate to get it on vhs being a big gloria grahame fan it was an excellent addition to my collection other than that i really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture the plot is predictable and weak and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching sterling hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department ms grahame is always fun to watch if you like her as i do but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot she works in a dive so let her use her own voice it can only lend to the atmosphere i must agree with an earlier reviewer the ending borrows heavily from the big heat to the point of detracting from the ending i have seen worse films with ms grahame macao but i will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen if you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film this is your movie enjoy the picture
