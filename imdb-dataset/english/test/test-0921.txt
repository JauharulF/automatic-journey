<START> it's as if the stay puffed marshmallow man from ghostbusters had been reincarnated in rutger body and is taking revenge upon a rival's pregnant wife if seeing an obese hauer chase a very pregnant isabel glaser imagine the spine tingling thrills in that contest sounds good to you see this film seriously if hauer is what an iraqi pow looks like after six years in prison then hungry people everywhere should make a bee line to a jail in baghdad overall tactical assault rates 2 stars instead of 1 because mike mitchell as hawk is terrific mitchell burns up the screen as a nato pilot until his plane is burned up itself by an enemy whereupon the film loses what little verve it had to begin with
<START> i've seen some bible based trash this one tops it all to make matters worse it lasts about three hours a horrible waste of time unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations do yourself a favor take a walk in the sahara instead since i am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it god's conversations with noah are ridiculous the whole thing has a stench of let's make the biblical account look retarded the basic logic goes if they spent the money on a biblical film why not make it worthwhile since the basic logic is not met something is amiss the movie starts with a disclaimer about poetic licenses taken that is the understatement of the century poetic rape but then poetic would be an unmerited favor
<START> when i began watching i thought i was watching some pro amateur documentary however i had never seen 3 4 of the footage they used they interviewed people saying that the fbi instigated all these things which sounded so far fetched but then followed in up with fbi video and testimony i was amazed the documentary followed up with the senate investigation after the fire and after seeing the interview and video footage you will be shocked at how the senate and attorney general turn their backs on davidians basically to cover up the aggression by the fbi if you start watching this you must finish it otherwise you will think it is propaganda of something like that
<START> footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize psychological thriller is the most appropriate description i can think of the female protagonist alice discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel she is also haunted by a recurring very vivid dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago in her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't trust anyone but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold and particularly how it will end the unusual loneliness of the main character and the of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well the important part of the one and only everyone's all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of italian horror is an extra bonus
<START> so funny is the perfect way to describe this 12 minutes spoof of the original star wars hardware wars is incredibly funny it is presented as the trailer of the space epic hardware wars the joke is this imagine star wars played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects the characters include the intergalactic boy wonder fluke the ace mercenary and intergalactic wise guy ham salad nader villain and a host of other fantastic characters it is impossible not to laugh as you watch this 12 minutes treasure it's stupid but it's fun you will laugh from the start to the end and you will feel the need to watch it again and again and again and again and you will laugh every time you see it br br 10 out of 10 the funniest 12 minutes ever made you will believe it lasted a minute
<START> this film is bundled along with gli le colt lo and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints first both films are very dark occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening second neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film though il del does seem to have a better dub personally i always prefer subtitles but for the non purists out there this isn't a problem these dvd problems however are not the fault of the original film makers just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later br br as for the film it's about the assassination of president garfield this is a major problem as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield he's missing the beard has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way trust me on this i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes plus using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho he was a fine actor but certainly not a convincing general or macho president br br in addition to the stupid casting president garfield's death was in no way like this film it's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk not garfield garfield was shot in washington dc not dallas by a lone gunman with severe mental problems not a group of men with rifles however according to most experts what actually killed garfield over two months later were incompetent doctors who and and to retrieve a bullet to no avail and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process in other words like george washington who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia he died due to malpractice in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever other than indeed president garfield was shot br br because the film bears almost no similarity to real history it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury why not also include ninjas fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it aside from some decent acting and production values because the script is utter cow crap i don't recommend anyone watch it it's just a complete and utter mess
<START> gary busey's best performance in a nicely flowing biography since had a musical background he was able to do his own songs and it really works it's always good to see that fine actor don stroud one of the crickets and charlie martin smith as well br br an 8 out of 10 best performance gary busey thankfully mr busey was oscar nominated for this losing to jon voight in coming home a fairly low budget flick that doesn't disappoint with great songs by mr holly i hope this made plenty of dough busey was never this popular again for varying reasons but thankfully he has this one great one on his resume
<START> you might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting but it's far from that take the concept for example the main character s have a big secret that they hide from they're peers it's just like hannah montana and that's so raven next the acting is just average selena gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes lastly the jokes are either clichÃ© or boring if they're not using they're colorful yet strange dialog to make us laugh they are throwing various props around the room i really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material in conclusion of waverly place is a disappointment
<START> it is one of the joys of shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances no single performance can be but some can be wrong and this one is there are at least two things about hamlet which cannot be dispensed with 1 his indecisiveness and inability to take any kind of action for god's sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does if you had othello there instead of hamlet claudius would be dead by the end of act one any production has to try to explain why hamlet delays why he is incapable of action 2 his sexual disgust his total revulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an utter disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with ophelia is impossible at the slightest hint of sex hamlet throws up so what does mel gibson give us lusty action man you could not get further from the character of hamlet if you tried there are lots of ways hamlet can be played but this isn't one of them what i don't understand is since they managed to get such good actors for the other parts claudius polonius and so on why couldn't they find one to play hamlet as well mark rylance in the part would have made this a great film this whoever he is completely let down the rest of the cast and lets face it hamlet without the prince really doesn't work
<START> the many comments made by others have been very informative and i join in their calls for the release of and bess the 1959 film br br in my early teens i joined a record club and this album was one of the free ones i chose for joining i knew some of the voices were dubbed but only robert was acknowledged on the album recently my daughter purchased a cd from austria i think the quality is excellent so i am confused about why it is available in europe by cbs records inc when i have had no luck in local stores br br actually i never saw the movie but for years have pleaded with local video stores to get it now i know why it has never been available br br i add my voice to others who plead with the heirs of the property and rights and that they agree to release it however imperfect they perceive it to be the beauty of the music and story reached so many of us who would never have had the experience otherwise br br trudy
<START> ill conceived sequel the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather brings back the spirit of the psychopath returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which life to his molecules it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept br br i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so exhausting anyway the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival i mean seriously why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this br br the snow anvil murder scene takes the cake ice icicles from the beach's sand so that a victim can fall on them oh and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs br br look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your oh it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie or have you pondering why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense jack frost has the power to freeze water then how were they able to melt him in the first film and causes the island resort to snow one sequence has jack freezing pool water encasing a swimming model under the sheet result being her drowning with nowhere to escape oh there's also a recreation of the tongue stuck to the icy pole bit from the christmas story dude br br i gotta hand it to the cast though they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining christopher allport perhaps unwisely returns as sam to face his old nemesis as does eileen seeley as his wife the attempts at tongue in cheek humor for me at least fell flat but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue br br a development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with jack his genetically altered water molecules thanks to the introduced foreign elements allow him to withstand anti freeze and even worse he now can reproduce through indigestion jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes mouth and sharp teeth the killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans but i personally found this junk rather hokey that's the purpose behind it i suppose cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this and unbearable the snowball offspring is an obvious homage to gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort the weapon against them bananas it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film both fell in a truck bed full of anti freeze an icicle emerging from jack's belly was penetrating sam's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed and i guess in their being being linked by the icicle jack inherited sam's banana allergy or so this is what we are led to believe and in doing so both merged in a sense br br phew such a film as this defies simple explanation it's a film with effects and plot so terrible one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many failings
<START> remember greg the bunny it was this show that started on the independent film channel but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox my cousin and i thought it was pretty funny beyond the precocious idea of puppets taking on tv pg material puppets who kill occurs in a similar universe where puppets live in the same world as people and like us take on jobs and lives of their own let's just say if you couldn't handle that then don't bother watching as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who fell out of society's good graces through drug abuse hedonism and violent felonies only to end up in a half way house there's plenty of violence sex and bad language so it would never make its way to u s network tv as if sociopathic puppets weren't enough the fact that this takes place in canada makes it even more disturbing btw the government pays for this and i think any american television viewer would demand more demented cable tv fodder like this i don't know where you can get it in the u s beyond extra satellite tv but i'd advise you give it a try really funny stuff it airs on the comedy network in canada
<START> this is one of the worst anime series i have ever seen when i watched the manga review in a magazine i thought it was maybe interesting but when i got the chapters i realized it was a complete stupidity br br ok the first 2 or 3 chapters are ok and the series have an standard but as the plot advances it becomes totally incoherent the series tries to show some mystical based upon the christian mythologies but it's a total stupidity it features some demons and stigmata scenes totally nonsense it seems the series tries to seem deeply thought complex or reviewed but a watcher with a bit of brain and cultural references will realize soon all those elements used don't have a real sense they are put there only to impress the ignorant watchers br br the final chapters are full of totally nonsense elements battles with cat eared demons references to a supposed fight between demons and demons who controls time with no apparent reason the final is totally nonsense an ignorant watcher will see on it a floating final that gives them a place to meditate but the truth is this the final and the complete series is a total incoherent and incongruent nonsense
<START> down periscope has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs since then we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now br br it is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered br br the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession even among the very young i became aware of this while visiting the uss drum in mobile alabama in 2002 a group of cub scouts my grandson among them had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board br br it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood which is rare company br br thanks to kelsey grammar lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie such great entertainment
<START> this is one of the great ones it works so beautifully that you hardly notice the miscasting of then 37 year old dana andrews as the drugstore soda jerk who goes to war and comes back four years later when he would have been at most 25 but then who else should have played him
