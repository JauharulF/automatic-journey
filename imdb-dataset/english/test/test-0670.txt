<START> the writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes br br example when dave retrieved his keyboard from the rain i was eagerly anticipating the funny sounds that were going to come out of it nothing are you kidding me a truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely soaked but then work perfectly br br there were at least 10 other similar situations overall small children will enjoy this parents will endure it without too much complaining
<START> i have always liked bill murray in films like lost in translation and the trailer for this film looked really good but the result was very disappointing basically murray plays jack who has recently found out that his father died and he is expected to hear his will he finds out that his father was a clown because he left a large shoe his squeaky nose and his main inheritance an elephant the only way that jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and give him to a safe zoo for 30 000 also starring pat hingle as vernon there are small tiny moments of humour such as a truck's front bending forward and murray screaming but overall it's pointless pretty poor
<START> we see thomas edison with a glowing smile on his face trying to electrocute a 5 ton living being eventually he was successful and so the first animal snuff film is born cleverly disguised as an amazing achievement in technology this is scientific arrogance at it's worst folks it ranks up there with the doctor who decapitated a monkey just to prove that he could keep its severed head alive for 22 minutes br br oh yes there's the absurd excuse that the elephant had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death and that this was a fair and humane execution to all the people who are satisfied with this sophistry please form a line on my right i'm going to give you all a big collective three stooges slap across the head br br go watch the advocate 1993 a movie based on the true story murder trial of a pig in france 500 years later humans are still a bunch of morons i see br br what's next we arrest birds for stealing our arrest bushes for assault and battery thomas edison i hope you have a big fat worm crawling through your eye socket right now oh wait that would be trespassing wouldn't it lol
<START> it is very hard to come up with new information about jfk jr and this fine movie had very little of it but it was a joy to watch the casting was very good and the script while somewhat like a documentary was also good my only complaint was that it wasn't long enough perhaps a two part movie could have told us more about his pre george days and his relationships with his mother sister and other relatives some of the material in the book american son by richard blow would have enhanced the movie a lot should be applauded for producing such an entertaining movie
<START> the most obvious flaw horrible horrible script this movie had a potentially good story but it was ruined with bad dialogue continuity problems things that were never explained gaping plotholes sub plots that went nowhere and just plain stupidity not to mention the awful cliched directing of sandra locke not even two great performances could've saved this movie so it didn't matter that devon and rosanna arquette give horrific performances the thing is they're better actors than this movie would have you believe the best of the rosanna arquette silverado after hours desperately seeking susan has some fine moments like a great scene in the beginning when she painfully pulls her handcuffs off but gives an overall weak performance by her standards and devon dick when trumpets fade and the brilliant my so called life is much worse acting with no conviction or emotion what so ever but i won't lay blame on the actors who have been good in other roles the script is awful and the bad direction doesn't help do me a favor avoid this movie
<START> this movie beats everything out there well depends on what you are looking for it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale this movie is in a complete league of its own i don't think any movie could possibly come close to it i am not sure what the director intended to make it as a thriller or a comedy if he did think he was making a thriller then he has by a stroke of luck created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time you have to see it to believe it a matrix terminator a host of other movies rolled into one along with a storyline dating back to 1980's hindi movies with a a mythical snake which can turn into a human br br its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side planning to laugh at the movie i am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10 on the basis of flipping a coin i have decided to give it a 1
<START> what can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster not that much with the average indie style film making this film has the timing all wrong editing is just awful as far as the gangster story it might have been pulled off if the gangsters didn't lack character everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of punch line none of which were funny the usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold the dying mafia father that wishes his son would make his business legit the best friend with the zany one liners but the main character the gangster that likes to dress up like a girl only his motivation for dressing up like a girl is that he got mugged by a woman weird the ending of the movie had to be the nail in the coffin it was anti climatic to say the least i mean i understand how indie filmmakers don't have the equipment for a proper shot out but they might as well been using water guns overall i would say the hype leading up to it red carpet premiere in vancouver it was a disappointment
<START> i am from romania and for that i apologize if my english is not so good br br i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed i always liked wesley snipes's movies but this one is terrible i regret that i spent over 3 hours downloading this film there are a lot mistakes in the film for example the stadium in the film is not lia the name of the stadium is the name of the soccer team is called not uli the of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images video replays live images etc it's a simple that can only display letters and numbers the uli team's opponents are displayed on the as din probably from who are main rivals in the romanian soccer championship the images from the soccer match are from a match between and poli my favorite team and my only love look it up on the internet and you will see why the police cars in the movie are not properly made there isn't a single dark blue police car in romania they are all white the mistake list can go on and on and on but i will stop here in short terms this movie is horrible it does not worth renting it it does not worth buying a cinema ticket for it it does not worth downloading it i honestly feel sorry that wesley snipes played in this movie a previous movie of his 7 seconds also filmed in romania was ok but this is terrible
<START> i am finding that i get less and less excited about disney's sequels to movies yes i do understand that the budget for the direct to video movies are not the same but these movies don't even try some examples are hunchback ii and tarzan and jane if anyone has seen the previews for stitch the movie you will see my point but i digress this movie reaffirms my point the animation is sloppy the story lines resemble saturday morning cartoons and not all of the original voices are there i was very disappointed not to hear michael j fox's voice it was so glaringly obvious that the person doing milo's voice was trying to sound like fox but didn't come close to succeeding br br if it says anything my children ages 10 and 6 didn't even sit through the whole movie
<START> although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it's intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters br br this won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether br br this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it's over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this film at every turn
<START> terrific deeply moving crime thriller starring andy lau and lau ching wan br br from the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion this cat and hardly misses a beat br br johnny to again working with ace composer arthur wong constructs another operatic actioner that in the face of its contemporaries br br to's images are strong and moving his cutting combined with the extraordinary music cues is exemplary you are in the hands of a master br br the two sequences in which andy lau hides from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty ruby wong are testament to to's unique directorial skills br br lau ching wan is strong and commanding as the harassed cop while andy lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father's death br br this is superb movie making only mildly compromised by some bad english dubbing in one scene with criminal lee
<START> kate is a jaded young woman who has trouble meeting and dating guys throughout the movie you get to meet several of her loser boyfriends and throughout the movie you are subjected to kate's cynical negative outlook on love and relationships this negative viewpoint is continued throughout and presented as ultimate truth i had a real problem with this why would anyone want to be taught about love life and dating from someone who is obviously so messed up it would work if that was the joke but it is not for the jokes in the movie which are neither funny nor original to work at all you have to believe what kate is saying that all relationships inevitably end up with bad or no sex that the highest level a relationship can evolve to is when you are able to fart in front of your partner you get the idea br br there is no movie in recent memory that comes close to upsetting the stomach as much as love sex why did the filmmakers waste their time on such trash every joke in love sex is something that i have experienced in another movie or in my own life there is nothing original or creative about the story the production or the style it is cynical dumb and pointless mind numbing
<START> i loved this movie from beginning to end i am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love skateboarding drawing but my friends were always there for me music was like my rehab life support and my drug it changed my life i can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say this movie left me speechless to be honest i just saw it on the ifc channel i usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellite the ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movie im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the don't do a very good job on translating lines i mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess i almost never got to see this amazing movie good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed well earlier than usual lol i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did i wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film i give it three thumbs way up br br this movie blew me away
<START> i have just seen a very original film that i would recommend to everyone including the young the restless ' however i guess some of the profanity violence and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for all your children ' anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass let me tell you the name of the film nurse betty ' renee zellweger stars as betty she is a kansas waitress who falls under a trance and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera because of this she goes on a journey to los angeles to reunite with her supposed soap opera character lover dr rubell to add fuel to the fire she is also being chased by some ruthless one life not to live' who think she has stolen their drugs you could say that is how nurse betty spends the days of her life' throughout the movie this very situation eventually leads her to the set of her beloved soap opera however the only problem is that betty thinks this is all real it is like her mind is in another world ' ok enough i will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names i have already registered my vote for renee as a best actress oscar nominee also greg kinnear's performance as dr rubell was as good as it gets in his acting biography to sum it up my final diagnosis is that everyone should call in for nurse betty ' excellent
<START> this one's a doozy dating from 1949 scene of the crime often plays more like a coen bros movie set in the 1940's and filmed in black and white except that the writer's ear for pastiche here isn't quite so well tuned maybe this can be seen instead as the forerunner to oscar baiting schlock like road to perdition frankly it's a wonder that this film isn't considered a classic by film professors and critics everywhere considering how much it offers in term of overly articulated thrills cloaked in false significance much like the grandaddy of all such fake art films citizen kane or anything by murnau br br mgm is usually a studio that can do no wrong in my eyes and i think any story any atmosphere even gritty realism can only benefit from grotesque you could say i'm a disciple of the minnelli school but it takes a certain light touch to write mannered tough guy dialogue of the dashiell hammett stripe a willingness perhaps to let maybe one or two scenes pass without a line like careful mr wiggly or you'll have thirteen fish to fry and no little to catch them with i made most of that up mr wiggly unfortunately made the cut but believe me the dialogue is just that inflated and riddled with non sequiturs even the lead cop's wife played by arlene dahl speaks like she has a moon shaped scar under one eye and the christian name rocco by the time van johnson turns in his badge with the line i'm sick to death of death and homicide you'll wonder how the writer's fixation with ornate literary devices in this case could ever have been misconstrued as street br br for those who have outgrown the naked gun series this is the funniest cops n robbers film going
