<START> i watched all three segments and am so disappointed in the story line spends so much time mimicking duvall he does nothing else in the show and tommy lee jones would never be so weak as a young man unlikeable yes but weak never we never see how or why they go to back to lonesome dove which is a dirt hole in the original why would they ever leave austin where they are hero's for doing nothing during the whole movie i was rooting for blue duck by the end of the movie and he was totally miscast there is no warning about how many segments there are it just ends this mini series could have been somebody tragic it looked like it was directed by the parrot and the jag
<START> how does david lynch do it unlike the legions of thick black framed glasses wearing types and pretentious movie critics who praise his name i just don't see how this guy keeps getting paid to make such tripe how can lynch sloppily together leftover footage from a failed tv pilot into a nonsensical poorly acted mess have critics rave about it actually include it on year's best lists br br i'm baffled if you're looking for a good film noir rent bound instead if you're looking for a good puzzle movie try memento but beware of this over hyped stinker unless your idea of a fun night is throwing away 2 1 2 hours of your life 3 50 of your hard earned cash
<START> i had no expectations when seeing the movie because i was seeing it with a bunch of friends and had no idea what it was some parts were silly and some parts were lame but overall the movie was worth watching i like goth looking women this movie has plenty of it the fangs do look really lame though
<START> i say remember where and when you saw this show because i believe if fox gives talk show a chance spike will be right up there with conan in a few years because like conan he is incredibly funny and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor br br the funniest bits spike has had so far are the idiot and comedy for stoners and if your not high and get what does that say about you br br in summary this show is funnier in 25 minutes than snl in an hour so lets hope talk show gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour more money and a band
<START> i watched this last night on sundance altman must be the most hit or miss director of note ever this show despite its star power is utterly non compelling and its political insights which i as a proud liberal in no way disagree with are shallow and clunky and seem ripped from the headlines of usa today despite the fact it's coming out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as mario the drama as such is not very dramatic and the comedy is not funny the only points of interest really are seeing how new yorkers live their lives and the loyalty of a cast and crew to a show that keeps insisting has some cult following from 1988 sometimes it seems like altman's sole contribution to cinema has been the art of having all your actors talk at once the effect of which is one feels depressingly like they're a stranger at a wedding
<START> this trash version of romeo and juliet' passes in manhattan in the present days romeo will keenan is an a hole and violent member of family que and juliet jane jensen is a sexy with beautiful legs and breasts and bisexual girl of capulet family the scatological situations this romantic pair will face are very funny although being a cult movie inclusive exhibited in rio de janeiro festival it is not recommended for all the audiences if the viewer is fan of peter jackson's former movies bad taste' toxic avenger' body melt' and other trash movie he will certainly love this flick otherwise he will hate it since i belong to the first group my vote is eight br br
<START> cheaply pieced together of recycled film footage music and ideas this film cannot really be called well but for me when i watched it as a teenager it was quite amusing i didn't know battle beyond the stars before in retrospect it has got something nostalgic regarding the sf wave of the early eighties and the special effects of this time its trashy old fashioned look and its naivety provide a certain attraction to enjoy this movie i recommend to concentrate on the paternal relationship between the characters of vince edwards and david mendenhall in addition i liked the idea that a bunch of scoundrels discovers its heroic qualities after been unwillingly confronted with the challenge to take care of a child
<START> my architect is a great film about nathaniel kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous architect father louis kahn dead since 1974 the film builds slowly but perfectly and what starts out as a seemingly lost identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love loss family and perhaps more importantly our life's work br br i had never heard of louis kahn prior to this film although i was vaguely familiar with some of his work through the words both good and bad of louis kahn's colleagues you get a very good sense of what nathaniel must have felt as memories are recalled and stories retold sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling nathaniel how to feel about his father as i listened to each recollection my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible sometimes in the span of a moment so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that emotions must have been riding br br the final sequence in bangladesh totally made the film for me the reverence of which the people of bangladesh spoke of louis kahn's work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me and hopefully for nathaniel br br i think nathaniel kahn finally found what he was looking for
<START> plot br br a chair from ebay br br random people br br random people talk dude it's right i'm feeling it lets get married now br br if you are a hippie then you will love this movie you must be high or drunk otherwise you will question your life watching this junk br br this movie was clearly not thought out from the beginning to the end and the other comments are probably the crew padding the reviews if this wasn't aimed at my demographic i don't know what it is aimed for i found the plot everyday boring it's something that i would do and trust me it's not worth filming going on a roadtrip and filming half of the silence does not make a movie
<START> the fact that a film is on dvd doesn't guarantee that its quality is very good the fact that a film's quality is threadbare doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it this review actually applies to 2 films paired on a single dvd br br the plots of these films are of little consequence they are of interest only to people who collect holmes films Â anybody who merely wants a few of the better offerings would do well to purchase some of those made by jeremy brett Â or in a pinch basil rathbone there are a few other very good holmes films featuring good actors on a one shot basis Â such as seven per cent solution or private life of sherlock holmes in any event these films are considerably less estimable br br here we have a pair of films featuring some of the best actors to do holmes even if the results tend toward disappointing this appears to be the only disc with these films on it although deadly necklace appears by itself in the same version on other discs br br sherlock holmes and the deadly necklace dates from 1962 although it neither looks it nor sounds it some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by hammer studios not that hammer hasn't turned out some really schlock stuff but where christopher lee was concerned they usually did a better job the print a direct transfer from a rather worn 1 1 33 copy in black and white the quality of the color suggests the original may have been in color and the snipped ends of the film's aspect suggest it may originally have been 1 1 66 or more br br the film is set in the early 20th century Â not improbable since holmes was still working then and didn't actually die until 1957 however the script is not adapted from any actual doyle story it involves an egyptian necklace and professor moriarty shows up as a world famous archaeologist as well as the prince of crime the plot is melodramatic and banal br br the biggest defect of this film is that Â for whatever unfathomable reason Â hammer filmed it in germany it was nonetheless filmed in english it was then dubbed in german and then re dubbed in english so what you hear isn't lee nor any of the other original actors but a bunch of unknowns Â not that outside of lee i doubt anyone would know any of the other actors this is too bad since lee see his hound of the baskervilles makes a quite decent holmes as it is his voice double is condescending and plain as bread pudding with no nor cinnamon br br the music for this film is primarily jazzy in a possible attempt to be period too bad nobody thought of ragtime as it is the music doesn't relate to what's happening on the screen and often is at odds with the action br br the other film is sherlock holmes and the speckled band from 1931 starring a young raymond massey the quality of the picture and sound is fully up to that of the 1962 effort and in fact a bit better massey makes a quite respectable holmes although he certainly doesn't own the in the way rathbone did and brett does the other thespians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers the acting Â as is true of many films of this period Â owes a lot to the post victorian stage and to silent films br br it should be noted that while the deadly necklace is available on dvd by itself the speckled band is available only with the former film br br there is very little else to be said of this film the settings seem to be an odd combination of the 1890s horse drawn carriages and the 1920s electronic devices such as a primitive taken altogether it's an interesting curio and a sufficient to buy the dvd with the pairing rather than a dvd with deadly necklace only
<START> when i first saw colleen moore it was in the excellent series about silent films called hollywood there she was in 1980 her hair defiantly bobbed as it was in the twenties a sparkling witty and charismatic elderly lady the very definition of presence then i saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like ella cinders and orchids and ermine then the disappointingly sombre talkie the scarlet letter and now here she is in the power and the glory giving a performance of staggering power working expertly alongside one of the talking cinema's finest actors spencer tracy br br i found the movie a little lack lustre story wise but moore and tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film and this is done mostly through acting alone with minimal make up and hair changes moore is almost unrecognisable as the elderly wife and the scene where she finds out her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently performed scenes i have ever seen she does most of the scene without dialogue which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge even over tracy contrast this with her delightful comic playing in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and tracy is struggling to propose to her astonishing what this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through its fingers and spend most of her life in retirement
<START> after visiting the museum in forth worth texas usa enjoying the art and the architecture also of the adjacent modern art museum and having a delightful conversation with the knowledgeable bookstore lady i purchased this a dvd with rather high and was not disappointed in the least br br the thematic approach dramatic tension revealing interviews archival footage and stunning architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic louis i khan br br the documentary begins contemplative classical music plays archives are scanned with a reflective shadowy face superimposed blurring letters symbolically referencing a train window passing a backdrop landscape Â a journey Â focus and out of focus the search eventually culminates to an article in a newspaper khan reads from the front page of the new york times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best american architect alive and his death announced br br when i first read that obituary i have to admit i was looking for my own name i was his child too his only son i didn't know my father very well he never married my mother and he never lived with us Â he died when i was eleven br br so years later this illegitimate son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure but who's secretive personal life escapes him and affects him to the point where he intends to do something about it br br for years i struggled to be satisfied with the little pieces of my father's life i've been allowed to see but it wasn't enough i needed to know him i needed to find out who he really was so i set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever there was left of him out there it would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions br br so the documentary is two fold by a slow systematic discovery of the world renown architect we get to know 1 his ideas buildings and the architectural perspective and 2 his families coworkers people's life he affected and the human perspective br br the dvd also offers added insight with a q a with the writer director and additional footage that includes such great louis i khan quotes as everything that everybody says is the truth it's their truth it might not be factual and a good idea that doesn't happen is no idea at all br br this movie is a journey of discovery self discovery and discovery of a man a great man yet a human imperfect like all of us we get to know him through the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter son but with the openness and objectivity to really explore without making easy conclusions and without judging br br by key interviews with people who interacted with him in various capacity we slowly put some pieces together until that final interview with this man from bangladesh who really seems to bring it back home with visceral and sensible comments br br brilliant architect brilliant documentary
<START> i just finished this movie and my only comment is oh wow jennifer beals is ok as the fiancee but yancy butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite having watched her in witchblade i was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screen br br i gotta see this movie again if only for yancy butler as
<START> although i enjoy steve carrell's work evan the almighty like so many other overdone films turned out to be a lot worse than i hoped it would be br br this turned out to be a cheesy family movie the kind that employ famous comedian to improve their image but ultimately fail to deliver br br the usual carell's dorky humour is almost absent from the movie and though he did make me chuckle a few times there was nothing hilarious about him in evan the almighty br br his 3 kids although were probably somehow important for a biblical character were really quite useless in the movie and terrible actors even his wife was somewhat of a third leg for such a simple storyline br br spending so much money on making a comedy was a huge mistake although carell's career might profit from this movie there's no real reason to go see it br br if only there was a little less of his family a little more of carell molly shannon and maybe some other snl cast it could have actually been a lot more entertaining br br 4 10 for a few chuckles here and there
<START> to paraphrase the previous reviewer's comments if you're a stooges fan avoid this one at all costs my basic question is being the experienced troopers of comedy that moe and larry were why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio columbia was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors this movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard moe and larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant joe de rita despite his background in vaudeville is just not up to the job as a replacement for curly shemp or even joe besser if that's who moe and larry had left to pick from they should have just closed up shop and enjoy their retirement years leaving us fans with better memories of far better films they had done earlier always leave them laughing is the motto for comedy and always quit while you're on top hence seinfeld's leaving the sitcom while right up there instead of sticking around for the inevitable decline
