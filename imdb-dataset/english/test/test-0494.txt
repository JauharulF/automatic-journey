<START> this morning i found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed i found myself thinking oh yeah there was a mr magoo movie wasn't there this is more surprising because i remember following the controversy surrounding this movie advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning i even went to see this movie on the day it opened because i am a fan of both mr magoo and mr nielson and thought he would be an excellent choice to play mr magoo i even remember the opening animated credits because i thought that they were pretty amusing br br after that though its all a complete blank i think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame so bland and so utterly without merit that you can't remember anything from it i understand that leslie nielson isn't always known for appearing in first class comedies but i saw him in spy hard in scary movie 4 and police squad 3 and none of these were great movies but i came away at least remembering something mr magoo though is a complete blank br br i find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie
<START> this might not have been as horribly bad as it was if not for the absolutely awful acting job done by raymond wallace this guy is so bad it wasn't even funny his character was needed in the film but why they chose this guy is beyond me br br if you're looking for some quality chinese films might i suggest raise the red lantern the story of ju red sorghum br br anything but this i was surprised at how many people actually rated this highly really the acting by this wallace loser is so bad it overshadows the other good parts of this film this was agreed upon by all 6 of us watching this movie last night br br stay clear of this piece of garbage
<START> you know i'm sure the boys were sitting around the office one day and said how can we make more money they had made every possible variant of toy they could make with their current characters so they decide let's steal the star wars idea a prequel and we can make up all new characters and sell them as toys something they did in puppet master 3 but who cares anyway they pick a point in time before the first movie when toulon is still alive he and the puppets are sitting around and a wooden head roll on the floor and the puppets want to know if that is a dead family member or something it doesn't matter so the tale of the puppet master ancestry begins it's long it's boring no body cares br br the funniest part is they tell the origin of these new characters in the movie but give no clues of their fate so guess what once the revenue from the new toys pays off they can new and 4th straight rotten sequel called puppet master 8 the sequel to the prequel of the fate of the dead retro puppets hold your breath
<START> this movie is so good i first seen it when i was six then i bought it recently and i still love it im 15 now plus the acting was great and madonna is my idol and she did a phat job alot of people didnt like this movie and i still to this day dont understand why
<START> this film makes several nods to various science fiction films the prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of thx 1138 the trailer for buck rogers here it was clips from some early japanese sf tv show then the opening shot of the city in has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard reminding one immediately of bladerunner the bladerunner aspect comes even br br more pronounced when we meet the hero who is called a replicant he is blond haired and is called ryo a homage to roy batty rutger character in bladerunner a battle scene soon ensues which reminds one immediately of the matrix the government forcing the population to take drugs is like thx 1138 and the chief enforcer while looks like a cross between elvis and dan ackroyd turns out to be a robot very much like the terminator the end battle reminds one of terminator 2 and the end result is hilarious probably not one of the best sf films out there but is enjoyable certainly a lot more enjoyable than tripe like battlefield earth
<START> the only reason i'm even giving this movie a 4 is because it was made in to an episode of mystery science theater 3000 the horrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters complete inability to act the lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows no chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost don't care what happens to him dick sargent was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was suppose to be super evil he was more annoying then anything peter graves was the only person the movie that wasn't awful his part was small and even he couldn't compensate for his co stars lack of talent in 2004 someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called the island i personally didn't see that movie but from what i understand its the same movie if you want to laugh at this movie get the mst3k episode its really funny full of bewitched and biography references it makes this movie finally watchable
<START> but at the same time part of you is thinking am i ready for what i am about to see br br in the end you are happy you saw it i was at least jackass number two has twice the laughs and twice the action some stunts will leave you breathless besides little miss sunshine i think it was the best movie i saw this summer maybe even this year br br the entire cast returns besides a few such as chris and rake i don't think any of the cast members had a dull moment each and every stunt was either funny or dangerous or a combination of both stupid the beginning was just as funny as the first one and the ending was interestingly hilarious the cast performing a musical number br br jackass number two is the perfect movie to see with your friends stay during the credits there are some pretty funny moments one involves luke wilson
<START> this movie is hilarious i would say much more painful disgusting than the previous movie the entire cast from the previous movie series is present br br these kind of movies are great to watch in the cause the whole audience is crying with laughter especially at the terrorist part that was damn disgusting i wish they made more of these kind of movies br br strong stomach required they got some insane stunts this time around warning includes a lot of snakes i would love to write about it but i just can't spoil the fun go see it
<START> any film school student could made a film 1 000 times better than piece of garbage as someone who had read the book i expected even a straight re telling of the book would make this a fair film there was a chance that a talented director could go beyond narrative and make a great film br br well the director did go beyond narrative he added a hip hispanic angel named that was not in the book he had bob woodward interview the dead belushi in an exchange in the morgue the film had all the insight of someone stoned on pcp staring at his navel br br if this is a spoiler to you you will thank me for it because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made
<START> the best romantic comedy i've seen in years not the kind of slick over the top hollywood stuff by ben stiller or adam sandler and a lot less syrupy than a hugh grant epic julianne nicholson and jay mohr are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time their sexual oats before marriage instead of playing it strictly for laughs the writers and director concocted a nice blend of human feelings and comedic action nicholson is just great as the awkward seductress and mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters into the game but soon finds himself enjoying his flings a little too much we see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without distracting from the main story andy richter earnest friend and helen slater distraught single mom are particularly good there is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this a lot more than a standard boy girl farce indeed with just a little better pacing and a tiny bit more cutting this film would be a top ten comedy
<START> the man who gave us splash cocoon and parenthood gave us this incoherent muddle of cliched characters poor plotting you've got to be kidding dialogue and melodramatic acting i guess everybody has a bad day at the office now and then he's allowed
<START> i've seen this story before but my kids haven't boy with troubled past joins military faces his past falls in love and becomes a man the mentor this time is played perfectly by kevin costner an ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives after losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes the young troubled recruit is played by kutcher while his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter he compliments costner well i never really understood ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs but her presence on screen is a pleasure the two stars of this movie are the coast guard and the sea both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie the movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships but it still works the rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact this movie earns the audience applause and the applause of my two sons
<START> a truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life it could be set in any town in the uk br br i live in a housing estate in glasgow and can relate to this film very well br br sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable br br the actors are scarily believable i felt as if i was spying on my neighbours it was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people i was very moved by a few scenes br br i loved the way this film was shot br br overall this film is a must see
<START> but unfortunately no one thought about having van killed in order to save this doomed production the only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voice too bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy why did i hate van so much well throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third rate soupy sales imitation with lots of mugging bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh the worst of these moments was when he was teaching the class these kids laughed at everything he did heck van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed now van was not the only bad casting decision in the film he was just the most obvious of course having john gielgud a lovely actor play an asian was ridiculous as well as having michael york play peter finch's brother the bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices the film was doomed from the start and the worst of them was the god awful bobby van now in real life he might have been a lovely person and it's sad that in real life he died so young but with the material they gave him here i just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quiet br br now i also mentioned the songs those terrible songs the original lost horizon by frank capra was a subtle delight throughout and not a single song and dance number in the film so why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film they only served to make it seem like a gooey mess like the original doctor doolittle combined with lost horizon the end result is a sickly sweet children's movie not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8 br br now if you can remove these problems you have the basis of a decent film after all the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo peter finch is particularly good though certainly not the equal of ronald colman in the original but considering that the original was a near perfect classic why bother with this sticky confection who wants to wade through the treacle br br by the way this film was included in the 50 worst films book by harry medved while i too disliked the film it wasn't bad enough to merit inclusion in the book i think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared an excellent book just not one of the best selections to the hallowed hall of dreck
<START> as a non theist im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago safe to say science is based on evidence religion is based on blind faith nuff said there then br br the film was produced by the bbc and to be honest it could quite easily have been shown on television while the acting is superb the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release that said if it reaches a wider audience this way then so be it but i have seen many period style dramas on bbc tv and they were well up to the finished standard of this just don't expect too much of a big budget thrill ride when going to see it br br in some ways i found the movie almost going out on a limb to apologise to religious fundamentalists while it attains a good sense of tension the whole way through i couldn't help wanting it to get to the publication of the origin of species much quicker than it actually did you'll wait right until the end for that and it seemed to dwell much more than i was ever aware on darwin's struggle with himself and his wife emma portraying him almost as some kind of insane lunatic at times which is hardly true there are many other errors and facts missing in relation to the real story of the lead up to the publication of origin too but the whole premise of the movie focuses almost entirely on the difficulty darwin faced domestically with the book and a small portion on the death of his beloved daughter annie this gives the film its most moving scene where annie passes away as she asks one final time to hear darwin tell her the story of a captive orangutan which died of pneumonia though you'll probably feel a bigger connection with the primate in that scene than with darwin's daughter br br with the early controversy apparently surrounding the movie in the usa it will work well to promote it and ensure many more people will get to see it but to be honest there is actually very little in it that insults any mythical its hardly headline news about a theory that has been around 150 years after all but as fundamental christians and many other religions which we're all well aware of like to wave a placard or two whenever possible i guess this movie is as good excuse as any personally i cant see what all the fuss is about but maybe they're just around
