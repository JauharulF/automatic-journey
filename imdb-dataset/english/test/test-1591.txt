<START> i'll not comment a lot what's to stereotype characters absolute ignorance about reality awful mise en scene poor color choice not funny it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some music it's beside the nonsense scenes very poor actors direction if you see somewhere those people i mean the interpreters you'll know they are at least good but seeing this so call film it is impossible to guess it you get tired of the music this comedy has no rhythm the only good rhythm in it it's the rap sing in the final credits pathetic doesn't it etc etc it has been a long time i haven't seen a movie so bad
<START> i thought this was movie was great richard greico and yasmine bleeth have great chemistry in this movie yasmine character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with richard greico's character they end up getting married and everything seems perfect except yasmine bleeth wants a baby more than anything however she has a hard time trying to conceive richard greico will do anything to make her happy and will go to extreme measures to make her happy i thought the acting was great in this movie and it keeps you guessing it shows how naive one can be when they have fallen in love yasmine bleeth is a good actress in this and i wonder why she never made it further in her career richard greico is very impressive as the deceiving husband and plays the evil part very well i wonder why certain actors make it and certain ones don't all and all a great movie that i would recommend
<START> they did it again ripped off an old show's title then destroyed the nostalgia with boring re imagined stuff the '60's cartoon was one of the funniest of its time a good natured satire of super hero comic books the character was drawn as 1 2 way between animal and human the way mickey mouse is here they use a real that's about the same as making a mickey mouse watch with a real rat br br most of the clever schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this film instead we get a clumsy ex police dog who's even dumber than cad and some pet owners who add nothing to the story cheesy effects the dog talking animation is embarrassing poor scripting a stereotyped dwarf playing simon bar sinister the gravelly noise box guy they hired to voice underdog is painful you'd think they'd at least gotten a voice impressionist to approximate wally cox's humorously distinctive voice for underdog but no there are at least a few affectionate references to the source material such as the rhyming lines which lift it to a 4 br br only small children that love dogs may enjoy this everybody else should get a dvd of the original cartoon series watch this only in desperation
<START> i really don't think it's necessary that i write a review on a movie with a title as derisory as snake island but even in the abstract confines of its own genre this hit a new low so my anger must be known the only reason why i even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because i knew it was going to be bad it was really late at night i could not sleep and in the past really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for slumber it became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful but it condescended below even those expectations br br the movie was directed and written by wayne crawford who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the african river who ends up having to strand his team on a remote island called snake island until another boat comes down to pick them up they hang out get drunk and then become subject to the onslaught of poisonous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island of human beings br br if your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph don't bother to reread it you got it right the first time frankly i prefer my creature features when the creature s just attack the dumb humans out of hunger not because they have some kind of a mission these aren't mutant snakes they're not giants like what you see in anaconda they're just ordinary everyday african snakes like and they have the brains to form armies take up causes work together to trap people understand our language and even dance did your draw drop again well it's going to drop further amount midway through this awful b movie about the part where i'd already given up the human characters start drinking around a campfire and then all of a sudden they break down into some kind of an orgy and while they dance nude and such the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start jamming along to it the combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes some the most roguish creatures on the planet have formed an alliance against human beings for some oddball reason proved just too much for my poor brain and just when i though the filmmakers couldn't take it to an even lower level the snakes started to sing br br the people in the movie well let's just say that never before have i rooted for the creatures to kill everybody off so quickly i just could not stand it any longer br br i really don't think i need to keep going on you get the picture if there is anything that makes snake island any different from its other rivals it's that it does dare to try to be even dumber and that's not a complimentary achievement continue to subject myself to these really bad movies i guess i'll never really know but snake island hits a brand new low it's a cheap trashy excuse for a motion picture that makes anaconda a brainless snake movie look as brilliant and sophisticated and thrilling as steven spielberg's jaws you have been warned
<START> in this tv special jon is the one who needs a life the highlight of his day is counting the on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer not content with this forever jon takes garfield to a self help group in order to meet people how many people will be interested in a loner 20 something who's best friend is a cat br br after several failed attempts at getting a girl including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals david fusion of flashdance and mc hammer in the office dead says jon he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself br br naturally they get on but garfield is worried that john will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat fortunately jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats br br with slicker animation than past tv specials this feels like a longer episode of garfield and friends
<START> my goodness and here i thought that there were no directors worse than uwe boll br br imagine the number of decisions necessary to produce a motion picture conceptual approval scriptwriting dialogue editing casting set and prop design location selection acting timing cinematography lighting music sound and video editing direction br br now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong br br result dracula 3000 br br for a film supposedly set in the this movie looks surprisingly like a cheap gangsta flick of the 1970's the set is ridiculous for the period the dialogue is atrocious the timing of each scene is ludicrous the acting is beyond abysmal everything stinks br br let's just take props for example if you have a movie set on a space freighter built in how likely is it that it will have the exposed piping and hydraulic doors of a 1960's era oil tanker what technology hasn't changed in 900 years the uses a standard tandy keyboard and radio shack to reprogram the computer what they haven't figured out voice control yet of course the prof is tethered to a wheelchair with wheels even though you know they've got intergalactic hyperdrive but apparently not even a motorized wheelchair much less a floating one or bionic legs or something and apparently this freighter was carrying an intergalactic of caskets how convenient then there are the weapons the crew carry standard late 20th century firearms in a ship in the vacuum of space where one would kill them all nice planning there prop department br br oh why go on
<START> this film could have been great but wasn't amongst the cesspool of talentless no hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent the main star of the film plays a good lead role he is convincing and has those scary italian eyes however he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across the opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing it looks like gay porno fortunately no one stripped off the rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish the prison sequence was the best part of the film although irrelevant the movies soundtrack if you can call it that sounds like a teenage boys first attempt at using and some sample cds it is boring repetitive and extremely lame in fact the whole film is lame get out while you still can
<START> the beauty the terror the poetry the horror the innocence the guilt br br maybe that's just about all i should write in this comment for a tale of two sisters the best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it i myself didn't even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when i went into this movie i just took a look at the nice cover art didn't even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into dvd player i only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended br br the dvd cover read the most frightening film since the ring the grudge and dark water though the frightening part might be right you can forget about the rest because the only thing a tale of two sisters has in common with those movie is a ghostly apparition with long black hair it's even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous japanese movies because this korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others br br this movie simply is a small masterpiece and here are some reasons without telling anything about the plot the movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprise twists and just when you think you've had the conclusion whether you get it or not that's irrelevant for the moment and you think the movie will end this movie goes on a bit longer the cinematography is amazing using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night the camera work is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive if not innovating angles some shots are pure poetry e g the top shot with the two sisters at the lake it all looks very stylish there are only four main characters but the intrigue surrounding them is intense the story itself starts a bit slow but there's a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting there was even one scene when the girls took off towards the lake that suddenly had me remembering peter jackson's heavenly creatures but when the horror kicks in it's quite effective there are also a few successful surprise scares in it damn i jumped right up from my sofa the musical score is great and at times when it's not supposed to be scary i couldn't help but noticing that it had sort of an italian feeling to it a bit strange for a korean movie but nevertheless a great score so much care went into every detail of this film including a perfectly balanced surround sound br br i also think that calling a tale of two sisters just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit it's more a mysterious horror drama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level no matter how you look at it this is asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest it might not be gory but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed so if you haven't seen it yet then find a copy pop it into your dvd player go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it's 110 minutes running time br br there i hope i did a good job praising it without spoiling anything
<START> the role of economics in the industrialized north american market must have always been theorized in the homelands of the engines creation persons and industrialist such as mercedes benz and the bavarian motor works bmw surely realized the opportunity of the north market with the purchase of fuel and number of automobiles purchased per household this type of economic phenomena sparked the concept of speed racer br br after the new constitution of japan the industrialization of the isolated island nation of japan must seek opportunity once again via economic with its global neighbors this also helped spark the economic opportunities in the european and north american market if not the global market br br speed is a young avid driver who without knowing any better is driven by his demanding father pops racer who has challenged himself his whole life to make a better machine better at winning races it was in fact pops racer who drove his first son rex racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how to best use the technology he developed as a mature racer rex finally realizes his own inherent values and becomes independent but still feels obligated to his younger bother speed br br the exact relationship of rex racer to persons such as the inspector are never really clear but put into dramatization rex is eventually accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization due to his ability to be in places at times when there is no other explanation to how he would have known speed was in trouble or the fact that the situations involved some types of illegal activity were his secretive knowledge is against an evil plot this brings a level of cloak and dagger romance to speed racer br br the mixture of speeds innocence with and chim chim brings a level of comic human nature this concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance the themes and plots as they are played out from episode to episode so instead of a dry detective story the thrill of international race car driving romance of cloak and dagger and comedy of human nature is put into one story speed racer
<START> like its near contemporaries the great race and those magnificent men in their flying machines i always associate this film with my childhood especially at new year on new year's day we'd visit my granny and after lunch while the adults talked the kids would watch tv where invariably one of these three crazy race films would be on br br for that reason alone i really wanted to mark monte carlo or bust well but i fear i can't the child not being father to the man on this occasion by which i mean i can see all too clearly its faults and while i was tempted to smile occasionally in truth i really wanted all the competitors to get to the end of the race long before they actually do br br of course it's dated by its stereotyping of nationalities and woman as the weaker sex and i also didn't much care for one or two stray admittedly mild vulgarities which occasionally surfaced more than that though the cast despite hamming it up outrageously just don't sell the film enough tony curtis in a trial run for his yank abroad turn in the tv series the seems too old to be playing the young gallant terry thomas just isn't dastardly enough eric sykes is unbelievable as a dirty minded lothario while gert frobe as an overdone teuton is just weird doing camp comedy when you remember he was bond's best villain goldfinger if anything the come off best susan hampshire is at least engaging as a bright young thing suitably gamine as a posh flapper and although chained to the leash of the script pete and dud offer the most amusement as stiff upper lip army types although even then the carry on team did this so much better in carry on up the pass br br director annakin tries everything to evoke the golden silents with lashings of slapstick mistaken identity capers speeded up camera shots would be dramatic stunts and some light romance but there's no real tension for such a famous race and anyway the race off at the end seems like another br br actually i'd have given it another mark if they'd stuck to the alternative title those magnificent men in their jaunty but in truth the animated series wacky races did this so much better
<START> i cannot argue with other comments that the story line focuses more on the romance between the mary martin and allan jones characters much in the manner of showboat than on the life of victor herbert but in the 1930's would that have been a box office draw instead of the life of vh perhaps it should have been the music of vh there is an abundance of this br br for me the thrill of the movie came near the end of the movie when susanna foster sings land of romance it has been over a decade since i caught this movie for a second time at a local 'old movies' theater at first the audience was stunned then it burst into spontaneous applause i remember the shivers running up and down my spine my trivia memory recalled the information provided to an inquiring public by a local journalist when the movie first came out back in the late 1930's 'that note hit by miss foster was a far f above high c ' br br she may not have had four octaves a la but the then teen ager certainly had a range
<START> i adore this film as much as any one adores viewing whatever it was they saw when they were young it was one of those films that home box office showed every other day throughout my youth this film is forever lodged in my brain for someone who didn't grow up around this film you may have become spoiled by the add cycle we've been in since the mid 90's and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem cool this is as my sis was doped up on better off dead before i saw this of which i raped loved and no one no one can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in american cinema in the 80's this gave birth to everything we have found tiresome in teen comedies because with all the overuse of slow mo the current soundtrack the new tech i wonder if cinema will go back to these roots this is the teen comedy yes
<START> i'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle in truth the acting isn't too bad and the story isn't as terrible as some made for disney movies have been the story itself is shallow and undeveloped but that isn't surprising in a film of this type the acting is more than a bit two dimensional but i give the actors credit for managing to do anything with the material that they had to work with br br however it's inexcusable in my book to base an entire storyline on the theory that they've created a 'perfect' pop star and then cast an actress who can't sing to save her life if the girl can't sing have someone who can record the music br br this actress is a terrible singer she was so flat she was usually singing in a totally different key
<START> i usually don't categorize a moving as boring i am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie in fact i enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line unfortunately this movie has none of those characteristics diane lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting none of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience i guess the scenes where the townspeople are marching somewhere were suppose to add to the story but it seems that they were inserted just to fill space the scenes appeared choppy and incoherent there were some nice shots of the ocean and the beach which were beautiful
<START> remember those terrible war movies your grandmother forced you to watch 25 or so years ago on your old vhs recorder the fallen is just a bad executed remake of those movies the story is terrible the direction is terrible the editing is terrible the music is terrible and all together make an unbearable nightmare br br it is also terribly slow very slow i tried to sleep while watching it but i couldn't do it because i had nightmares of it br br please don't watch this movie it is that bad ten lines is a lot so i don't know what else to say br br press the eject button now and you wont regret it
