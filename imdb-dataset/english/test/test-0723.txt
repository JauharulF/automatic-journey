<START> this movie is a cinematic collage of gangster clichÃ©s the writing is grade z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic it a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters think of bugs bunny cartoons and silly supporting characters the lady doctor and the writer there are much better bogart films out there in fact bogart looks like he slept through this performance he puts very little effort into this character i think the directorial advice he received was something like he's a bad guy act bad this guy is the era's equivalent of darth vader obvious evil and the anti hero don't waste your time with this one
<START> this was a dreadful boring movie even for a documentary at times it did provided insight to life and also had humorous moments but overall it was not worth seeing every time i began to feel sympathetic towards mark and began to hope he would be successful i would become disappointed by his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse
<START> i missed the beginning of the film i came in when the were in the farm house i can truthfully say that it was horrifying the moral ramifications are staggering br br my fear of pain and torture leave me unable to see myself other than cowardly i see the christ like ability that was depicted by the brave patriot and i can only pray that i could or would have the moral to follow his example br br i see that a main theme of the film is to show the weakness strength of the tortured but what a dismal decision to have to be confronted with all because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that pain and suffering being brought to bear on a fellow human being is in some way satisfying be it mental or physical br br i found the film very thought provoking
<START> as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family after coming to an arrangement with rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah eventually she accompanies her cousin a passionate leader of the brotherhood to ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named the o'hara the head of the family while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties she having been scorned by rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of fenton until rhett comes along in a clichÃ©d night on white horse type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fiancÃ© and scorned by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed br br i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision
<START> death wish 3 is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery all the characters apart from bronson's paul of course exist merely to be killed either as provocation the good guys or as retribution the villains the director simply pours on the mindless violence people even get burned alive and blown up turning this into an urban version of commando and charlie like arnold rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire fans of this short of thing and apparently there are many will enjoy it others beware 1 2
<START> i fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid this movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this here comes mr jordan 1941 and heaven can wait 1978 the only saving factor for figure skating fans might have been some nice ice skating done by a professional cast of skaters but this just does not happen the closest thing the audience sees to good skating is when tara character takes a turn on the ice for a just a moment others like nancy kerrigan and elvis are hidden in the background and do not do any figure skating at all there is not much real emotion shown and there is not really any reason to tune in to this obviously made for tv movie my advice rent the original
<START> i enjoyed this one because i can relate to it br br at one time in my life i was trying to make films and experienced many of the same problems mark did in trying to make his film and i also went through a protracted period of self absorbed arrested development where i refused to grow but then miraculously i got married and had kids i realized that being a struggling filmmaker was in all likelihood not going to feed my family so i got a decent job and did what i felt i needed to do to make that happen that is what an mature responsible adult does br br mark hasn't faced up to that reality as yet and so in that sense he is a retarded adolescent for this reason there is a hopelessness about him like don quixote he seems so inept and self deluded that he doesn't realize how bad off he really is the viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle mark has kids and an ex wife and bills to pay but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his artistic vision br br despite this mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends unfortunately mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career maturity responsibility education knowledge life experience financial clout etc yet he trudges on much like ed wood apparently without any semblance of a clue br br i guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the never say die attitude of this noble individual struggling against the odds and man what odds there are kiefer sutherland colin hanks tori spelling and angelina jolie are all offspring of big time film or tv people no doubt they will all want to direct some day if they aren't already how much room is there for an independent like mark it's like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board over and over again come to think of it that is pretty close to what happens to one of mark's actors with the kitchen cabinet door in one of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in any movie br br despite these misgivings and seeming criticisms i truly enjoyed this movie and would heartily recommend it to anyone uncle bill is amazing i have a friend who met both mike and mark and he told me that in real life these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie
<START> without actually giving away my age i saw this for the first time over 20 years ago when it first came out on video maybe it was a beta tape and i was old enough to drink barely and perhaps i had had a few because i remember thinking how great this movie was i have since seen it sober and have to admit it is a pretty bad film as mentioned in other posts the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the poor acting just makes it worse it's a poor attempt to fantasize that teenagers too can be mavericks although i am surprised to find out it actually was to be released the same time aprox as top gun and not actually meant to be a poor imitation but for all it's worth i do find myself watching it if it's on and i have the time it's one of those movies you watch because it's just so ridiculous and tries so desperately to take itself seriously like that other film moment by moment with john travolta and lily tomlin don't get me started on that one
<START> i never fell asleep during a movie never this movie did the impossible br br while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts this movie was a lesson in over abundance as in the movie was 30 minutes too long it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work but instead all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement the acting was absolutely terrible bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad lib something called a script did these people even get any direction were they coaxed to be boring and dull either wouldn't surprise me br br what was even worse was the rather unscary make up involved with the creatures from the other side either way they all stunk don't watch this film that's all i can say unless you're an insomniac
<START> i got to watch this one without commercial interruption and let me tell you even for a tv movie it was pretty predictable the actors did a workmanlike job with what they had and the cast was pretty accomplished barry bostwick jane seymour frances fisher etc however the script was not only predictable except for the last scene but the dialogue was treacly and sounded as if it was lifted from a third rate romance novel jane seymour's psychotic monologues were laughable i'm sorry but i find it hard to believe that anyone that creepy would arouse no suspicions whatsoever as bad as theresa russell was in black widow and she sure stunk it up she at least had the sense to play her pseudo characters somewhat straight seymour is a much better actress but didn't overcome the material here br br lastly the musical score is incredibly cheesy it's almost a satire of its genre like a kenny g meltdown a movie with such a lackluster and derivative script really should have gone for something edgier
<START> even though some unrealistic things happen at the end i e a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry go round where any number of innocent could be killed this still was an intense enjoyable thriller one of alfred hitchcock's better films robert walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times his co star in here farley granger is okay but is no match for walker either in acting or in the characters they play it's the typical hitchcock film with some strange camera angles immoral themes innocent man gets in trouble etc unlike a lot of his other films i thought this one was a fast moving story with a very few dull spots being an ex tennis player i enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies hitchcock's real life daughter patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here she didn't just get the job because of her dad she can act also of note the dvd has both the british and american versions and there were some differences in the story this is a classic film that is still referred to in modern day films even comedies such as throw momma off the train
<START> mystery science theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this gem br br this one is like a cheesy pirate copy of 80's porn you could have purchased on vhs from an arcade on 42nd st before disney bought the whole smash and closed them all down br br but wait all the sex scenes have been cut i challenge anyone to find a worse film this film could replace water boarding as a humane method of interrogation br br no i take that back i would prefer water boarding br br the only credit this movie could earn apart from being the worst movie ever made would be to threaten the middle east into solving its problems under pain of having to watch this movie
<START> don't worry no spoilers here just saying there is a very predictable plot a couple decide to live in his father's love nest so they can write a book article newsletter on his fling with a famous tragic hollywood starlet this whole production ran kind of like a high school troupe doing an episode of murder she wrote the only acting i was sold on was the old they interviewed for sources in the story apparently the directors thought the movie was getting too long so towards the end they stopped pointing their camera to a kind of creepy image of the starlet and brought in plot enhancers to wrap this thing up don't waste your time even the tried and true horror intrigue classics fail in this movie
<START> the great thing about thirst park's latest film is that it's the anti twilight some of you may take that as a minus but in reality it's a big plus park takes the method of vampirism seriously and as well the torrid love story between sang and tae we see the conflicts of both of the characters sang being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that unbeknownst to him turns him into a sickly but true blue vampire and tae with her mother and idiot brother the latter is killed by sang as in a very strong melodrama there's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point and the implications put forth from religion early on sang for example is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism even as he just can't be that and knows it on top of those about good vs evil push it up into another plane cinematically br br that thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that park has displayed with oldboy lady vengeance and the underrated i'm a cyborg but that's ok should be taken as a given thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric part romantic erotic part dramatic and lastly fantastical and it doesn't always treat as something of a simple horror movie set up though as a horror movie park has more than his share of scary scenes it's more akin to the movie near dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention and that the disease itself and its effect on a person's existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds you've seen em' all br br thirst also has a wicked sense of humor much like oldboy only here with a bite pun intended meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being an example of this can be found with the priest's predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor or the manner in which tae holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive even as she's had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood suckers who've brought pain and horror to her home but these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience what makes thirst last in the mind is how elements come together of drama and existential pains of a surreal sense of catholicism i especially loved the dynamic between sang and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood sucking but really wants to be a vampire too and of the erotic the scenes where the priest finally gives in to tae are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets not in a pornographic manner but in the sense of these characters' release and escape which doesn't last long over the scope of the story br br if it's not as great as oldboy it's not something to about not all films park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece and at the least he'll always be known as the man who directed that movie but is an excellent addition to his oeuvre and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general the film making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous and what a white room of the characters live in the humor is dark and hilarious the acting is intense and moody especially from subtle strokes from song kang ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from kim ok vin and the ending when it does finally get there is one of those truly superb vampire movie endings you'll be talking about for years in a good way in a battle between thirst and twilight thirst takes the knock out in the first round between let the right one in or near dark it's tougher to call 9 5 10
