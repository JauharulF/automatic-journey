<START> i gotta admit it i love horror films especially 80s slasher films hell i even love cheese like sleepaway camp and night of the demons but i didn't think much of this movie the death scenes weren't very well done the cgi was terrible and the acting was ho hum worst of all was the story which didn't make sense at all i'd say save your money but chances are if you want to see this movie you're going to anyway i didn't hate it it's just not very good overall it's just another bland lifeless horror film that lacks life it's no surprise that this one was on the shelf at dimension for over a year after it was completed
<START> i did not quite get o Â it is one of the weirdest ones i have watched the soundtrack was quite unusual as well Â written and performed by jean michel jarre it makes the movie weirder than it was i have to admit that i was almost going to change it and watch another one instead times the movie seemed plain dumb to me or boring Â or confusing there are quite a few sexual references in that movie Â trough they too are kind of messed up probably the only phrase that i will remember out of it is going to be when you are alone you can control things Â and i will show them or something like that the boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up Â the last summer as a child he thought once Â and he sure lived it to the max so if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie Â but you won't miss much if you don't
<START> this is a great show with total freshness and innovation that usual chair couch for a woman host that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes the same old jokes the same pattern copied from the days of probably the pattern of johnny carson copied by one and all leno conan daly this show does not seem to have any of these br br i fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and i am going to stick to it though it's too early to say that this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project and i hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest i hope that this show will last long br br returning back after months i still love this show and i love his self deprecating humor for example his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys which however does not involve the usual of conan o'brien for example i know it's a cardinal sin to be repelled by o'brien's antics but i do really dislike his style and repetitiveness br br i again watched it the other night with tom arnold in it spoof of trading spouses and nanny 911 in an earlier episode are hilarious idiot paparazzi are fun especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people's pictures and if i am not mistaken they start taking his pictures shouting gary coleman br br added on 16th april 2007 coming back once again i am left confused by the neighbor and her dog i cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing either way it was funny as hell br br i do not expect spike to read these pages but maybe he does he is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so i would better write down my suggestion here for him i would like him to do a full 30 minute show with crazy gideon the star of late night tv commercial i would like crazy gideon to have an interview in spike's talk show sing a song and play guitar do a skit in the line of snl and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential of los angeles i know crazy gideon may not be aware of this but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of la br br god willing br br returning back on 14th july 2007 someone wrote here that the people who praised spike's talkshow must be bribed by spike i confess that spike really bribed me but i must also confess that rockefeller named me in his will and last night i had sex with cindy
<START> i had never seen a film by john cassavetes up until two years ago when i first saw the killing of a chinese bookie in a berlin cinema which i found interesting to put it but not so special i instantly wanted to see more of his work since then i tried with an emphasis on tried watching his other work shadows in particular i must admit it took me a a while before i actually enjoyed the film at first the unpolished raw and improvised way cassavetes it was shot put me off somewhat and i thought of it as an original absolutely but flawed and dated experiment but now upon reviewing these little imperfections make it look so fresh even today br br shot on a minimal budget of 40 000 with a skeleton six person crew shadows offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an african american family in which two of the three siblings ben ben carruthers and lelia lelia goldoni are light skinned and able to pass for white cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing a reaction against hollywood production values cassavetes main inspiration at least in the cinematic style the film was shot were the italian neo realists whilst also professing admiration for welles' pioneering spirit the use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the italian neo realist directors but with his bebop score by charles ans shafi the film feels very different very american unlike anything made before really br br the song with the feathered girls i feel like a lolly pop or something feels like light years back to me ancient history but no matter how dated it might look it still makes a delightful time capsule of late fifties new york today i think it's this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film without hollywood improvised and without a real budget seymour cassel who acted and was involved in shadows claims it was jules dassin's the naked city 1948 that was the first and inspired them all but i think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent american filmmakers br br camera obscura 8 10
<START> yul brynner was a symbol of in the of 50 s he play a role of russian leader in hungary at the time of revolution in this country in 1956 that made it against the marxism br br the script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from hungary to england br br the best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the hungarian resistance to kill the russian major yul brynner in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from his bad works but at the end he made a good work to help deborah kerr for escaping her and her darling to london to write in his book a good working to gain at the end people s agreement and after his assassination by the hungarian resistance
<START> i think a several of america's baseball movies are among the best movies ever made when this movie was in production and heard it described as a rugby movie i'd read about the highland team in the newspapers but didn't have high expectations for this film about a sport that didn't interest me br br last night i viewed it on demand and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies ryan little and the cast and crew did an amazing job neil mcdonough was especially convincing as the bad dad he displayed fine range and a subtle but moving character arc br br i also enjoyed the pacific islander actors i've been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture a flashback showing how the islander culture became such a key element of team would have been a excellent addition to the film br br some pretty tacky movies have been shot in utah recently it's good to see a quality film like this from the beehive state
<START> some weeks ago at a movie theater i saw a movie poster of el padrino 2004 with the tag the latin godfather how lame have we become i thought latin just because he is a mexican let me remind you that anything latin comes from or is related to italy so the original guy in the godfather movie is more latin than the mexican godfather and this is why we are called latin american people because we speak spanish a language based in the latin language that originated in rome now italy so to place a tag in a movie poster like the latin godfather is not just ignorant of course if we are trying to related this movie to the original godfather but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a movie classic now about the movie i just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 i guess is 3 the most
<START> i swear i didn't mean to i picked this out only since it looked good on the back this movie wasn't scary at all and actually was very confusing the demon wind was only actually used a couple of times and people were killed off pretty cheesily the one major bright spot was seeing sherri from slaughterhouse play in it seeing what happened to her however made up my mind for this little turkey of a film a 3 out of 10 next
<START> it's a shame there's an interesting idea here but it gets completely lost in a confusion of commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling the plot such as it is concerns a bounty hunter of souls it should be a fairly straightforward hunter hunted kind of story but the director and or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap darth maul mask which they tried to disguise with flowing cg colors not much to recommend here even the title seems to propel it into obscurity
<START> i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self indulgent piece of junk it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after i don't know how folks bleed over there in japan but i hope they have plenty of blood donors
<START> i found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie there was some good stunt work that gave a fair degree of excitement and suspense to the story one did however have to suspend ones credulity on a number of occasions for the plot to work for example despite losing their transfer cable couplings and harness when the pilot retracted the manually they fortunately found a spare on board the aircraft complete with caribbeans according to the plot drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault would disable the alarm system in the vault when the system was reactivated i can't think why according to there battery operated drill would be unable to drill through the vault ceiling however they just happened to have a hydraulic drill complete with hoses and to fit the equally convenient take off points in the planes hydraulic system located above the vault as the plane has a closed hydraulic system it is hard to see how this could be accomplished without affecting the control systems or at least setting hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit accepting this for the sake of the plot it takes them several minutes to drill a small hole through the top of the vault tension will they be able to drill through before fed's get there to check the false alarm yet from the time the vault door closed and before the fed's had walked the few feet to the second security door they had cut a squire hole in the roof of the vault big enough for them to get through one can accept all theses and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good yarn however what spoiled the movie for me was when what appears to have been an effort by the script writers to what up to that point was a fairly predictable ending they killed off the two hero's if one can refer to crocks as hero's brooks one was shot and thrown out of a 747 at 10 000 feet the other sliding down the cable between the two planes the villain with one hand manages to the cable carrying the weight of a full grown man with the air pressure of several hundred miles per hour pressing on him and letting him fall to his death and yet in the next sequence these two without any kind of explanation however tenuous or implausible have miraculously survived the full from 10 000 feet and had time to set up an elaborate scam to get the money the only comment on there survival was to sophie that her brother is a bad shot don't expect an oscar nomination for this one
<START> it is a shame that such a great book was turned into such a terrible movie i could not wait to see this movie after reading the book it really did not do it justice
<START> movies like this make me wonder what modern horror would be like if someone had mercifully for movie fans put an end to m night shyamalan inside the womb this garbage is a prime example of what kind of lame random uninspired last minute generic plot twists have become the norm since movies like the sixth sense and the others were released this was an okay movie until the writers took a dump all over whatever of the mediocre script they had written and decided hey here's an interesting idea lets throw in a wacky twist at the end and make the main character the murderer that'll throw the audience for a loop what an original idea
<START> many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie my movie will always be john carpenter's the thing the main reason why this movie is a cult film is perhaps the splatter effects created mainly by genius rob bottin and that this is the movie that made kurt russell what he is today along with escape from n y in my opinion this is not a great film because of the effects it has to do with the story the atmosphere and of course the acting i have watched thousands and thousands of movies 3 6 every day the last 10 years but none has had the impact on me as this one not even the great das boot br br here's my suggestion to you who likes sci fi and horror movies place yourself in the good chair of your home be sure you're not by anyone if you aint got a projector sit close to your tv and watch this miracle of a film let it you and you'll see it my way br br best view time late february between 5 and 9 in the evening
<START> this movie is funny and sad enough i think that it is kinda true if you love office space then you will love this movie because it is another mike judge hit but it is nothing like office space i told every one to see this movie i only wish that it would have been in more theaters so it would have gotten the recognition it deserved i love this movie and would love to see more from mike judge luke wilson is also what makes this movie what it is i am so glad that i will not be alive in the year because if this movie turns out to be true we are all in for a lot of trouble i just hope more people see this movie because i know that they will fall in love with it too
