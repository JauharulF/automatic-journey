<START> it's all about getting what you want when you want it and the message of eighth wife is to be careful what you wish for until what you wish for wishes for you br br most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn't relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue misogynistic pirates aside cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it learning only too late that it wasn't what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty claudette colbert through a twisted in soul and in practice business deal he ends up marring buying her with the intent of bedding her but she will have none of it literally and frustrates him at every turn and corner and room and tourist attraction br br the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you're not accustomed to and may not enjoy seeing in either cooper or colbert the whole reason i watched the film was because they are likable actors and the whole point of this movie is that they're unlikable people or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves they think from the world br br if you can accept it on its own terms you'll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film and satisfaction as we said is what it's all about such a movie with such a cast only comes around after all once in a ummm blue moon
<START> here's another entertaining clint eastwood action suspense film i am not a particularly fan of his but i have to hand to him he knows how to make entertaining movies this is one more example it didn't hurt either to have john malkovich as his co star now there is an intense actor in this story malkovich plays an assassin and he is fascinating to watch thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given he also has a interesting voice br br rene russo is fairly low key for her but that's fine and eastwood plays the usual loner cop role not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end i guess he couldn't stop playing the dirty harry type figures but he played them well br br there were some negatives this film however namely credibility in parts as there were a couple of times had this been real life the killer would have done away with eastwood the climatic scene in particularly had too many holes in it there also were too many abuses of lord's name in vain in here br br overall however this is good escapist fare
<START> this is probably one of the best french movies i had seen in a very long time this pastiche or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end some references to today's world are very subtle the whole context of the movie is to be understood in light of today's french culture environment that said all the jokes and seemingly shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context are permitted and accepted because this is a parody br br i was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that i should go too and assured me that i was going to have a great time and indeed i had if you liked the old 007 movies with sean connery and also like movies like airplane or hot shots you will be delighted i just hope this movie is released on dvd in the us wait and see
<START> the original road house is by no means an award winning film but it is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time it shouldn't have been that hard to make a sequel there's no need for a big budget big name stars and spectacular visual effects even the story didn't have to be original all it needed was a good time vibe and some great fist fights i don't mean matrix style wire fu just some well choreographed barroom brawls lots of them there are a couple of decent fights in the movie but none of them are memorable and the focus is more on gun play plus the way it ties in to the original film is laughable bordering on insulting johnathon schaech plays shane tanner an undercover dea agent who is good with his hands and feet but here's the kicker he's the son of patrick swayze's character dalton say what let's see the original road house was made in 1989 so for dalton to have a son in his late 20's maybe even 30 in 2006 well you get the idea they give it a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle nate will patton while his father travelled around a lot oh please that itself almost warranted shutting this movie off but i digress schaech is completely out of his element sure he can throw a couple of kicks but he's got nothing going on as an actor plus he's referred to in the movie by the bad guys as pretty boy i've never scrutinized men that closely but i don't think this guy is too good looking he looks sick his face is way too thin and his sunken eyes make it look like he's going to pass out at any moment i'd never heard of him before but i think he should give up acting and go back to his day job jake busey plays the local drug runner wild bill busey is not a terrible actor he was good in starship troopers and even made a menacing villain in hitcher 2 but here he just chews the scenery in standard bad guy mode even his dialog is yawn worthy we're supposed to buy him as the man that has the whole town in his pocket but why what does he do because he wants to buy a bar from patton by any means necessary ellen has the token girlfriend role a woman with a secret too bad that secret is about as difficult to figure out as 2 2 she's the local elementary school teacher who happens to be a former army soldier guess what that means it means that while she may quiver with fear for the majority of the movie she'll be ready to smash heads when the fur starts to fly oh well at least she's hot actually the fight between her and wild bill's girl is the best one in the movie it's fast brutal and entertaining which leads me to my next problem with the movie the fights as i said schaech knows how to throw a punch the same can't be said for anyone he faces in the movie obviously the movie will all come down to schaech versus busey busey is an actor not a fighter he doesn't possess the skills to pull of a movie fight swayze may have been a trained dancer but his athletic ability gave him the means to pull off well choreographed fights he also faced a couple of worthy opponents and had one killer literally move none of that here with a couple of exceptions the fights are forced poorly staged and routine the punches sound like someone smacking a 2x4 on the concrete and there's even a couple of parts where the sound doesn't even match up to the punch it's embarrassing there isn't even the good southern redneck music of the original road house had the jeff healy band who were a somewhat popular band at the time this movie features a singer called john otto whose music is tepid and his acting even worse he's given one line in the movie which was probably inserted to appease whatever fans he may have out there either that or someone owed him a favor my final complaint about the movie is one that comes out of just being picky the continuity movies are shot out of sequence and then it's the editor's job to piece it all together well someone should give the editor of this movie a little shove the problems range from little things like people not looking the same direction when a shot changes to re used footage at the end of the movie in the beginning we are introduced to the bar the black as the camera moves through the bar you see the band the bouncers and the people dancing at the end of the movie when the bad guys have been defeated we get another shot of the same bar with insert shots of our hero sitting at the bar with his girl the problem is the footage of the people in the bar is the same footage from the beginning of the movie i kid you not it's the same people standing or dancing in the same places wearing the same clothes want to know the funniest part you see bouncers in the shot that were killed earlier in the movie do yourself a favor don't watch this movie unless you feel the need to go out and punch someone this movie will make you angry enough to do it
<START> like a terrible cancer raining out of the sky i wandered into this crock on some movie channel the other night being a fan of bad movies and actively engaging in the purchasing and viewing of said bad film i was intrigued by the idea of a genuinely terrible looking action movie coming from modern times after that wore off though i found my hands inexplicably turning against me grabbing at anything in range and stabbing about my head and neck something sinister was in that tape err where was i anyway this ranks among the more embarrassingly bad pieces of film i've run across william forsythe can't play more than one character and that character is always a walking joke even when set into a comic background and given things to do and say that are supposed to be funny ala deuce he's laughable in the wrong way erika eleniak is much the same having starred in her fair share of terrible movies and done terrible jobs in all of them she doesn't fail to help scum up this one classic b movie villain guy andrew divoff does a respectable job but barely even has any scenery to chew on even reliable standby for b movie action daniel bernhardt fails to deliver anything bordering on entertainment as for the film's own merits the plot is lame the script just like the action and the plot movement is both dull and well stupid for lack of a better adjective lord knows they didn't put any effort into it why should i br br anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad ones and anyone who has seen enough bad ones can learn to appreciate them but there is simply nothing here to be enjoyed unless you are among the most bad movie tolerant and simply feel so inclined as to test your mettle before you do though take it from me this one isn't even terrible enough to be enjoyed unlike say some of the more ludicrous italian zombie films a fan of b movie action would be much better off checking out most any of other films or pretty much anything else that has ever been put to film for that matter america simply is not the place to go to for action it seems especially not now if you have a craving check out anything from over the seas films like heroic duo or the slightly less normal along with anything else in the awesome keita amemiya's cannon will provide a lot more fun and way better action than your apt to find elsewhere especially here
<START> i knew next to nothing about this movie until i chanced to rent it it was a very pleasant surprise the cast is excellent including matthau whom i do not normally care for he makes a credible romantic lead hawn is a sweet kook and bergman is touching as a woman coming out of her shell
<START> it seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches some manage to do so with great talent hervÃ© doesn't on the paper the movie looked interesting though the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy dark humour and a very style director unfortunately kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater the movie is incredibly slow and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous what could have been a stylish funny mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom
<START> my wife and kids was and still is the best comedy series on tv ever made i really enjoyed it and everyone in the u k still watch the the wayans bros should all somehow be featuring together in a comedy show my wife and kids was a comedy the whole family could watch and you don't get that very often isn't there anything we can do to make it happen again we would do anything to have that comedy show on again 1 damon wayans should make a come back i would really like damon wayans to star or make another comedy like this one of course with the help of the whole wayans family i was really sad when it ended that way and i hope they will be more to come in the future brilliant comedy excellent stuff yours truly
<START> carlos mencia just plain isn't funny his show is painful to watch because of that his sketches parodies are all very horrible and this really just feels like a filler for the chapelle show which while i'm not a big fan of that it is much funnier than this trash carlos mencia gives the stupid speeches and he all too often depends on finishing his monologues with a retarded voice and going der der der it's just not funny he often when talking to others makes puns they are horrible and painful when people don't laugh he blames them why would anyone laugh he's not funny he has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show it's amazing that anyone but 3 year olds watch this one of my least favorite things he does is water down every topic and make it seem like a joke i hope that this racist idiot gets taken off the air as soon as possible because he's dumbing down a station that doesn't need to be dumbed down anymore
<START> i saw this on dvd with subtitles which made it a little frustrating to get through because of the film's length but i was riveted throughout all of it that i was fascinated by the characters and always engrossed in the story despite the subtitles is a testament to the film's power it's an amazing piece of work i have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time it's easily the best foreign film i've seen in the last twenty years or so i would like to know the full story behind the making of this film it must have taken a very long time and required the use of hundreds of locations its use of some hardcore scenes on the tv in the motel room may unfortunately make some people choose not to see it but if you don't mind those you'll be deeply moved by all the stories in this one
<START> cheerleader massacre 2003 br br starring sheffield charity erin byron leonard johnson e eddie edwards samantha phillips gigi april flowers nikki fritz tylo tyler brad beck summer williams brinke stevens melissa br br plot a group of cheerleaders along with their coach and three guys are on their way to a game when suddenly their van breaks down and they take refuge in a nearby cabin soon they drink have sex and are brutally murdered one by one by an unseen killer br br the good a few laughs surprising identity of the killer a brinke stevens cameo my favorite scene from the slumber party massacre used as a flashback br br the bad i was excited about this film i loved all three slumber party massacre's because they were just so fun and i was expecting a lot from this slumber party sorority house massacre with scream tones but it just sucked they overdid it on the we're cheesy but proud thing and basically made soft core porn but with a good who dun it br br
<START> i loved this film which i have just seen at the philadelphia film festival in march 2005 i went to india with 2 friends and this movie was very real i related to everything and savored every moment the characters are believable the story poignant and the ending realistic but not sentimental i also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing this movie shows very well the blending but not complete mixing of 2 worlds east and west the supporting cast was wonderful depicting the life a tourist encounters in india quite realistically the humor is subtle and at times dry and this makes it all the more realistic as it is woven into the daily escapades of the characters it is so easy to identify with each of the situations portrayed
<START> pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses rachel leigh cook is the sole highlight in a tender and sexy performance but i would recommend this film only to die hard fans of the actress
<START> one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middle man di a physically non descript middle aged man originally from in southern italy when we're introduced to him at the start of the film he's been living a non life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di cash tell him that 10 000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked at the news he quietly but threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love is exactly the reason behind the beginning of di troubles br br this initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who won't even reply in kind to and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about at one point in his non life decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous the first half of the film may be described as slow by some it does indeed reveal di days and nights in that hotel at an oddly deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details however scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes the existence of di the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out br br never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le or another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia not unlike the machinist and in a far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious it's almost impossible to pin point its cause if indeed there is one br br the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani grand daughter of the legendary anna and the memory of best friend a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though it's never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the expectations le is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino like fare more la vita bella style films neglecting to explore fine creations like le and others your loss world
<START> recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual but the entire family without resorting to preaching or hollywood sappy endings tony drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way br br highest praise goes david tennant and sarah parish for their incredible performances i had presumed before watching the drama that i would see some of their previous on screen relationship in blackpool bleed through but it never does neither actor is recognizable from any previous work and i didn't see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes in addition harry performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic throughout the piece he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house br br at times nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic as the viewer i wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality stop moping and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives but under the same circumstances i see myself acting like any of them switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything including behavior that is completely unlike myself it's the show's greatest strength truth without sugar coating to force us all to think what we'd be able to do under the same circumstances br br this is a difficult but must watch show i hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the u s
