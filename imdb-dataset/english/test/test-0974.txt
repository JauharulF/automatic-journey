<START> just caught the rain people on turner classic movies late one night the film was released in 1969 shirley knight stars as natalie a long island housewife who exact reasons unknown leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip not knowing exactly where she is going natalie is also newly pregnant which complicates things along the way she picks up a brain damaged ex football player jimmy james caan who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking there are many twists and turns along the way between these two as natalie struggles to take care of jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself she is going through her own struggles needless to say and in no position to care for him natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times she makes some odd phone calls to her husband who begs her to come home natalie tries to dump jimmy several times only to have him re enter her life through circumstances a young robert duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends natalie you get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly and it does this film is certainly uneven at times and the script is somewhat lacking francis ford coppola directed this and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing the godfather the actors are good ones needless to say as they all would have futures ahead of them in film shirley knight is the least known of the three although she is also underrated as an actor james caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character this film remains little more than a curiosity now no doubt because it is an early movie of coppola's and i confess i had never heard of it so god bless turner classic movies for bringing it to a new audience
<START> oddball black comedy romance featuring a great cast and a less than stellar script brenda blethyn lovely amazing is the title character a woman trapped in a loveless marriage with a man who is obviously having an affair with his beautiful blonde secretary guess who's playing this minor role yup naomi watts mulholland drive must of sandwiched this project in before her superstar status was insured with the blockbuster thriller the ring br br on the male side of the cast list there's the woefully miscast alfred molina frida an old fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his desires for which have lain dormant for decades perhaps miramax is hoping molina's turn in the upcoming spider man 2 might generate some interest in this little trinket which belongs on the dvd rental shelf br br but the award for wildest thankless performance goes to christopher walken catch me if you can who goes completely over the top as 'modern' undertaker with his vegas style funerals in a small provincial town his character must have into the village because there's little reason for him to exist in this script br br that said if you'd like to see some top notch actors engage in some low brow humor then this one's for you and if this isn't your cup of tea then try renting harold and maude the ultimate funeral movie that's still funny to this day
<START> when jurassic park first came out it was revolutionary in filmaking and special effects for the first ever time people cold go to a dinosaur movie and be convinced they were looking at real dinosaurs brought to life however whilst some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what the real creatures could have been like t rex triceratops etc some were altered to fit the movie velociraptor and the film took place n the present on a tropical island where they were not in their natural habitat walking with dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real habitats all those millions of years ago the amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great now we can view sights such as a grim desert a whole herd of an give birth a massive sea monster a eye view dinosaurs thriving in the south pole two lock horns t rex roaring at the camera and the impact of the comet that spelled their doom these dinosaurs walk run feed fight breed hunt and swim but the series also reveals the other creatures that they shared the world with two episodes are mainly focused on two different kinds of animals the flying and the marine reptiles that lived beneath the waves the locations and scenery are spectacular and look all the more unique when a cg dino walks onto screen and as for the cgi and animatronics the movements of the cgi dinosaurs look totally and completely natural the colouring is bright and vivid and the crewmen have taken careful steps to ensure that the cg animals interact with their environments in any way an actual creature would by making splashes in the water brushing by bushes kicking up dust and casting shadows on the ground admittedly the cg isn't perfect with a few brief instances where the animals look too but the rest of the time it looks breathtaking the puppetry is poor in some cases but it has its moments particularly the scene with the in the first episode the narration by kenneth branagh is pretty good as well giving us vital bits of information and drama at the same time but of course the true pleasure is seeing a living dinosaur doing what they did all those years ago and also seeing some truly cute moments with mammal reptile hybrid pups baby and t rex chicks yes even t rex can be cute and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and was even more so back then all this adds up to a prehistoric nature masterpiece that lets you see a real dinosaur and take your breath away all from the safety of your living room if you like nature dinosaurs informative learning amazing visuals or just to have a truly good viewing and be entertained then walking with dinosaurs is definitely for you easily recommended
<START> is not a terrible movie but it is quite forgettable the lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye strain special effects are imaginative but obvious the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there of course along with the archetypical teenagers but the whole movie just doesn't gel what was needed was some dialogue and more tongue in cheek humor br br i can't really recommend that you use your time watching this movie i often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor but these are sadly lacking in this film
<START> this film is really a big piece of trash trying to make itself look like a hollywood production poor story outline stupid robot story ultra bad acting by untalented pop idols and they are trying to fight my goodness those miserable actors uses wires to make them look like they are good fighters and i hate that arrogant edison chen the worst actor i have ever seen i will never touch his movies again avoid this movie at all costs i wanted to give it a negative value out of ten not even worth a 0 10
<START> this movie is perfect for any aspiring screen writer actor or director by watching this movie you will see all the things that are wrong with the film industry as it is today there are so many clichÃ©s that it pained me to sit through this movie nothing about it is original and every single line spoken has been ripped off from those clichÃ©d movies that we all saw in the 90's although it does have a few cheap laughs overall it is wrong wrong wrong i was so immensely bored and the movie was so predictable and pathetic i actually noticed how much make up was caked onto tara reid's face to hide those massive bags and wrinkles from her endless partying seriously she was wearing so much foundation you could literally scrape it off and an entire bottle of it br br what shocked me though was that so many of the talented and popular cast would sign on for this piece of junk and i do not know how i sat through that horrible screaming that ashton kutcher does you know when he's like angry or something and he shouts his words in this annoying manner horrifying talking tara's face being ten shades darker than her neck a drugged up owl a script that seemed like the work of a three year old br br seriously in my whole life there has been no movie that i have watched that i did not in someway enjoy no matter how bad it was this deserves an award for being the first bad bad bad i don't think there is a single word in the english dictionary that can possibly describe this trashy movie today i was trying to re watch it but i had to turn it off like ten minutes in because i was about to cry from the overwhelming amount of clichÃ©s br br don't even bother to rent this at your blockbuster it's not worth a cent as a matter of fact i am willing to pay anyone out there considering to watch this movie so they can go do something decent with their lives
<START> oh my oh this is a really bad movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the script is god awful and the photography is simply dreadful br br what does make this movie stand out however is that you never once care about a single soul good guy or bad guy living dying or dead in the entire 87 minutes oh s he died huh figured they would was the best reaction i could muster after each murder characters are so black or white that with the volume turned off you could still figure out who was who while the cast's voices had an odd monotone quality throughout their faces give the impression that you're looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow exaggerated frowns and pensive looks each character is a humorless passionless one dimensional one trick pony once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation they are summarily dismissed br br it vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas nielsen director writer of american title decided to do a low budget version of american psycho and got kind of distracted along the way br br this isn't a particularly gruesome movie the cold passionless cast ensures that it isn't an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so it is simply and after all a bad movie br br avoid it we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on pay per view as part of my penance i'm writing this review br br enough said
<START> this movie was well done but it also made me feel very down at times as well for anyone that is considering show business this is a must see as it shows the raw deal in what goes on for these struggling workers the soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dancing complimented it nicely some of the student's attitudes might have been a little far fetched like leroy's especially because i'm sure someone like that would've been kicked out immediately for refusing to read and such if this was the real high school for performing arts the coco screen test is hard to watch for any people out there with weak stomachs please heed my warning while it's very gritty i know it's the truth on what happens so in this respect the movie is right on overall it's entertaining and even though some parts drag on the majority goes by really quickly br br final grouping br br movies probably would've skipped this one br br dvd purchase not something i'd need to see again and again br br rental worth renting at least once in your life
<START> yes indeed we have a winner a winner in best dumb action movie br br the only reason i chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad made that it actually becomes funny br br night hunter is basically about jack cutter a vampire hunter vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries apparently and his mission being that he has to kill the last remaining vampires br br this movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes i have ever seen in my life not to mention the really bad gun shooting scenes when people are shot in this movie blood splatters thick as ketchup all over the place this makes the movie seem so cheap and lame that you just lose interest a constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me the most during the fight scenes this is i suppose done to create an action effect though in my opinion it gives no effect whatsoever its completely ridiculous br br all stunt scenes are done extremely badly e g a scene where the dead vampire leader gets thrown off a roof when the corpse hits the ground it bounces like a wobbly rubber doll a scene where jack sniffs the ground getting a vision was so lame it got me laughing hysterically br br lame music cheesy scenes bad acting and plain dumb filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie such a malfunction to state that this is a good movie would be the same as stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best action movies haven't seen many in your life br br this is basically a b class vampire action movie that deserves 0 10 but which i'll give 10 10 just for its ability being the lousiest action movie i have ever seen of making me laugh and because i just can't live without it
<START> you've got to think along the lines of last tango in paris for this one because the mood and emotion runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights the difference being that in this exceptional intense and torrid depiction of love among the ruins of a dispossessed the setting is a gay milieu perhaps even one that is set to vanish in time and not the equally arresting but heterosexual context of bertolucci's own film br br the last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema to talk of pornography or gay self misses the point and intelligence of this work this film though on first impression appears to take us into the familiar often depicted underworld of gay street life then precedes to subvert the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a super real degree the result is a hyper charged emotional heightening an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of big universal themes and giant gestures br br this film snatches the high ground because of the brilliant performances by it's actors notably a young jean hugues anglade and the directing a tour de force of cinema outstanding in ambition and it's unceasing plummet into the depths of human emotion as a contribution to gay cinema this film conquers this difficult ground and makes it it's own triumph
<START> propaganda pro american war effort film that came out in 1942 has the east side kids getting tough against any japanese they spot in their own neighborhood when they learn they're too young to enlist ultimately they learn they were mistaken in their mistrust of some individuals but also happen to stumble across a spy ring they then set out to bust the film is harmless enough in its fashion although some may well take offense given how innocent asians really did get singled out during the second world war overall though it's a pretty generic effort and both leo gorcey and huntz hall would have better moments the best of which tend to come here when they ad lib
<START> this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film my uncle's home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crap br br the plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island the man has a very cheap paper looking hand br br the acting is atrocious in this movie there are scene changes at the drop of the hat for instance for at least 30 seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life i don't think this movie could get any worse then it already is i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong and i hate chuck norris
<START> i love this film it was made just before the la punk scene changed for the worse it perfectly preserves the mood and attitude of that time and place i feel really lucky to have been present at the filming of four of the bands at the fleetwood that night the only part that doesn't fit in too well is the sections with catholic and their socio political commentary i didn't see too many people who were into that at all the rest of the film shows attitudes that i witnessed a lot people dealing with hard lives or taking a swing at the music industry and or lousy hippies i don't think i've seen a documentary that captures so authentically and personally the subject matter being covered
<START> his john dark kevin connor fantasy adventures were a mainstay of summer holiday movies in the days before star wars they weren't masterpieces they didn't boast state of the art special effects but they were exactly what an audience of kids wanted from a film back in the mid 70s br br at the earth's core catches just the right tone for the appropriately named burroughs' pulp adventure about victorian inventor peter cushing and the inevitable doug mcclure ending up in the underground world of and battling its evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs this time the puppets are gone in favour of men in monster suits which is a lot more fun if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and if you're not there's always caroline munro's cleavage to look at aside from what may well be peter cushing's worst performance an irritating but rehash of his movie dr who you can't me i'm british it's easily the best of the john dark kevin connor doug mcclure fantasy adventures surprisingly well directed and boasting an atmospheric use of colour never especially good at exterior scenes alan hume's photography gains immensely from the control a studio set gives him the film was shot entirely on soundstages to paint a luridly vivid world worthy of a pulp novel cover not high art but definitely great saturday matinÃ©e fun
<START> i just saw this film again i believe for the sixth time i will doubtless see it many more times this is one of the most brilliant french films ever made although the film is mysterious even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director gilles for ten years he has not made another film and this was his only one the story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect and it is clearly paying homage continually to both hitchcock and buster keaton the split second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on keaton in 'steamboat bill and he is only not killed by inches in this film people stoop and turn and pass one another unawares and if they had been one second off they would have collided the storyline thus walks a tightrope of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond or you will miss something crucial the haunting albeit intentionally repetitive music by peter chase is reminiscent of hitchcock's and the whole film has the same eerie quality but whereas hitchcock had one woman be two women has two women be one woman thereby inverting the plot structure there are passing references to other hitchcock films but it is which is central to the inspiration of this film the theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events the invisible threads behind the tapestry the ineffable everything is hyper charged with passionate love and desire but the desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object that is why it is so easily from lisa to alice when it is realised that it is alice who is more mysterious than lisa and it is alice who truly embodies the eternal mystery the film is ultimately by she is so fascinating that she outshines monica bellucci which is really something to pull off considering that bellucci is a knockout beauty whereas is what the english call however had even at this early date more than mastered the art of whereby beautiful girls fall by the wayside and don't get noticed because is being so fascinating you can't take your eyes off her long enough even to look at the beautiful girls and you end up only thinking of her most of us remember i'm sure her father richard lying in a bathtub listening to opera in the film many years ago i would rather watch than richard lying in a bathtub but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating because richard is spellbinding too and he isn't even a woman looks as if she may turn into anna magnani when she is much older and that means she will get an oscar if someone can only write another for her the girl has so much passion inside her she could set the seine on fire wouldn't it be wonderful if she and julie delpy teamed up this film made wonderful use of paris locations but where is this in the it looked like place to me maybe i missed something i must watch the film another six times just to study the precision of the timing and who brushes past whom and make sure i've got it right the whole thing is like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games played blindfolded by a grandmaster how thrilling it all is you can look through my window anytime come on over let's discuss impossibilities coincidence synchronicity everything that is going on that is invisible and how it effects the visible and once again we have here the spirit of novel embodied in a great french work of art more more more
