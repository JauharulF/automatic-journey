<START> my parents may enjoy this show but i fail to find the humor in it what is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team absolutely nothing it's a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays blame that on shows like the dating game and the newlywed game bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid 1960s sure the series has its touching moments still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series this is nothing like the family oriented days of i love lucy some five decades before br br an answer i would have to why this series plays on the lifetime cable channel is because that channel's brass think women can relate to character i absolutely dislike the character of reba hart's daughter kyra she is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager funny i wonder if the actress who played kyra scarlett is like that in real life away from acting who plays the blockhead ex husband dentist christopher rich is not much better barbara jean played by melissa is ditsy in herself the characters of van and cheyenne are also very annoying br br something else that baffles me is why the dingbat of a series creator allison m gibson decided to set the series in where i live 25 miles away from houston texas reba mcentire isn't even from this state she's an why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting what i mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it but the melodies are basically tuneless
<START> go fish garnered rose rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise br br its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms the entire film rings hollow i cringed the whole way through br br its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality well not much more here to be learned than from in and out by now most of us actually do know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes br br seldom has this revelation been portrayed on the screen with so little wit and style br br pathetic
<START> this is an oft used line but it really sums up this movie if this is the current state of gay cinema then we're in real trouble i saw this film at because of the high imdb rating 7 6 and if there was ever a case of vote stacking on imdb then this is it just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the film br br easy plot boy finds out his high school ex boyfriend is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to his old hometown still carrying a 10 year old torch to see what happened br br first off i liked latter days the director's last feature despite its cookie cutter characters and plot contrivances but you're supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release i don't know how you get horrible supporting performances out of so many tv veterans robert foxworth joanna cassidy tori spelling but somehow he managed to the writing was lifetime network quality way back when they were really bad and the situations were unbelievable and uncomfortably hard to watch i kept reaching for a non existent remote control to fast forward but ultimately made myself stay to the end hoping for a decent ending ugh no even the gratuitous male nudity that popped up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats br br to be fair the 2 leads especially in the gratuitous nude scenes were gorgeous there was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship as they uncovered how they went separate ways and the film looked great good quality and color saturation for an independent film br br how is it that network tv can give week after week of great entertaining weekly episodes like ugly betty housewives etc but so many feature releases in similar genres can be as bad as this
<START> i saw a sneak preview of this tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast after seeing sneak peaks for boogeyman horrible 3 10 and amityville remake so so 6 10 i enjoyed this a lot more as seen in the trailer one knock i had was believing that a whole town could be forgotten but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so i accept it for what it is br br my only major complaint is i assumed paris hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc and moan that's hot but they didn't do that how could they resist br br there is no nudity from the 2 girls although paris looks great in her lingerie i'm surprised they didn't put a 3rd hot token victim in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick i won't list any death or plot spoilers but i will say that paris eliza both get roughed up good br br the characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable not like cabin fever where you wanted them to die and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the 1st 30 minutes like most horror films br br i give it a 8 10 as it delivered good scares and gore and i had low expectations going into it if you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies you'll have a good time br br noah
<START> what gives anthony the right to ruin two extraordinary works of fiction first he destroyed the english patient which was bad enough but now i discover he's butchered cold mountain butchered br br i had such a strange reaction to the english patient my son and i went to see it the first weekend it was released and i was so disappointed but told my son i felt like i needed to read the book i drove straight to barnes and noble bought it read it and tried to figure out what in the world the critics were talking about when they said had trusted enough in the intelligence of the movie going public to give them a great film that is what he most surely did not do br br i do not ordinarily read a great deal of fiction but cold mountain was so highly recommended by friends that i felt compelled to read it i did not see cold mountain the movie when it played in theaters and it was because of what had done to the english patient but like a fool i rented it today and i'm so upset i had to vent my frustration and most of all my sadness that someone could have taken this beautiful story and crafted it into something almost as beautiful on the screen and now they never will br br read the book and let the movie rot on the shelf i will never be taken in by a project again i think he may be one of the worst directors working today and i'm tired of the praise hollywood heaps upon his head it must be that no one in hollywood reads anymore this movie bears no resemblance to the book except for the names of the characters ego must know no bounds and if he didn't like the book then why didn't he write an original screenplay and leave the book alone even if i hadn't read the book i would still consider this movie one of the worst i've seen from 2003 and i've seen almost everything that's been released for viewing in the usa br br elaine you aren't going to like this one either
<START> the famous french detective henri takes his first vacation in 11 years in st margot where he meets nanette the daughter of the vacation spot proprietors despite nanette being promised to childhood sweetheart leon henri and nanette fall in love and decide to marry despite father due to henri's age on the day of their wedding leon returns and nanette runs after him nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead and henri swears he won't rest until he can find the killer the only clue henri has to work with is a footprint found by leon but he is also getting written warnings that others will die soon soon mother is found dead and henri has no idea as to the identity of the killer thinking himself a failure he returns to paris then he realizes and fears that the killer can be only one person even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation out of the ordinary murder mystery that doesn't really follow the formula in other of the genre by columbia or other b studios credit to that certainly goes to director lewis who does manage to turn this into a noirish film despite the setting of the film also aided by the use of good camera work and lighting turns in a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the cast is able to carry their performance rating 8
<START> best club scenes that i have seen in a long time atmosphere mesmerising matthew performance is impeccable and faultless i would recommend this film to any age group watch out for
<START> it's partly bad luck for that it comes out after shakespeare in love as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art art as life and the magic of the theatre and the same archetypal foibles of theater folk but a whole lot more ponderously br br there are scenes that come alive as a play develops and gets by a writer's life but there's a whole lot of orson welles ish ego in this produced by directed by lead acted by john torturro as a vehicle for his wife katharine with an adorable cameo by their son br br each actor gets his her moment literally in the spotlight but there's so many or set pieces that seem like 19th century parlor games bill irwin talks susan sarandon gets to be a diva christopher walken gets to be a different kind of villain a gay critic the women have to disrobe unnecessarily because this is an art film br br the art and set direction are marvelous though quite dark this should get an award as the best use of a jersey city theater as a set ever in a movie originally written 8 21 99
<START> this movie is one that belongs on the cutting room floor for one the opening sequence does not put forth the element of 'gang' related subject if it wasn't supposed to then at least they got that part right secondly whats with all the glancing to the left and then to the right they even do it in synchronous style nowhere have i witnessed a member from a rival crew walk up to a bar look for someone from the outside lookin like he is all that and a bag o chips at a barbie and walk away without even being confronted let alone get 'what for' i wasted money on the rental price and am glad i did not purchase the dvd itself br br if this was made by college t a f e students then at least they gave it the old aussie try better luck next time
<START> i saw 2 hour version of choker bali i cannot say that is long the movie has a certain natural pace to it and does not seem to lag at any time the costume and the set are reminiscent of what we would see in old movies br br aishwarya rai has done a good job of acting it is indeed a mature role with enough scope for acting within the story the script also supports the story very well acts as the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage the movie is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict she faces with the downtrodden condition of widows in those times br br her best friend in this movie is played by sen has also been well handled her innocence and her admiration of aishwarya's capability to speak english and act educated has been done very well these are indeed some of the prevailing mindsets of those times we can see how far we have come from such an era br br the movie speaks of womens liberation as subtle line of the story i found the development of the story very similar to also written by tagore it does rope in some action from the independence struggle and puts in contrast the struggle for indian independence against the silent struggle for womens rights br br a well made movie definitely worth watching aishwarya's acting par excellence has handled the story with great care yet another classic from tagore
<START> dr cameron a discredited scientist succeeds with his experiment in creating serum the transforms men into wolf like creatures originally developing this formula to help the world the scientist decides to use his newly created subject to exact revenge upon the scientists who were responsible for his from the scientific community the scientist's daughter grows wary of her father's actions and shares her suspicions with a newspaper reporter when the scientist loses control of his creature it falls upon the scientist's daughter and the reporter to stop it according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br mad scientist george zucco as lorenzo cameron creates his formula rather unimaginatively by mixing human and wolf blood this brings the beast out in hulking glenn strange as aka pedro who is directed to act like lon chaney jr in of mice and men johnny downs as tom gregory and anna as cameron are a likable werewolf hunter and damsel in distress certainly the mad monster is no substitute for the wolf man but it's a serviceable addendum the grainy black and white photography enhances the foggy cow webbed atmosphere god uncredited strikes up a well done ending too like blaine robert strange said the blood of man and beast is downright sacrilege br br the mad monster 1942 sam george zucco johnny downs anna
<START> john huston made many remarkable and memorable films those most often and easily recalled were released long before his passing in 1987 it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead br br once long ago a very wise man called doc asked me doesn't the dead seem remarkably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in dubliners i tend to think that it is the story and film both contain some of joyce's societal comments and criticisms but for the most part paint a warm and loving portrait of an ireland joyce himself so often against and would shortly leave br br huston's handling of protagonist gabriel conroy who realizes the world as he sees it is nothing more than an illusion is simply remarkable to claim that the film lacks plot is to miss the point as with any of joyce's dubliners plot while most certainly present is not the focus plot is merely a tool for the of the protagonist's epiphany in addition to a seeming lack in action there is quite frankly little dialogue in joyce's short story for the director to lean on huston's ability to translate what joyce puts in words into visuals is quite possibly the movie's greatest triumph feelings thoughts gabriel's discomfort during the dance all these leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal br br to claim that huston has softened his writer's criticism of society again misses the mark while the dead may be painted with a cheerful hue the complacency and pretense of the film's characters is but a comment on society on a smaller scale we are the old aunts the embarrassing drunk the tenor with the sore throat the wife with the sad rain soaked secret even the self deluded middle aged man br br but the dead belies its title it is not a dark story nor is it really that bleak forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the inherent symbolism in it forget the shambles of a life gabriel awakes to at the film's end it is only with the destruction of the illusions gabriel has of himself and of his world that he can truly go forward such is the central point of the film such is the central point of our lives
<START> flash gordon is undoubtedly the best of all american serials in a date so early as 1936 universal was capable of making such an entertainment story and twenty years later when i watched it for the first time as a kid it involved me in a great adventure and emotion buster crabbe was the hero we always wanted to be in our childhood and jean rogers the beautiful girl we always dreamt to be in love with dragons octopus monsters gorillas were also the attraction charles middleton was a great presence as ming the merciless a true predecessor of george
<START> this one and the one prior toulon's revenge and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice it is basically choose your series the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers while the next three are a series of them being the good guys this one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and i never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series basically a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action japanese shows like the movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very painful to watch movie just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie you do get to see the guy who played toulon in the last movie though then you have a very anti climatic battle and wham the movie is over before it really begins
<START> george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his to their death at the battle of little big horn they died with their boots on paints a different picture of general custer in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and misdeeds are mostly to his love for adventure br br errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point custer distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments in spite of his poor standing he graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army through an error custer receives a promotion in rank before this can be corrected he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero custer returns to his hometown marries his sweetheart libby who is played by olivia de havilland libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans to prove his intentions he enters into a treaty with crazy horse the leader of the sioux when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers br br errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant arrogant romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene olivia de havilland's depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender more gentle side the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn who had acted together in several other movies is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland anthony quinn as crazy horse sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining br br the reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie while it is not historically accurate it is very entertaining the movie has a little bit of everything it has adventure comedy and romance so it appeals to a large variety of audiences the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land br br
