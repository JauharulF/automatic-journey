<START> my wife and i met doing a professional production of the merry widow in 1982 in english but a straight translation br br only the very basic skeleton of the original plot is visible in this adaptation most of the characters have been deleted along with the entire b plot and all but one of the characters remaining have been renamed most of the characters in the movie aren't in the operetta either the action has been moved from paris to at first washington dc and then to the fictional country of which the movie has renamed and only later to paris the net result is that we don't reach the beginning of the original play until about 45 minutes in br br and the main source of tension in the plot is deleted too in the original years before count and the heroine were very much in love but his family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor it's his broken heart that has rendered him a careless playboy now that as a widow she's the richest woman in the world she still loves him and he still loves her but his pride won't let him admit it to anyone even himself and she must spend three acts playing mind games to break him down the trope of the aristocrat with money problems who won't admit that he's in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think supplied the main plots of a substantial fraction of viennese for decades after the 1906 widow in this movie they've never met before which rips out not only the heart of the whole thing but nearly all the comedy br br lamas does a pretty decent job though br br an interesting musical point is that several times we hear a snippet or so of parisien an extra song written in english despite the title for the london which was not as far as i know usually found in american productions until the 1980s or so
<START> having read most of the comments i feel like i have a word to say as well br br what bothers me most is that most people here are think that this movie is either pro or con to the subject of death penalty and whether it worked with them i remember having read an article back in 1995 when the film was published yes it has interested me so much ever since i heard that it would come out that i have not forgotten about the articles i read back then in which tim robbins said that he did not want to make a movie to convince audiences of neither one nor the other br br and i think that is completely right i have to admit that i believe that in the way he made this film he did tend a little bit to the anti death penalty side but nevertheless people are still allowed to make their own choice and this is a very rare thing in american films br br i have shown this movie to many people since it came out and i have seen all kinds of reactions death penalty supporters became opponents or became even stronger in their belief and many death penalty opponents including me grew stronger in their belief that death penalty should be abolished everywhere in the world but i have even seen opponents turn into supporters this and the fact that people here seem to fight about it shows to me that there are really many ways of looking at it so whatever effect it has on you the important thing is that it makes you think br br this is one of the few movies that really gives you the choice that does not shy away with a simple path by making the convicted either bad or innocent this may be a tough thing for people who prefer being entertained or tought a lesson there is no lesson here you need to find one yourself br br everyone praises the acting directing and the music but since this has been said so many times the i will not repeat it all again br br so if you have not seen this yet do so if you dare to be challenged
<START> unfortunately this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s which were pale imitations of the original the intelligent egyptologist imhotep has been replaced by a leg dragging frankenstein in mummy who exhibits no signs of intelligent life this film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen the mummy 1932 you will be disappointed
<START> br br mild spoilers ahead br br we dive at dawn is an english made movie with john mills in the lead role the second time i watched the dvd version was on a big screen tv and i must say the movie is better than i thought the first time i saw it on the screen may be it was the big screen viewing that helped br br i still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission the movie takes off too the search for the german battleship named the and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting br br i'm increasing my rating to 7 10 if you enjoy ww ii films i think you'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor too
<START> being a child of the 1980s i grew up with numerous educational as well as programs or both and continue to learn so much from them now that i admire the wisdom of those who worked on them after learning that sesame street to name the best example was not solely responsible for the fact that i could read at an adult level before i could walk it only increased the level of disgust i feel not only towards the lyons corporation and its product but those who defend them too as if i had faith in those we assign to protect us or our children to begin with the fact that barney friends still pollutes our airwaves after more than a decade later is a discredit not only to the fcc american commerce and its makers it is a discredit to all of humanity in a world where i can be harassed without recourse by the police welfare services and child protection agencies simply for being born different to those in power yet broadcasters are allowed to pump this drivel into my home uncontested you have to ask what is wrong with people br br you see in a world where we are expected to behave like adults and account for ourselves what we say to our sons and daughters is of importance because it will often have consequences long after we are gone not only are our attempts to make our children more normal more alike more think alike potentially devastating what we end up teaching them to be normal has a big part to play too so the question becomes one of what barney is teaching our children to be normal apart from lessons such as that we are not good if we do not have good feelings or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we come up short other shocking things we are shown on the barney show include barney molesting children the issue of child abduction and child molestation is a big one in our society and has been ever since we started trying to pretend it was not but that would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways in which to present the topic br br so far i have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons barney himself presents adding to the problem is the children shown on the show i use the word children loosely here as the range of ages shown goes as low as three years and as high as fourteen yet no difference in emotional response is shown at either extreme fourteen year olds react to barney and his proposed situations in the exact same way as five year olds experts in childhood and adolescent autism especially consider this an incredibly foul thing to expose children to adults on the autistic spectrum who faced increasing problems as their needs were not only not met but flat out ignored have a tendency to watch this and feel an urge to do the kinds of things with barney that would make fourteen year olds cry as irreverent and sick as shows targeted toward the elder child market such as you can't do that on television were they stamp all over barney by demonstrating that not only do different ages respond to the same thing in different ways so too do different people br br so in response to i have to say that i hope like hell they do not have children for every time i see a parent showing their child this drivel it gives me an overwhelming urge to report them to the police for child abuse and i speak as a man whose entire upbringing was dominated by abuse they might sing about manners loving caring or sharing but the examples they show are not only so as to be the opposite of educational they are so devoid of realism as to become dangerous as the light triton has already pointed out the kind of lessons children learn from barney are that people do not vary feelings must be suppressed at all costs and rules are entirely arbitrary when compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go around and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me as a boy it still boggles the mind that the authorities have yet to step in and yank this trash off the air if a parent did to their child what barney does around the world they would face criminal charges br br hence i gave barney my favourite two out of ten score that i give to all rubbish with absolutely no redeeming value in a world of adults that know how to properly respond to their children it has no place
<START> three zany couples all six of a kind become entangled in a madcap search for stolen bank loot br br this is a lively hilarious comedy with the six stars charlie mary boland w c fields alison george burns gracie allen all heartily engaged in doing what they did best getting laughs br br boland make another of their film appearances as husband wife this time rather more amorous than usual they were a perfect team she the strident lioness he the nervous rabbit and they dominate most of the screen time here from beginning to end they are a delight br br burns allen continue the patter they originated in vaudeville perfected on radio would eventually take to television with george the perpetual straight man gracie the eternal fool at times in the film she tends to go a bit over the top but it's difficult to dislike her her heart was obviously made of solid gold br br while is given rather short shrift only fragments of her formidable personality flash through fields is in his element as the disreputable sheriff of nevada whether explaining how he got the nickname john' or skulking about at night looking for the missing he is never less than wonderful best of all he gets to perform his entire classic pool routine preserving it forever for a grateful posterity finally he executes the near miraculous he gets gracie to shut up br br paramount was so pleased with the success of six of a kind that they wanted to hurry the principle players into another comedy only fields he felt he had now arrived at the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics the studio finally agreed and began preparation of fields' first solo starring feature you're telling me 1934
<START> has expanded the limits of john turturro's mediocrity from second rate actor to third rate director writer and producer this film was dreadful it is disjointed and from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main story line br br we are served with a smorgasbord of fragmented scenes each a non sequitur to all the others the only thread that seems to run through them is that they occur in the lives of the members of the same theatre repertory company the few scenes that do matter to the plot are so convoluted that you frequently can't tell if the dialogue is from the story or the actors running their lines for the play within the story br br if this story were a person it would be a schizophrenic with personality disorder it couldn't decide if it was a drama a romance a comedy a tragedy a sex farce or a parody of theatre it came closest to being bearable as a sex farce br br turturro was lifeless and impassive as supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose play gets its big chance when the currently running show needs to be cancelled due to the illness of the lead actor susan sarandon gave a good performance as the aging actress trying to seduce for a role unfortunately she found it necessary to go topless which only goes to illustrate that the hardware of aging sex symbols is much better left to the imagination walkin gave a delightful performance as the uppity theatre critic who makes impassioned overtures to a member of the cast beverly d'angelo and ben gazzara also had minor roles br br i gave this film a 2 other than walken's vignette there is really not much to recommend it except that the puppets used in the opening and closing credits were phenomenally lifelike and beautiful avoid this movie like the plague that it is br br
<START> two city guys are driving through hicksville usa when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly attempts to run them off the road having picked up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker they pull up at a truck stop full of redneck amputees one of whom warns them of 'the demon out there' but they don't listen big mistake monster man by michael davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well the film borrows heavily from duel the blair witch project jeepers creepers and the texas chainsaw massacre the story is pretty silly but there is enough gore and violence to keep splatter freaks happy i enjoyed especially the performance of justin urich which offers the film its comedy relief still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive give this one a chance if you have some time to waste 7 out of 10 did i mention that aimee brooks is sexy
<START> first things first how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this i saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head what exactly is director trying to say br br if its a thriller there are no thrills if its action there is no action barring a chase sequence there is no drama and the much touted love story it actually never takes off no passion emotion nothing is there br br actually i never expected wonders from the movie however after the bumper opening it took i thought of giving it a chance i have no problems with himesh whatsoever and i am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity i went in with an open mind and came out with a closed one br br let's not put the blame of himesh he is just a debutant actor but direction screenplay writing makeup everything has gone for a toss br br himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve he can do the don kind of roles is just a kid and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks br br the only actor who was good was the friend of himesh in the movie i don't know his name but he looks promising br br watch it at your own risk not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing br br strongly recommend to avoid this movie
<START> unconditional love starts with great promise as directed by p j hogan the film works great up until the last third of the movie when it falls flat on its face the screen play mr hogan and jocelyn wrote showed a myriad of possibilities that fizzle at the end it appears the artistic team behind the movie had great hopes for it to play differently the reality is this is a film that is looking in different directions in how to bring it to a resolution that ultimately fails don't get me wrong the movie is tremendously appealing and will resonate with a lot of its viewing public br br based on the strong cast we decided to take a look the tremendously talented kathy bates is the perfect choice to play grace beasley the woman who finds at the beginning of the film that all is not well in her marriage ms bates is an excellent actress who deserved much better even when her character is not helped by what the authors have her do in the film br br rupert everett is always dependable into delivering his role as the late victor fox's lover is well written that is until dirk is lured into coming to chicago to find victor's murderer it's bizarre and it defies all rules of logic dirk doesn't look capable of hurting a fly let alone hunt down a killer with the help of grace and her daughter in law the incredible funny br br as played by meredith eaton this little woman is one of the best things in the film she's is brash and tells it as she sees it peter sarsgaard one of the best actors working in films these days has nothing to do in the picture he is totally wasted dan aykroyd also has nothing to do we see him at the beginning and at the end of the film and his max doesn't make sense he appears to want changes in his life and his marriage only to come back to grace without any explanation all things forgiven br br the english actors are good lynn redgrave has a better opportunity as the hysterical jonathan pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing bland songs julie andrews makes a funny contribution in a couple of priceless scenes br br ultimately the television show hosted by sally jesse raphael is a turn off and doesn't add anything to the movie the best part is hearing kathy bates singing what a beautiful voice she has in fact ms bates is the best excuse for staying until the end
<START> why do people make bad movies didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point there is something about this picture that threw me off besides the fact that i found this movie to be unrealistic pathetic and poorly acted i admire them for the try but the actors in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent this movie deserves zero stars but i did not have that option so it gets a 1
<START> i sort of liked this columbo movie its atmosphere which was real thriller like and its approach even at times reminded me of film noir in the movie its first 30 minutes or so it's really nice and done in a good old fashioned way with the right camera angles and use of light it doesn't mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late columbo movie entry it's definitely a better movie than the average columbo movie entry br br 26 years after his previous columbo movie appearance george hamilton returns once again to play the main lead opposite peter falk again as the murderer in a total different and new role of course i liked him in his role and he was a good columbo who gave the good old lieutenant some good competition they had some nice sequences together problem with the 'modern' new columbo movies always sort of had been that it didn't feature a good well known actor opposite peter falk this movie obviously doesn't suffer from this problem but i must say though that this movie doesn't feature peter falk at this best he has certainly played the character better and his performance isn't quite consistent enough within this movie which is probably also due to he movie its director daryl duke who also directed the really dreadful movie tai pan among many other projects br br it has a rather good and enjoyable story but the fact that the same sort of plot to cover up the murder had been used before in an earlier columbo movie also doesn't help of course it got used before in the 1975 movie columbo playback nevertheless it of course also still has plenty enough 'original' moments of its own with its story even though of course in essence every columbo movie is more or less the same but oh well that is what made the columbo series so great and consistent if it ain't broke don't fix it br br it also is true that within this movie more clues than usual are left out for the lieutenant which doesn't mean that the movie its murderer is more stupid or sloppy but i more see it as the writers being more overly enthusiastic than others it doesn't make the movie or story bad and it in fact perhaps even makes it more enjoyable to see columbo hard at work and discovering all kind of small but important clues luckily the movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective relieving columbo comedy br br simply a good late columbo movie entry br br 7 10
<START> i was born in '68 with not much parental guidance as far as what i watched on tv as a kid in the 70's i always loved this movie and the french connection and would always try to catch it whenever it was on checking the sunday tv guide ahead of time i bought it on dvd a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and i must say i still love it roy s was a great actor from the 70's jaws is one of my all time marathon man etc and although the 7 ups is not an oscar worthy film it puts you precisely in a time a place ny early 70's as did french connection and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time and yes the car chase is one of the all time best
<START> this is screamingly funny well except when bruce is in the hospital scene which is a little sad br br ted raimi and stacy keach are both excellent and worth watching br br sure it's not a big budget suit controlled blockbuster but it's everything it promises to be and more and btw the women are wonderful in their parts though i don't know them from other movies i'd welcome seeing them again br br the two brain walking scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for bruce's outstanding physical comedy he is one yummy guy br br thanks bruce for your brain this is your baby
