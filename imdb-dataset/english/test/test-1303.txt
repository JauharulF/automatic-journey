<START> sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind house party 4 down to the last minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off this final installment to the house party series is by far the worst not just sequel but film released by hollywood it becomes very apparent early on in this feature that director chris loved ferris bueller's day off with a passion i say this because it becomes very clear that had no trouble lifting the originality of bueller off john hughes' hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor you would think that by stealing themes and images from a funnier film your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two with house party 4 proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel much less a hollywood film from his confusing and choppy story the inability to make sense of his characters and recycled old tired clichÃ© moments all is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the house party films it reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue macaroni cat hair chewing gum and straws and presents it as hannibal crossing the alps it just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator br br so where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity honestly i do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long so instead i would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest to begin i still cannot shake the ferris rip off it was as if director was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to house party and decided to bring in a completely random formula from a funnier film and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula that was a huge mistake when a director tries to do this what eventually happens is confusion within the audience we think that we are going in one direction but instead we head in another one that is exactly what you can witness in house party 4 in one instance we have john john trying to have the biggest party of the decade while also trying to score a record deal ok kinda reminds me of the original house party but then we whisk away to this random island where uncle charles is afraid of flying grandma gets drunk and some idiotic mind dulling moments with a supposed killer again we begin somewhat strong and end chaotic this is the confusion in which i speak director did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story he would rather cut corners keep the jokes cheap and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone dead series one would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another house party film he would walk into it thinking that he she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life instead just wanted to get paid br br i realize that i am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by but i do believe i still keep my hand in the younger generation's culture i listened to rap and r b growing up but the group immature never made it to either my cassette deck or my cd player why i don't think they ever quite had a following but apparently to director chris it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new house party film didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly or how about the option to have himself play the comedic car repairman nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor it was one of those few instances when i actually missed robin harris and i never thought i would find myself saying that to any film outside of a go nowhere band playing the lead role i also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film uncle charles was annoying when he attempted humor kim was completely wasted for her scenes both literally and figuratively while Â well Â everyone else pretty much falls into that category br br where did chris spend most of the budget for this film not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some there were definitely none present at the unforgettable house party nor the possible dream that perhaps kid or play would make one final appearance house party 4 followed no preset design which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed driver routine for humor was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance for once i can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film house party 4 buried the series and while i do hear that there may be more in the pipeline i only hope hollywood realizes that this series has died hollywood needs to let this series end forget about the past and move forward in the future i think a sequel to who's the man would get them started in the right direction br br grade out of
<START> when i saw this on tv i was nervous whats if they messed it up millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man in my case my dad would be let down i watched it with my mum and we both ended up crying it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury the actors were all wonderful and i had no complaints my mums told me she hasn't been able to stop thinking about it i hope this program made many people aware of what it's like living with brain damage and what it's like for the families more programs like this should be made i was surprised at how good it was and it's really shook me up emotionally
<START> wow this movie was horrible as a bills fan i was really looking forward to it but this was bad they should have left it on the shelf it was on for 4 years i can't believe a guy like jon voight would sign on for something like this
<START> on the way home from a day at the beach four young people seek shelter from a torrential downpour at the home of lord and lady alexander after their car runs out of gas they don't know it but the house they're staying in is to be the site of a satanic ritual jane camille keaton the only female of the group is to be sacrificed as her male companions rush to her aid one of them accidentally kills lady alexander things really get out of hand and everyone else attending the black mass is also killed the four try to make an escape but soon discover there's no escape from what they've witnessed one by one they meet their fates br br gong into tragic ceremony i was positive i would enjoy it slow burn gothic horror is right up my alley i'm also quite fond of some of riccardo other movies like the horrible dr the ghost and i tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing unfortunately things don't always work out the way they should the biggest tragedy with respect to tragic ceremony is the time i spent watching this mess of a movie with a few minor exceptions nothing about the film appealed to me or worked for me the characters are unlikeable the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic and the pacing is terrible there's a subplot about some cursed pearls that goes nowhere and only serves to confuse things even further in addition nothing interesting happens for most of the movie by the time the four leads realize they're in danger i was well past the point of caring and i don't understand the reviews i've read that praise the acting of camille keaton i suppose it's a terrific performance if you consider an emotionless daze to be acting the three male leads are the very definition of nondescript they do nothing to stand out the supporting cast includes some genre favorites like luigi pistilli luciana paluzzi and paul muller but none is given anything to do in fact muller's main contribution is a two minute long monologue at the end of the movie that attempts to explain what happened in the previous 80 or so minutes it's a weak attempt to provide a wrap up to a very weak movie
<START> this is a novelty in danish film the mood is not unlike that of also by anders thomas jensen but with a novel touch one difference is fewer characters leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into and what characters the two butchers are perfect mads is a dominating deranged parody and nikolaj lie an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two
<START> although i'm a girl thankfully i have a sense of humor and realize that this really is a funny anime watching it does give you an overwhelming feeling that it's definitely a guy show but that doesn't take away from the fact that its hilarious 10 10
<START> this film is definetly fonda's best film the plot is amazing the acting is amazing and the directing is amazing an all time classic this should have won best picture not kramer vs kramer though it was not even nominated jack lemmon and micheal douglas are also at their best one of the best endings ever if you haven't seen this film run don't walk to rent it should have been on afi's top 100 see it not just for fonda but for everything br br out of 4 out of 4
<START> i feel very generous giving this movie a 2 out of 10 okay noted that the special effects are 'okay' and renny harlin did make one my favorite genetically altered sharks attack a research station movie that of which you may know as deep blue sea also the opening credits are done fairly well with a remix of more human then and it does go fairly well with what is in the context of this 'movie' but enough praise lets get to the reason why this movie sucks so much br br not since uwe boll's alone in the dark did i ever feel that the special effects in a movie were totally wasted okay our story starts with four guys who are descendants of four different families each of which possess a never fully explained power from a never fully explained family background that did a never fully explained art of witch craft oh and for some reason these descendants are all 17 all go to the same school are all on the swim team and all for some reason or another sit in bed with their shirts off sweating and talking to each other on the phone i have nothing against gays gothic or thirteen year old's but that is what this movie is aimed at 13 year old goth who question their sexuality yeah there's girls in it who sit on their beds in their panties or whatever but how come they don't take their shirts off hey its only fair br br anyways the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18 they will ascend and be granted new profound almost god like powers but before i go any further i forgot to mention that when they use their powers they age slowly and they grow more addicted to it that explains why they got people in their late 20's to play 17 year old's oh and if something needs explaining don't worry someone will explain it all in one large piece of dialog god this movie sucks where was i oh yeah the ascension part br br okay apparently there was a super secret alpha one family that the others forgot about or some s t like that i don't know i was dozing off at this point but they were written out some how and the new kid at school who is befriending the group is one of these descendants from the fifth family and i say because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy he has greater power then the others because he's older i think anyways bob say it out loud things happen and we get to the final fight in the movie br br to be honest i was all game for a witch battle you know like vs gandalf or anything along the lines with magic battle because you know this is about witches and stuff now when these two witches throw down its more of like how can i put it a very very crappy version of a dragonball z type battle they throw stuff at each other talk throw stuff talk throw stuff talk etc when i say 'throw stuff' i only say that because i have no clue what the f k their throwing at each other it looks like big gobs of slimy water god this movie sucks anyways when our main witch he doesn't get very powerful at all he just throws bigger gobs of slimy water things happen and it ends in a way that you as the viewer know its gonna end the good witch wins bad witch loses br br you know how shitty a movie is when the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as 'i'm gonna make you my thats where i wanted to punch myself in the face for sitting through this whole thing br br yes i admit the thought of witches doing battle using powers in the modern day does sound kinda cool but when the execution is this bad i really wished they didn't make this movie maybe if it was r rated had and threw in more deaths with a dash of gore it might have worked might have worked br br if your interested in watching this don't buy it or even rent it wait for it to come on tv or borrow it from your sucker of a friend who bought it just don't waste your time with this hack of a movie if you spend any money on it there's a good chance your putting an effort towards a sequel to be made by uwe boll called the covenant 2 alone in the dark with the house of the dead
<START> i am a big follower of indian movies especially malayalam and tamil br br shame on india for not sending this movie as their official oscar entry i have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with by the way to all we westerners tamil cinema is more qualitative and very different from bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion br br coming to the point what was india thinking when they sent a movie like to the oscars that was a really a masochist move i think they are trying to punish oscar judges with boredom by sending devdas since the judges toppled lagaan last year br br is just a colored but stale and predictable melodrama of love fate and destiny i would keep away from it anyway not sending a movie like shows how much of a revamp indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence now i know why this country has so many issues they are heavily talented but not showcased properly
<START> this film is great being a fan of the comic strip presents i just knew i would love this film and love it i do i finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year however i was annoyed to find that it had been cut so i'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version br br anyway the film is about dennis carter adrian who tries to impress his girlfriend dawn french by claiming to be a drug dealer however dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked so dennis turns but the trouble is he doesn't know anything and starts to make up lies and dig himself into an even deeper hole the irony of all this is that there is drug smuggling going on down in devon br br this film is not as funny as i expected but it is still a really good film with some good laughs and a great soundtrack it also has the best scene ever in a british film robbie coltrane's walk across the pier set to two tribes by frankie goes to hollywood br br so if you are a fan of the comic strip presents of any of the cast members or a fan of british comedy see it a s a p
<START> this obviously was a pretty low budget production but the cast was pretty decent the basic premise had promise and something more could have been done with it but the script wasn't that great the plot is incoherent and seems almost random at times and the dialog is stilted and terrible br br basically a girl's father gets whacked by fellow gangsters and later she becomes a robber and wants to avenge his death and then it goes into a mob protection racket involving corrupt politicians br br alan ladd gets top billing but he really plays a very minor role br br i have to say i found it mildly entertaining in its archaic b grade but it really is shoddy and pathetic
<START> i've always loved gone with the wind and have seen it numerous times however its ending left me not only hanging but depressed with a hopeless feeling finally in scarlett ripley took us to a very plausible and satisfying end beginning of the original story br br it follows that someone of scarlett's obvious intelligence as originally written would eventually grow up although like most people i fell in love with scarlett in gwtw i tired of her constant insipid to the point of exasperation and i was disappointed that mitchell did not show scarlett using that obvious intelligence to even make an attempt to grow emotionally thankfully someone finally did after all isn't that nagging immaturity that conflicted with her beauty and intelligence the very reason rhett finally gave up on her in the first place i think ripley did an excellent job of describing that long overdue process and whalley kilmer did a superb job of portraying it joanne w k has all the fire exuberance and intelligent sparkle as did vivian leigh and she is certainly at least as if not more beautiful br br there was is and always will be only one clark gable however if i had to pick an actor out of the thousands to which i've been exposed to portray him in his biography it would definitely be timothy dalton dalton possesses the same elegant charm that gable did which is essential for character i can't imagine anyone else who could come close br br in my opinion both joanne whalley kilmer and timothy dalton were superbly cast and the only actors who could have possibly played scarlett and rhett i think both their performances did justice to not only the late actors but also the spirit of their characters br br i enjoyed the whole cast julie harris was her usual delightful presence and jean smart was an adorable kick even ashley's character was nicely played by stephen collins and the progression of his relationship with scarlett was totally believable br br the story became a little convoluted in ireland but so is life after all and i still found it entertaining br br all in all i thoroughly enjoyed the fruits of ripley's imagination i wish i'd written it br br
<START> wow this movie is amazing it is such an excellent film has some sick scenes not nearly as sick as terror firmer or citizen toxie some nudity and this was the penis monster's debut on film this has set the scene for many of troma's movies this is a very film it mixes comedy romance and my favorite horror gore not that much gore in this flick but enough to satisfy this is the best adaption of shakespeare's romeo and juliet much better than any other version they make it so entertaining and fun to watch and we have debbie rochon hehe i like her all i have to say is this is a great film very funny and is a good host for it the acting is good and kaufman directs stylishly as always must see for all troma fans
<START> we'll never know the truth about 9 11 and this shoddy movie proves it br br i recently watched a youtube report claiming there were no planes involved in the twin towers' destruction that all the news programs were supposedly provided with same angle shots of the towers from a mysterious source probably the and in that provided footage cgi planes were substituted for real life missiles which actually hit the towers br br it's a compelling video and though i am not a wacko conspiracy theorist per se i am still not sure myself whether actual planes hit anything that day the towers the field the pentagon because there is no plane wreckage available and what about those infamous black boxes none recovered a million other theories abound all of them courting a droplet of truth awash in an ocean of speculation but you'll drown in malarkey before you find anything truthful or worth speculating about in the 9 11 commission report a no budget movie that is trying to close the barn door after all the horses and jihadists have escaped br br writer director leigh scott is obviously a concerned american citizen who wanted to enlighten audiences on what the page report might reveal it would help if his movie had actors instead of a guy who looks like david duchovny a chick who looks like gina gershon a guy who thinks he's russell crowe and another guy who i'm pretty sure is trying hard to be sean bean it would help if his camera operator didn't have if the lighting director wasn't trying to save on electricity it would help if his editor didn't have attention deficit disorder or if the soundtrack wasn't some tuneless new world order and the looping should have probably been inserted when people were actually moving their mouths br br we can't even call this propaganda it's too funny and by funny i mean unwatchable br br you can't squeeze an issue this complex into a two hour film but leigh scott tries anyway including all those sexy catch phrases we've grown to bin intent to attack purchasing weapons from non aggression agreement with iraq attending flight school weapons of mass destruction br br the problem is we know it's all retrospect so every discussion the concerned intelligence operatives have with each other reeks of fake hindsight all crammed into a neat conversation like contrived reverse engineering everything pertinent is mentioned succinctly so that we can shake our heads in wonder at how incompetently all these branches of government screwed up br br there's a ludicrous interrogation scene with a lubricious bimbo beating up on a guy with tomato sauce on his face now that would be considered torture if most guys didn't consider it a turn on br br the tagline is what if the attack could have been stopped by this movie's account and we presume according to the commission report the cia and other underground agencies were all set to capture bin laden and didn't everyone involved with the terrorism reports you mean you actually read these reports is so concerned we just want to slap them for their bad acting br br yet the whole story goes so much deeper than the banal the negligent ku bush klan foisted on the american people after 9 11 we now know that even capturing bin laden before the 9 11 attack would not have changed or achieved anything the wheels were in motion with or without that taliban figurehead whose involvement was the possible figment of someone's fevered imagination to unite america against a common enemy contrary to popular belief they didn't attack us as ron paul tried to elucidate it was a case of middle eastern blowback they were so sick of america planting their infidel feet over there that they brought the war over here so though george w death likes to tout the nonsensical we're fighting them over there so we won't have to fight them over here in reality because we're over there the fight has been brought over here br br the 9 11 attack was not so much about the intricate planning of terrorists as it was the gross negligence of the bush administration who we know without the probing of commissions had all the intel from the clinton administration onwards information about terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intent to cause chaos but the oil idiot of texas who refused to read his daily and would rather vacation at his crawford ranch than spend one extra day at work the duty he swore an oath to perform protect the american public br br and then the scum who called himself president used the attacks brought about by his negligence as a political hammer against his own dumbed down countryfolk to score a second term shred the american constitution and take america into a fake war on the basis of a lie wmd with a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks strangely enough the movie never treads near the ku bush klan offering no opinion or judgment leigh scott wanting to remain neutral tell that to the raped and pillaged hundreds of thousands in the fake war on terror in iraq br br out of pure coincidence i realized i was watching this dvd while wearing my bush lied thousands died t shirt
<START> i picked this up because having spent time in the albany region of new york i knew a couple of people in the movie and i happened upon it by chance the attempts at comedy are lame the compulsory girl on girl scene is sickening the plot is nonexistent the acting is among the worst i've ever seen and don't even get me started on special effects i realize this is a very low budget film made by a small independent company but if you're going to do a sci fi horror flick with giant bugs don't make the giant bugs completely unbelievable people want to see giant bugs that's half the fun right there and if you're going to make the giant bugs completely unbelievable at least get the actors to make some sort of tongue in cheek allusion to that fact you idiots these aren't them you've captured their stunt doubles be prepared to waste two hours of your life that you'll never be able to get back
