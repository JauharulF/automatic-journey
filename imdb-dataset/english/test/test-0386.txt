<START> american war movie fans might be bored out of their skulls by this movie but that boredom is born of ignorance guerrilla suppression operations are always like that sit around and wait get some hookers get drunk at the base wheel and deal with the businessman kick a prisoner around cover up the killing of the street merchant by the green private then boom there goes two fuel trucks and for 10 minutes a small arms battle with one high caliber machine gun then wait for brass to plan a way to knock out their stronghold and then end up killing a few civilians in the process of doing it if reality doesn't work for western viewers there's always top gun or rambo top gun realistic nope br br the best part of realism was the way all the planes dropped flares like confetti they had to do that because carter and reagan gave the mujahedin so many missiles also the wave of mi was excellent a better helo attack even than apocalypse now the sight of their missiles dropping and shooting was a scene of impending death from above for whoever they were aimed at br br it's funny how the soviets were able to make an honest afghanistan movie within a year after their departure but it took the us six years is just as real if you apply it to occupation too someone will always pick up the gun and shoot you cause they care more about the land it's a movie westerners should watch unfortunately i don't think anyone has ever made english subtitles i might have to make some
<START> my giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature length films from 1930 by the standards of films made just a few years later this film might receive a score of only 6 or 7 mostly because the sound quality was so poor now it is possible that the film sounded better and the fox movie channel did show a degraded print it did have a lot of lines and scratches but i assume the sound problem was always an issue that's because sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the hollywood talking pictures of 1930 sounded terrible with background characters often drowning out the leads characters huddled together to make sure they are picked up by the microphones or inconsistent quality such as what was seen in the bishop murder case hell's angels and other films of the day this was all made much worse in the big trail because most of the film was shot outside something unheard of at the time quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians so while the film was very hard to listen to i realize that they had to start somewhere so i can forgive this especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking a major innovation for 1930 br br the plot is rather similar to cimarron a western that came out the following year and which captured the oscar for best picture unfortunately cimarron isn't all that great a film and i actually like the big trail more due to the scope of the film while some might balk at the big slow moving pace i saw it as a great history lesson about the hardships endured by those traveling west on wagon trains plus the whole thing just looked so beautiful as director raoul walsh went to significant trouble to film on location and the big trail looks almost like a film version of some adams prints br br as for the acting it was pretty good this was a major break for young john wayne as his previous screen appearances were at best minor and unremarkable here he was given the lead and did a dandy job though he was obviously young and a little less john wayne ish than he was in later films as his screen persona was not yet firmly established another interesting part was played by tyrone power ii tyrone power's father he looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like bluto from the popeye cartoons he made very few sound films dying just a year after making this film so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor br br overall the film is well worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few overly long scenes here and there for 1930 it was a remarkable achievement more so than the much more famous and award winning cimarron made the following year much of the reason the big trail didn't win an oscar most likely was because all quiet on the western front came out the same year and it is truly one of the great films
<START> once upon a time way back in the 1940's there lived an actress named veronica lake a beautiful talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big budget hollywood pictures fast forward to the late 1960's age alcoholism and all around bad luck has tarnished everyones favorite actress now a miss lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers joan crawford and bette davis and fall back on good ol' reliable horror but flesh feast really she couldn't have possibly been that washed up to put it delicately flesh feast is a lifeless pile garbage possibly one of the top 5 worst films i've ever seen and i've seen them all lake plays a scientist who is plotting with nazi's to bring hitler back to life with youth restoration experiments involving maggots that's right maggots unless you're a huge fan of heather hughes run away and never look back br br i know very little about this veronica lake person as well as 40's flicks but to think that such a successful career actually became that dismal is actually pretty sad flesh feast is almost impossible to get through and by almost i mean absolutely directed by brad director of nudist camp pictures and the man who coincidentally brought us the greatest b movie ever made blood freak just a couple years later one has to wonder is this what blood freak would have been like if hadn't co directed with steve hawkes if so then god bless steve hawkes you wouldn't think that a religious dope blood craving turkey monster could be that much better than experiments involving maggots and hitler but it really really is so forget you ever heard of this one and go find blood freak it's just waiting to entertain you fast forward a couple years later veronica lake dies of broke and forgotten the end i hate you flesh feast 1 10
<START> just saw this film at and was floored i've never been a huge fan of scratching but this film had me hooked from the getgo it's listed as a documentary but never really felt like one can't remember the last time i had so much fun watching a documentary it has a style and an energy that is refreshing insightful and never too preachy the production values were up there too shot on film with cool cuts and an amazing soundtrack overall a smart entertaining and enlightening piece
<START> chop shop the second feature from ramin is a rare breed it is an american film that tells a story not usually found in american cinema the story of the of a minority living in poverty it is a work of simple beauty shot on location in queens new york in the shadows of shea stadium chop shop is neo realism to the core featuring a cast of non actors it has more in common with vittorio de sica's classic bicycle thieves than anything made in the united states there is no score or soundtrack all the music and sounds are diagetic watching it feels like watching a great foreign film it takes us to another world because it is so uncommon to see however this other world is not post world war ii rome or istanbul or new delhi it is contemporary new york city br br tells the story of alejandro alejandro better known as ale he is a 12 year old latin american kid with no parents or family unit to watch after him he lives in a tiny room upstairs in the auto shop that he also works at he shares the same bed with his teenage sister gonzales neither of them have made it passed second grade ale though young is tough and mature he acts as the head of the small family he hooks his sister up with a job and he himself does anything he can to make a buck when not working at the chop shop he sells bootleg dvds on the streets and candy in subways he searches for scrap auto parts and sells them to the many auto shops lining the street where he lives br br alejandro is heartbroken when he learns his sister is working nights as a prostitute he himself becomes progressively disinterested in abiding by the law he begins to steal first car parts and later wallets like antonio the desperate protagonist in bicycle thieves we cannot blame ale for becoming a thief it is merely survival ale and save up in hopes of buying a food vending van for 4 500 they see the van as their way out and there is much optimism however as is usually the case in neo realism we know this will only lead to disappointment br br riveting performance is what gives legitimacy to chop shop's realism here is a 12 year old character that needs to be believably independent and vulnerably naive whether he is directing cars to the shop selling movies and snickers bars or playing with his sister in their scanty room it is authentic br br chop shop is a sobering reminder that not all american children grow up in a land of opportunity lifestyle is what many in middle class white america consider world' they act cognizant the poverty and deprivation in foreign lands while sipping their coffee and reading the new york times on sunday morning but make themselves blind to it on their own streets once you watch chop shop you will think differently of the kids candy on the subway br br more reviews at www com
<START> this film is about a party put together by the high school scary girl per the illogic of these sorts of films she gets permission to hold the party at a house which used to be a crematorium a dubious place long shut down and locked up apparently the history of this piece of property is one of those town secrets best left unspoken of among proper folk though the legend does get whispered about among the young br br why was this crematorium really shut down what actually happened there in the past br br i like these kill kill kill films of a supernatural nature as long as there is something in them not copied from a hundred other films the highlights of this film are a petty theft 7 11 robbery by distracting the clerk with a vivid view the changing clothes scene by the good girl witnessed by her jerk younger brother the eventual demise of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water being a barrier against the supernatural the best part of this film is when the possessed party sponsor dances to bauhaus in front of the fireplace that scene rocks
<START> charles chaplin's of 1918 was his longest film to date though at just over 45 minutes in length it was not quite a feature film with world war one just drawing to a close many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops and chaplin was no exception and so the lovable tramp went to war the film begins with the tramp in training and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills including marching and gun slinging much to the disgust of his drill sergeant the tramp then finds himself in the trenches faced with a more formidable foe though the germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he the uproarious moment when the tramp declares that he single handedly captured thirteen german soldiers by surrounding them had me in stitches br br there are plenty of other great moments in this film chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface br br however the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree the reactions of the bumbling german soldiers unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy as they are single handedly disabled one by one are highly amusing especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood br br this is a very enjoyable film and one of the best of chaplin's pre 1920 efforts highly recommended
<START> i see that the majority of the comments so far have been if not overly positive then at least positive i can not understand that the only explanation i can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the film because this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen it makes boggy creek ii and mutant look like masterpieces of horror the acting is shaky at best and awful for the most part the entire movie is almost pitch black probably so they could shoot it all in the same location the monster looks like something from one of roger corman's worst films and the plot well the less said about it the better br br one to avoid at all costs
<START> i thought the movie was great i thought kristine debell was great and was glad to see her move on into some more interesting roles i even overlook the fact that the print i have wasn't quite put back together correctly but who cares
<START> cute movie feel good movie i had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to rent i had high hopes for this movie based purely on flex being in this movie i have never seen him in anything not worth while true to form this movie delivered for me i enjoyed the story the movie is full of great actors and actresses the hilarious tasha smith essence atkins and of course miller i really liked this movie a lot i didn't give it five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that i thought the movie should have detailed the issue was apparently resolved but i would have appreciated a discussion resolving the issues i liked the movie so much that i am now buying the movie after i've already rented and watched it
<START> maybe here in sydney we are all poop side down and as a result we get to lap up like this s eek in classy theaters released here in 1980 this hilarious all tar drama was greeted with howls of delight at the session i attended in fact the audience were so into the ludicrous antics on screen it played like a rocky horror session within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real disaster the tug boat scene where you can see the buckets of water tossed in from off set after that it was every patron for himself and the cinema rang with advice cheering for bad acting and oo reactions the gunfight in the hold among the crates is especially idiotic and allows drunken viewers with friends in altered states also watching to contribute appropriately i call these films with michael caine his holiday house films as i always reckon he agrees to do them because he has seen a house he likes and doesn't want to spend his savings like jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called
<START> around 1980 the name godfrey ho was attached to a series of low comedy action films starring an actor with the unlikely name elton chong although no masterworks of the genre they remain surprisingly entertaining films for those with a high tolerance for silliness br br it is altogether unclear why ho or whomever would want to make a film that would attack jackie chan's drunken master the film that legitimated the making of comedy action films in hong kong but that's what this is a savage attack on the chan film the imitation chan who stars in this movie learns to cause his opponents to laugh themselves to death a pointless gimmick in any genre br br along with all the flaws one expects from a godfrey ho film of this period no continuity no motivation incomprehensible plot line irrelevant and unbelievable characters the film suffers from two unforgivable faults that effectively make it unwatchable the fight scenes stink and the comedy isn't funny br br pointless
<START> is an awful movie the script the story the acting are all simply laughable dino plays a man who pays emraan hashmi to seduce his wife yes this is as ridiculous as it sounds both and hashmi offer incredibly and unsurprisingly bad acting plays the aggressive capricious and angry wife she is good looking but has zero acting talent the film has one hit song called which is composed and sung by himesh reshammiya i never could understand the hype around this song as i never found it particularly good though it is catchy the film is supposed to be a thriller but instead it just looks like a comic strip thanks to the terrible direction and writing avoid this cheapo at any cost
<START> the of this movie is maddening one moment it's making fun of latin americans american tourists and banana republics in general the other it wants to be touching with burned villages and orphans even the serious revolutionary hero becomes a parody of a revolutionary at one point but the comedy parts aren't even funny because it's so obviously stolen from star wars yes star wars the hero is basically a rogue with a heart of gold add to this stereotypical sounds effects latin americans who speak english with one another and a villain that just disappears from the story and whats the point it's basically revolution propaganda with no resolution and no planning because there is just no way these people can lead a country the us government are bad guys but who'll make money producing this not some poor farmer that's for sure
<START> it's true that this is not realistic story but romantic comedy is not a genre that i look to for realism what counts is that the characters are likeable and as needed sexy shalom is beautiful and relaxed and jake weber is handsome in an offhand kind of way they have enough chemistry to make the story believable in the area that counts sexual attraction i would love to see either of them in another movie and yes the clown is pretty cute too
