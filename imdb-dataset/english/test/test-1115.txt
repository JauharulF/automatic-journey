<START> i saw this film last night and came online specifically to see if others thought it was as awful as i did br br granted obviously some people see a lot in this film that i didn't so if you're one of those people fine good luck to you but i'm a patient person i've enjoyed extremely long films before but this was an exercise in torture for me br br i honestly felt that this was one of those films with little to say and that it was more about style than substance however the style too made me feel like tearing my hair out pretty much anything interesting that happens during the course of the film happens off screen it's like a deliberate attempt to make a film entirely from outtakes the bits that would usually be reserved for the deleted scenes section of a dvd if they were shown to the public at all br br you don't even get to find out in the end anything about the main character francois i had no sympathy for any of the characters in this film except perhaps the violinist his goat and the old man who believes that octopuses live to 300 because they're really smart seriously i was excited when it cut to a shot of francois holding a gun to his head i felt so ripped off when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be gut wrenchingly boring br br oh and where was the editor off smoking opium too i swear i almost screamed every time i was subjected to an extended shot of absolutely nothing happening except perhaps someone pacing backwards and forwards and then finally there would be a very abrupt cut to the next scene and it would be a year later and we'd missed everything interesting that happened in the meantime and everyone was still wearing the same bloody clothes br br so in conclusion if you liked it great but this review is intended as an antidote to the fawning you'll love this film if you love cinema dross i've seen posted here and elsewhere see i hated the film and i still included a sly winking reference to its content
<START> you have to acknowledge cimino's contribution to cinema he gave us both the most over rated film in history the deer hunter and the worst film in history heaven's gate and before you start with the 'it's bad but not the worst ever' let me explain br br for 20 years i listened to the critics and avoided heaven's gate actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film then a few days after seeing the 'final cut the making and of heaven's documentary i stumbled on a used 9 99 dvd of the long version my advice after minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film you will find a wide selection and imagine that the reviewer is cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie then you will have an idea of just how big a mess cimino made br br while pretty much everything is wrong with this film what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever and a classic 'less than example is its shameless distortion of history although the association did send a group of gunmen to johnson county and did have a list of targeted names the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated on the morning of april 9 1892 nick ray and nate champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and texas hired guns who had come to johnson county to clean out rustlers the citizens of the county then besieged the who finally were arrested or rescued by the army women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from ray and champion there were minimal casualties after all these were not assaults and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the of regulations early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the indians and weeks prior to the arrival of the a number of johnson county residents were hanged without trial including jim the keeper of a modest road ranch and his wife ella watson who cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows living to a ripe old age br br there is no movie making sin greater than fictionalizing history if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal perhaps it is harsh to blame cimino for his distortion of history he could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense the film provides plenty of support if cimino was insane during the production of heaven's gate it would explain a lot of things but my vote goes to of directing talent' instead of insanity br br there are some good things about heaven's gate you can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went expensive sets beautiful epic camera shots artful dance sequences isabelle huppert a strange casting choice that actually worked gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters the dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary br br but don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant like explosions of communal action this implies that there was a method to cimino madness is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible the simple fact is that there is no evidence cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization what it looks like is that he just turned his dp loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots 1 5 million feet of loosely staged scenes then he tried without success to pare this down and fit everything together in post production br br the final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as wearing perhaps borrowed from a 'fiddler on the roof' touring company throw countless sticks of dynamite at the unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly after you see this happen 50 60 times you can relate to the woman the one who looks like something out of 'the grapes of who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger this is probably what cimino's mother did after writing that review br br so believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980 it is a sloppy disconnected poorly paced and historically distorted mess of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the american west
<START> when i went to see this movie it was already a forced choice as my original intent was sold out what then was sheer terror this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it the story is not worth mention a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who on discovering his sexual orientation gave him a hard time loaded with unbearably old and overused clichÃ©s of gays the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues it is absolutely astonishing that actors as or charly waste their talent and time on such nonsense 1 10
<START> in fact the nature of the whole series is funny but not always funny there are moments of extreme poignance as the deeper aspects of human emotion are touched on br br over and again the series comments on the frailties of human nature and the life long or in this case eternal struggle to overcome them monkey is both smart and stupid at the same time his arrogance and reliance on his own martial skills lead him into trouble in almost every episode is just plain gross sandy has a philosophical turn of mind he has many of the wittiest lines br br the english translation is a delight ignorance can always be improved upon sandy in his laid back manner but you can't do anything to help stupidity who are you the group of travellers are asked we three kings of orient are says monkey br br this is not just for children it is a magical romp for anyone who can suspend reality
<START> i got a chance to see this movie at an early screening in brea and i have been crazy for it ever since the film is based on shakespeare's twelfth night which i have read and loved and seen on stage a few times so i certainly liked the references but whether you like shakespeare or not it won't matter the movie stands on it's on it is super funny witty and charming amanda bynes is hilarious and so was david cross actually the whole cast is great i just happen to be a huge david cross fanatic the cast is hot and the soundtrack kicks lots of cool bands and a few i hadn't heard before but i know they have a cd coming out so i will definitely buy it everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish all age groups
<START> after going to sleep out of sheer loneliness lestat wakes from a 100 year sleep to the sounds of a new music he wants to be a part of and the band the vampire lestat is born his longing to end his loneliness and his living in the light attitude along with his music anger his fellow vampires and awaken an evil that has been slumbering for thousands of years br br this film is not for those looking for a true book to film adaptation those who have read the books and expect to see it on the screen are in for a huge disappointment this film will appeal to those who really enjoyed the interview with the vampire film br br there are a few plot holes and but as a whole this film was satisfying stuart townsend portrays lestat with a sensuality and sexiness lacking in the previous film the relationships portrayed in the film were very sexy and sizzling br br as a film the story compels you and draws you in casting is wonderful loved this story and film if you like simmering sensuality and sexual tension you'll love this film
<START> i think this movie lacks so much of substance it is even not worth a discussion br br in the first the package is really disgusting especially the stereotype filming and photographing surely joe dante's cinematic stile was appropriate and interesting in gremlins and small soldiers i mean the imaginative and visual pretty story telling of a spielberg wunderkind i really loved these movies but in homecoming it was a completely failure attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures is simply not comparable with zombie invasions dead stinky rotten beings trying to kill the living without any logical reason just because they hate them br br zombie flicks are characteristic in plain direct unconventional and brutal cinematography nothing to be seen in joe dante's debut another point is the annoying content really stupid dialogs between the two main characters a gruesome exploitation of the elder brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized and bad acting and by the way homecoming is neither scary nor gory and even less entertaining you see it is even not a horror movie br br zombie movies in the decade of their birth it the end of 60s start of the 70s used to be revolutionary provocative through its gruesome explicit content and of subtle social critic the original zombie film was actually a midnight movie named night of the living dead 1968 this one was a low budget movie that covered so many controversial themes it's hard to name them all a visual style of hitchcock raimi the american lifestyle of the 70s political aloofness the upcoming breakthrough of the human rights of black people and the even more upcoming racism as a result on the side of the conservative americans remember the shooting of the black main character in the end of the movie br br if you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and want to learn more about the most important ones i recommend you midnight movies from the margin to the mainstream br br so steer clear of homecoming and even so of romero's land of the dead
<START> the worst wrestlemania ever br br this had no must see bouts and many crap ones at that this took place in las vegas and wwe made it's employees dress up like egyptian gods they even changed howard name to maximus which probably doesn't mean anything the sight of seeing jim ross in that terrible gown still gives me nightmares to this day and i'm 21 years old so you could imagine it when i was 7 years old bobby was funny though br br matches included the undertaker vs giant gonzales in a p ss poor match the headshrinkers vs the steiner brothers in a useless match doink vs crush in a comedy match and a boring match featuring razor ramon vs bob hulk hogan teamed up with brutus beefcake to battle money inc you could clearly see hogan had a black eye in storyline purposes ted dibiase and irs beat up hogan while he was playing poker or something like that in the casinos which is a poor storyline but in reality macho man randy savage hit hogan because savage thinks he's like the hulk no pun intended no not the wrestler but the film character br br the main event consisted of bret hart facing off against yokozuna in a very boring main event match mr fuji threw salt in the face of hart and yoko won but not until hogan came down and squashed yoko in 21 seconds br br overall grade e
<START> uncle fred olen ray once again gives us a little of his retromedia goodness in the form of this soft core cinemax non classic br br a numb nut pair are out looking at rocks when they come across a swirling vortex a black hole as the intelligent dolts put it pretty soon an attractive cave girl from one million years ago happens into out time line and she beds her way into the future pretty soon her studly other half makes his way into the future as well and blazes a path through the beds of the future br br ray again delivers a passable but barely smut fest that has horrible acting but some decent skin yeah it's barely titillating but heh if worse comes to worse it will cure you insomnia br br reviews 1 5 or 3 10
<START> the movie is based on a jules verne book i actually have read once about ten years ago i remember i liked the book a lot and this movie does a good job in telling the story the most important thing in this movie isn't the story however but the highly original visual look it has br br the visuals are absolutely beautiful and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors stop motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie combined by jules verne's own unique versions of airplanes and submarines and karel zeman's good directing results in a very well done and convincing visual style that manages to effectively hold one's attention until the end of the movie br br there are some problems as well one of the underwater scenes at the end takes maybe needlessly lot of time for example as the story in the first part of the movie is rushed through quite quickly none of this matters much though since the movie is always highly enjoyable a gem that deserves to be more well known for today's audiences as well a recommended movie for the whole family
<START> it was high time a movie about the situation in a largely ignored asian country like had to be made and beyond is hollywood's answer initially i thought hollywood would dramatize the events of the uprising and add in the traditionally hollywood spice of titanic type love between the lead heroine and the burmese male lead who happens to be an old man thankfully nothing of that sort was in place which may also explain why the film was not financially successful br br anyway the film was honest to god and i was glad at the accuracy of events portrayed apart from the fact that filming was done outside of in malaysia thailand and that i missed the exotic burmese locales i could not find much fault in the film br br you cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions it is after all real events of a civil war the music by hans zimmer is definitely the of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it br br i was only a year old in now during this tumultuous time when i heard a movie was made on my real life experience which i was too young to absorb i had to get the dvd and needless to say i could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eye opening wonder for me
<START> i feel conflicted about this film it is one of the most beautiful films i've seen and provides insightful looks into a lost culture there was an early scene of men in caps and moustaches sitting around a table with a woman serving and an accordion playing that brought tears to my eyes just because of the way it captured a way of life that must be incomprehensible to many today it presents the lives of the characters as being inextricably bound up with the life of the village another lost concept in today's world symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little dated the fatal flaws of the movie to me were the lack of any compelling dramatic drive and a total lack of humor i never felt like i knew any of the characters beyond very basic universal things like grieving over the loss of a loved one etc the people were stick figures in the director's tableaux involving natural disasters war etc the film was just one beautiful tragic scene after another with no involving narrative thread and no humanity as a result it seemed very abstract irrelevant to the lives of real people in the end i was too bored to finish watching it
<START> so it's not an award winner so what have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly the villain and this one could top the list my husband says that jekyll and hyde together again is one of those movies that if you've been there and done that you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot i think the whole film is just fun nothing is sacred hospitals plastic surgery howard hughes there are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate to say that the film doesn't follow the book would be true but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also i recommend this movie to all the old stoners among us we may be smarter now but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew ourselves back in the old days
<START> unfortunately i think this is one of those films that if you or i took it to the studio and said 'can i make this great movie with my friends mary mungo and midge from school ' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot however if a bunch of massive hollywood names say 'look i fancy a to italy with my mates how about it ' the studio writes a cheque br br we kick off with the casino boss from ocean's 11 tracking down the robbers who made off with his cash and then brad pitt is shagging catherine zeta jones and then there's some about in amsterdam and italy and such and such and then it all ends somehow br br the film does however include the most shameful moment of both julia roberts' and bruce willis' careers which is a cinematic gem i nearly vomited in my lap and tore my eyes out when julia roberts playing tess in the movie pretends to be you guessed it julia roberts bruce willis stands about clearly wondering when he can leave and how much the cheque will be br br ah well to be fair i'd have done it for the cash so i suppose i can't really criticize the poor loves but i'm a penniless slob not a hollywood legend i guess what really annoys me about this film is not that it is boring and pointless and has a terrible story but that i think the actors probably all had good fun doing it i think the actor's entire job is to project emotion outwards i feel like i paid to go to the party but had to stand outside in the rain br br watch it if you like como or fancy or something but otherwise go for a walk
<START> this movie is bad just bad in absolute terms bad br br the dialog jumps off the screen and slugs you in the face with its thoroughly artificial banter and then defecates on your ability to detect even trace amounts of subtlety br br racism is bad racism in los angeles can be especially bad i live in the city of angels i can attest to that what is so terrible about the bigotry in los angeles is its insidious nature it creeps at you with a knowing glance or a swallowed word until just at the edge of a full on fist fight it almost never comes right out and says why did he have to be black br br i can see quite clearly that the car are black the detective's partner is hispanic the da is white as long as there is film rolling through the projector i can let the visuals music and words take me to that conclusion without just telling me the conclusion characters emote and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions br br that is a partnership and trust between filmmaker and audience that trust is raped by this movie br br a good film pulls you in directions as an audience and it steers you with cues to drive to a point this movie beats you down with its point and insults you and your intelligence along the way my unanswered question is why did we as a society say collectively thank you
