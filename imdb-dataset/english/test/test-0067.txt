<START> normally i would applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre it is obvious that this movie is some sort of parody on ninja movies and i really did my best to enjoy the movie but i just couldn't the jokes aren't funny enough i've seen my share of japanese movies and most of the times i like and understand the humor used in those movies red shadow is just silly the characters that are portrayed in this movie know that this isn't a serious movie and show that all is about the fun look at the characters from parodies like hot shots or scary movie everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never fall out of character and because of this certain scenes become funny and hilarious in red shadow the actors never achieve that the shadow supposed to be very skilled and deadly sadly the actors don't do their best in convincing us of their talents they don't do things with a straight face the jokes would have worked better if they did the bad choreography of the action scenes also damaged the viewing experience for me i like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good red shadow just fails in that department so what is left to be enjoyed well the music techno was uplifting it had to be as the action it self never is exciting and there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple the use of humor lack of story and depth make me think that this movie is meant for children but i do wonder if children actually would like this movie waste of time
<START> trite and tiring the one liners almost made me cry my 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle i don't know what age group this was written for but the writer himself herself didn't even want credit as for the song it's mildly amusing at least it was a decade ago there are many christmas movies to watch although i've seen some many more times than this they are still enjoyable whenever this comes on i try to encourage my child to watch something else one positive note that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1 is that it encourages good moral values that would have been encouraging if anyone were watching
<START> this is truly abysmal i just got a copy of disco beaver from outer space after hearing good things about it and i have to say this was just so incredibly unfunny and bad it will leave you numb and mystified how this ever got made br br i mean what was it is it that this is typical late 70's humor i don't think so this is just so bad and believe me i don't mean so bad it's good either this is a collection of extremely unfunny skits as if you are watching cable tv sure enough this was an hbo program and to think this may have been considered groundbreaking is scary br br there is one somewhat pretty girl in it and there is some old nhl footage of the ny islanders hockey team which is fun to see even though i am a lifelong ny rangers fan but they even mess that up as they try to get some humor out of two hockey players scuffling on the ice as if they are dancing and even worse reverse the videotape of two hockey players fighting to make it look like they are having sex oh how funny in one slight bit of cleverness there is an interview a hockey player named chico who resembles ny islander chico but they even blow this by having him wear a rangers jersey well maybe that was intentional who knows br br the bottom line is disco beaver is just so blatantly horrible so unbelievably bad you will definitely feel cheated after watching this and wasting almost an hour of your life you'll wonder what possibly made the makers of this garbage think they had something funny here and you'll also wonder why these skits can't even come close to the worst saturday night night slop incredible just incredible
<START> i kept watching it because it seemed like the plot was going somewhere when it ambiguously got there i was very disappointed i'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence but maybe i won't maybe i'll just imply something will happen the writers lacked any imagination this is not even a b movie it's a made for tv b movie
<START> itÂ´s a joke right lynch could not get produced this as a tv show he was out of money so what to do well he received somehow some dollars and completed the pilot and created this mess by just mixing everything together how can anybody see a failed pilot for tv as an cinematic masterpiece br br and now everybody is guessing about the deeper meaning well wake up there is none like in that other tv series by lynch what was the name again same procedure there build up a mystery and then come up with nothing i guess lynch will repeat this concept until people will realise the emperor has no clothes br br in germany there is a comedian called he dressed up as an opera singer and performed some new art songs singing complete nonsense like this br br the wolf the lamb on the meadow br br itÂ´s a classic now br br anyway afterwards he discussed it with the audience and they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf lamb relationship br br you people giving this movie a rating of 8 0 in imdb com you people could be one of them br br so letÂ´s say it all together br br 0 10 macaulay j connor
<START> one of the worst shows of all time the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the bad ass girl who are these actors never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show the stories were as unbelievable as the actors lame would be the best way to describe it somehow this show makes a slug like ice t more believable as a cop and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded
<START> yes i know that this movie is meant as a comedy and the humor is over the top but the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched i cannot say that it will happen but if we don't take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility i have noticed that some schools aren't teaching facts anymore like history geography basic stuff the focus is more on learning practical abilities the theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work in the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with in stead of water well we can laugh about it but if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know to me this is a scary notion so now you understand why this subject isn't funny anymore it could be that mike judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesn't improve fast am i taking this movie too seriously yes of course to each his own fun i loved mike judge's work beavis and butthead and office space in these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time in idiocracy i missed this most of the events are too absurd and as i said earlier very scary i do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie
<START> just watched on this early experimental short film directed by william vance and orson welles yes you read that right orson welles years before he gained fame for radio's the war of the worlds and his feature debut citizen kane welles was a 19 year old just finding his muse besides vance and welles another player here was one virginia nicholson who would become first wife she plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an african american servant paul edgerton in blackface during this time a man welles keeps passing her by courtesy of the scene constantly repeating i won't reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jump cut constantly that's not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score by larry added in the 2005 print i watched worth a look for welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avant garde
<START> hey guys and girls don't ever rent or may god forbid buy this piece of garbage i have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one the acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1 grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings in fact we would have been taken up to evaluation for the oscars if we were to be compared to the actors in darkhunters the story is terrible the makeup is terrible the filming is terrible the set is terrible the directing is terrible etc i can't actually find anything worth the money spent to see this film maybe except all the cats which my girlfriend thought were kind of cute please use your money on other things than on this film i couldn't even see the last 15 20 minutes of the film it was that terrible if anyone really liked this film i would really like to hear from you and i will try to see if i can get you some counseling at a psychiatrist's office near you br br 0 out of 10 actually below if possible not worth the dvd or tape it is on
<START> fans of the pink panther naked gun or get smart will certainly enjoy this farce that won one cÃ©sar and was nominated for four more br br jean is agent oss 117 a man who wouldn't know a clue if it hit him upside the head he is also a reflection of the colonialist attitude indicative of the west br br all of the russian spies nazis and muslim radicals around him are just as stupid but there is and the princess to keep things interesting br br oss uncanny ability to pick up languages play musical instruments the first time he picks them up and sing like a native are all more impressive than bond's tricks but he is still stupid
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br former new orleans homicide cop jack jean claude van damme is re assigned to columbus a small but violent town in mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town the culprits turn out to be ex military lead by former commander benjamin meyers stephen lord otherwise known as from east enders who is using a special method he learned in afghanistan to fight off his opponents but jack has a more personal reason for taking him down that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive br br after until death van damme appeared to be on a high showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market while that was a far more drama oriented film with the shepherd he has returned to the high kicking no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since derailed it's nowhere near as bad as that film but what i said still stands br br a dull predictable film with very little in the way of any exciting action what little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo mo sped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate being a mexican set film director isaac florentine has tried to give the film a robert rodriguez desperado sort of feel but this only adds to the desperation br br vd gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he's never been a robert de niro sort of actor that can't be good as the villain lord shouldn't expect to leave the beeb anytime soon he gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an american accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end all the supporting cast are equally bland and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all br br this is one shepherd that's strayed right from the flock
<START> i agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism it is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness i want to comment on the matt dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie here we have a man who contrasted with the film's underlying message that we're all a little racist effectively rapes a woman in public cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that as he well knows will lead to his arrest or even death he does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because as we come to understand they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases this behavior is not a little racist this behavior is evil it is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence to illustrate that everybody's a little racist later we're spoon fed some tripe about dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house is this supposed to explain or worse excuse this behavior and is dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before please the fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it
<START> racing enthusiast fabian as tommy callahan smokes drinks and suffers blackouts while juggling feelings for alluring brunette annette funicello as francie madsen and blonde mainstay diane mcbain as annie blaine complicating matters are ms boozy race car boyfriend warren as eddie sands and her father jan murray as pete madsen who encourages the reckless drivers cow eyed performance is sometimes enjoyable however her drunken driving scene is unnerving thunder alley provides marginally more nascar excitement than its predecessor fireball 500 1966 be warned it isn't much a wild party scene featuring some mild strip tease is the film's low highlight
<START> hell to pay is a bit bloody for my taste even though it is no worse than many films nevertheless i did enjoy the parade of seasoned stars and the western scenery all but the story line was very weak and i couldn't really see the point of it all however the music that accompanies the movie more than makes up for the lackluster film br br where did the guys nate noah who wrote this music come from they are awesome from the moment the music begins it is by far better than anything i've heard in years i think it may be the best i've ever heard even though i wasn't thrilled with the action taking place on the film the music evoked the exact emotion that was needed for each scene i was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and really felt like i was re living those old days through the music br br this movie is definitely worth a purchase and a viewing for the beautiful music and a trip down memory lane to see the old western stars once again
<START> eugene o'neill's 4 and a half hour 1927 play brought to the screen in less than two hours the play's combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama hasn't aged very well and the cast has some difficulty with it especially norma shearer's nina and ralph morgan's marsden clark gable as ned darrell comes off better but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the philosophical musings of the others which better fits gable's range once the plot settles down to the love and the audience adjusts to the voiceover asides the film does become more enjoyable the technique used here for the asides is another problem on stage the action froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience here they're done as voiceovers you'd think that would work better but since the action no longer freezes the actors are forced to pause speaking and grimace at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts plus it's difficult for any movie buff to watch this film and not think of groucho marx's hilarious parody version in animal crackers added to these drawbacks are some cuts made for censorship reasons nina's promiscuity is soft peddled and there is no mention of her getting the abortion that is more central in the play and a wretched score uncredited that sounds like background music to a turn of the century weepie o'neill called this film a dreadful hash of attempted and idiotic censorship and although strange interlude is nowhere near as great as his later the iceman and long day's journey into night it certainly deserved better than this
