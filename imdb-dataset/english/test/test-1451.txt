<START> you may like tim burton's fantasies but not in a commercial like show off lasting 8 minutes it demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace
<START> the stepford children besides being a very good made for tv movie shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination it is quite a statement about how being made to act within the confines of what is considered good behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual i think that this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some semblance of the thought that within the hearts and minds of youngsters should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying i don't know if that was in any way the intent of this movie but i have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best movie devices against the wish to have children conform to an unrealistic and domineering pretense of what is in the best interest of anyone other than that of the children themselves i hope to one day see this movie on dvd i am at the starting gate waiting
<START> what can i say about the pleasure planet that i haven t said about umpteen other tedious soft core porn films very little it s just another movie with a very weak plot used to set up very unconvincing set scenes between male non actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos who have obviously had silicon implants actually the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of film as the cast members grind their hips together giving pained expressions like they ve got constipation or something no wonder a lot of people claim sex is over rated they ve probably watched too many of these films on late night cable stations
<START> well made documentary about a sailing race sanity and the loss of both br br i remembered reading sir francis account of his trip around the world when i was in high school as i watched this film what an adventure that was br br deep water tells an equally fascinating story br br it takes a special person and an excellent sailor to manage a non stop trip around the world alone br br this film does a great job of demonstrating that br br i love to sail and my brother races j 30s br br but i could never accomplish such a feat
<START> i think vampire movies usually are wicked even if the film itself isn't all that good i still like it 'cos its got vampires in it but this stinks it really does give vampire movies a bad name br br for a start the cheapness really shows i'm not usually that bothered about low budget films one of my favourite all time movies is el mariachi which only cost but i hate this the actions a load of crap as well resorting to a wobbling camera which gives you headache br br theres not much more to say other than don't watch this i bought it for Â£1 50 as it was an ex rental and i feel cheated out of my money even for that low price
<START> what we know of caravaggio suggests a strutting with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas his themes were sex death redemption above all finding the sacred within the profane he lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim strangling the boy for the purity of his scream br br you can't fault derek jarman for his cinematography nor his recreations of paintings and you certainly can't accuse the man of shying away from the homosexuality but frankly jarman never strays beyond 80s caricature italian patronage becomes the 80s london art scene complete with pretty waiters and sean bean is a sexy bit of northern rough his motorbike tilda swinton performs a transformation worthy of a mills and boons why miss lena without that gypsy you're beautiful jarman provides caravaggio with a particularly trite motive for the murder which left him exiled br br this could have been a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous exciting violent and decadent but who nonetheless elevated the lives of ordinary people to the status of renaissance masterpieces looked on by and kings instead what you get is pierre et gilles do italy the pretty bodies of young boys are shown to perfection but never the men who inhabit them jarman appears to satirise the london art scene showing it shallow and pretentious to use caravaggio and renaissance italy to make the point is to use a silk purse to make a pig's ear in fairness this film remains visually stunning but ultimately as two dimensional as the paintings it describes
<START> how did so many talented or at least charismatic actors wind up in this baloney nothing is very good about this movie but the worst things probably are the screenplay and the directing br br apparently this is director damian heart piece as he's both written and directed it and acted in as well he's a card magician himself and seems to have named characters in homage of other famous magicians this was his first feature film as far as i know and chances are it's his last br br it's hard to point to exactly what makes it so poor Â but i'd say the story and character's are not believable the screenplay and the directing doesn't give it any boost the director plus Â the poker scenes are bad in the worst hollywood manner super hands hollywood rules the supposed twists in the movie are either totally predictable or totally unbelievable they just end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as a few decent scenes
<START> having just come home from my third viewing of the curse of the were rabbit i decided to jump on imdb and see what others thought i noticed a lot of brits loved it while those in america just didn't get it that really doesn't come as any shock as america doesn't get what english is br br wallace and gromit are very english middle class english in fact with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure the film is a lot like our two heroes simple and unassuming it has a nice and gentle plot so the children don't get lost yet there's enough beef there to keep the adults amused too there's some light innuendo which seems have to have offended the evangelic oh noes drama but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment when people get offended by a plasticine anus you know the world's messed up br br one quick note to those all american so far that i have seen who think chicken run is a better film chicken run was made to pander to your sense of humour and i think it suffered because of it curse of the were rabbit is witty english and intelligent thomas the tank film was ruined because it was made to please the americans and i'm glad nick park did not let that happen to another great british institution br br to sum up you can keep your chicken runs your your that kind of crude crass slapstick comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is wallace and gromit in curse of the were rabbit english to the core and long may wallace and gromit stay that way
<START> even those of us who like cute animal pictures and i abhor them would be hard pressed to find any merit in this abysmally bad travesty of a film perhaps inspired by 101 dalmatians with its smart and loyal dogs its dumb and devious humans and its absurdly happy and predictable ending the alternate title 101 turkeys springs to mind that would just about cover everyone involved in its unfortunate production i dismissed it as some inane hollywood perversion of british customs before learning to my horror that it actually is a canadian film done in victoria bc that phony british theme park of a town while sucking tax dollars out of ottawa on that equally phony pit of canadian mediocrity let me count the ways it is bad the dizzy plot the asinine script the dismal performances and sophomoric direction the cloyingly clever animals the endless clichÃ©s and predictable slapstick on second thought neither i nor those browsing the imdb have time for a complete catalogue of its failings yet were i to detail its merits this space would remain blank trust me it is bad a signal monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible canadian cinema if you have seen it already my condolences if you have not stay away from it as you would sars or bubonic plague or other movies with cute animals don't even let your children see it lest their tiny minds be warped by the even tinier minds of those who financed fabricated and filmed this frightful folly perhaps tonight when i retire i will have a nightmare with ghastly fanged beasts springing from the bed table as i flee in frantic flight i hope so it will be a far far better thing i do than watch this beastly banal but then i might dream that i had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of that makes me want to stay up all night trembling at the very possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dream i might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead maybe godzilla or attack of the killer tomatoes perhaps the instruction video for my built in vacuum cleaner
<START> if you re not old enough to remember globus and menahem golan here s the rundown they re a couple of film producers and from israel who set up the cannon film company in the early 1980s the only israeli to get a worse press than these two was begin begin probably deserved the bad press but globus and golan were a god send to film makers because no matter how bad your script was they d happily fund your movie and would normally employ directors who couldn t direct and actors who couldn t act in fact you often got the impression that people would just walk up to and menahem ask them for some money and they d oblige without seeing the film maker s resume if only producers nowadays were so trusting br br the young warriors isn t a cannon film but globus and golan did finance it and it has their signature all over it it s badly directed badly acted badly edited but it s the script that jumps out and attacks you with its awfulness it starts with a bunch of high school jocks getting involved in all sorts of zany pranks in fact the first 20 minutes of the movie plays out like a sex comedy and it s something of a shock when the young warriors turns into a vigilante movie but it s not just any type of vigilante movie like exterminator 2 or death wish 3 notice a connection they re both sequels and they re both vigilante movies made by cannon films no this is a laughably bad vigilante movie about pretty boy high school jocks and their poodle going on a mission to wipe out scumbags this film is proof that globus and golan were giving money to people regardless of their film making abilities and you have to worry about people who seem to spend their entire reserves on making movies set entirely around vigilantes
<START> uggh hanna barbera of the 60s and 70s what lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these hacks it's a shame really as in the 1940s and 1950s hanna barbera meant quality because they produced so many wonderful tom and jerry cartoons however with the major cost cutting efforts of the late 1950s cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were slashed in fact william hanna and joseph barbera were fired by mgm and replaced by a team of czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons so in the late 50s the team was out of work and decided if you can't beat 'em join 'em and began producing horrid little cartoons themselves with horrible animation backgrounds and writing br br it's unfortunate but the team's production of crappy cartoons worked too well making them rich and the most successful producers of cartoons of the 60s and 70s during this time again and again bad production values was their norm and a long list of very forgettable cartoons were created in this case the amazingly bad inch high private eye a completely unfunny and stupid idea if you want to know what the show was about the title says it all br br rotten to the core and strong evidence that the production team had total contempt for us kids
<START> i just watched this movie last night within 30 minutes of the start i was hoping it would end br br it had a promising beginning the first 10 minutes the premise of this movie friendship that goes nowhere after they've spent days and years together in separate beds in hotel rooms is just not believable he does kiss her somewhere along the way and she feels ohh so terrible about it br br very little substance to grab your interest the acting just does not hold up he is very passive regardless of how much of the movie is shown the viewer never develops any type of a caring connection with the characters on the screen you learn that her next utterance will be as boring as her previous one do you have a cigarette he doesn't smoke he wants her to stop smoking doesn't she know this by now br br she calls him in the middle of the night to visit him after a year's absence she comes in through the door they don't even hug or kiss or express any type of emotional connection he doesn't even lean forward to lift her suitcase to help her in that is not how real people behave this is not how best pals behave br br when he receives her phone call in the middle of the night she is in town for one day he shows little interest to see her face acts more like she will be a burden for the night at this point they've known each other for two years and he hasn't seen her for a year not believable not real br br supposedly he has written a book on entropy and yet we never see him write or read or discuss any of his interests in physics with her not that she would be able to handle the discussion we learn that a watermelon in l a costs 50 it wasn't the silicon type mind you he has no problem that fruit we also learn that the airport shuts down when a few really really fake snow flakes fall off the sky i'm sorry but was that in l a too br br we never see how these two characters survive we never see them at work we never see them struggle they are always on vacation they have infinite time they have no worries whatsoever br br nice life unreal life unreal characters bad title bad movie
<START> well sadly i can't help but feeling a little bit disappointed after my much much much anticipated viewing of just before dawn jeff is a terrific filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things with a tiny budget but i nevertheless expected to see a far more sadistic and gruesome early 80's slasher but actually i'm beginning to think that isn't the one to blame for this but we gorehounds are it's more than obvious that intended to make his take on the backwoods slasher look like deliverance and absolutely not like friday the 13th which immensely popularized the sub genre one year earlier the horror and constant sensation of menace doesn't mainly come from the demented maniacs with their machetes but from the genuinely ominous and isolated oregon forests where this movie was shot in case the film seems slow and uneventful this is only because takes his time to introduce the dark woods and eerie mountains as extra characters in his film we hardly ever see the killers in person but there always appears to be someone luring from behind the trees or from underneath the mountain lakes bearing this in mind just before dawn becomes a highly admirable horror effort and actually a lot better than its contemporary blood soaked colleagues amidst a nearly endless selection of gory and sickening slashers successfully puts the emphasis back on tension and character development the plot revolves on five twenty something friends heading for a camping vacation in the oregon woods where one of them owns a small piece of land the woods are deserted and naturally the campers ignore forest ranger roy's george kennedy advise to return back to civilization shortly after they brutally encounter an inbred family of which the twin sons have murderous tendencies all five main characters are surprisingly likable and convincing no irritating stereotypes for which you don't feel sympathy anyway like slutty girls or football jocks as a result of this natural character you automatically cheer for them even when they eventually almost turn into savages themselves the sublime camera work supplies the film with an at times unbearable tension level and brad chilling electronic score only adds to this effect just before dawn is a fine slice of early 80's horror as long as you don't desire blood to drip from your tv set
<START> very disturbing but expertly crafted scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for color and detail mary beth hurt sandy dennis and especially randy quaid are unusually good the story centers around a young boy bryan wondering where all the leftovers they eat every night comes from his parents hurt quaid strange behavior causes the school psychiatrist dennis to get involved it is a gruesome cannibal movie but it's not bad if you like hannibal you'll love this if you don't like parents stay away from the film just giving advice to cannibal lover and haters br br rated r for strong adult themes and graphic violence
<START> eisenstein wasn't just one of the greatest soviet russian but one of the great masters of the cinema among griffith murnau ford hitchcock welles and others one of the greatest things in all his films was the edition very personal and in this movie is exceptional this was his first sound movie and the use of the musical score by great russian composer serge in the sequence of the battle is a perfect contrast between music and image watching this film is like taking a class or lesson in cinema something that no many film directors can afford i never get tired of watch real classics like this film i hope that in near future more people will recognize a great work of art
