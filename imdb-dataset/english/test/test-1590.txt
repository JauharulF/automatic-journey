<START> liv in her sexiest movie br br she incorporates the femme fatale role in an astonishing way while in the same time she manages to appear a super sexy woman while keeping the sweet girl stand and not being over wicked like other similar movies e g femme fatale with rebecca br br until this movie lord of the rings was the only movie i ever saw her im hooked on with lotr br br point by lotr i had shaped an opinion that the role of the pure sweet woman was the only role that liv could interpret but when i saw one night at mc cool i absolutely changed my mind she is the sexiest woman ever br br therefore as a film is a mediocre common comedy with a confusing plot
<START> i finally rented this video after searching for it for many months initially i only wanted to see it because i'm an out and out neil pearson fan patrick boyfriend of isobel the lead however the movie stands up very well without neil although he handles himself very well in this movie he is overshadowed by the three main female characters it's an eerie intense movie the sort the brits do so well definitely a chick flick the house and it's isolated setting giving the movie an almost wuthering heights aura the movie is full of tension and the ending shocking yet somehow inevitable i'm glad i watched it it was worth the wait
<START> let's see cardboard characters like muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped you'll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world the world of religious fantasy complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of papier mache everybody gets dragged off to hell except for one poor chap who goes to heaven where he can presumably spend eternity with the blockheads that created this masterpiece of the absurd i think i'd opt for hellfire myself go see something else unless you are stoned in which case you might actually like it couldn't hurt
<START> the 1935 version of enchanted april manages to be simultaneously tedious br br and perfunctory it is difficult to show the transformative magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to belabor the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later rather than develop the screenplay flips a switch and the br br characters are different br br the husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and or hostilities br br jessie ralph has the most fun moving instead of entirely chewing up the br br scenery and katharine alexander has some poignant charm out of her br br husband's shadow and away from his hideous droning ann harding is br br unremarkable here with the production code being enforced she had an br br appropriate line in an earlier pre code movie when ladies meet you're br br not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you but in enchanted april can only look hurt rush out and proclaim to her errant husband
<START> just after watching the first one and it is very dumb i happened to watch an episode of bones first and then the eleventh hour the 11th hour should be embarrassed br br it is so weak stewart introduces himself as a government scientist no mention of what kind of scientist just general stuff in a program about cloning they bring a caretaker who was paid to dispose unsuccessful embryos to a church and made him kneel before the statue of jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness and as well tell them where the bad guy is so as they can move the plot on now thats science at work br br there is a dumb not good dumb bit where picard rages at a tv that advertises skin scream that makes you look younger shouting it's a lie as his randy female assistant gets groped by the local hot bobbie next door br br the end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady named after daddy in order to move the clunky plot along waves at picard from the street as she gets in a taxi picard is one floor up and he looks out a window wistfully going she got away he could like try to run down or maybe ring the cops or maybe get the number of the taxi and ring it in or maybe had anything other than i am waving and getting into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do about it until next week ending br br pity it's so stupid at one point a grieving father is convinced by picard that even if a replica clone son was born it would never be his son as his son had a soul yes that's right folks the general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that every soul is unique and sure why else would you want to clone br br although the general scientist picard finds cloning a bit gooey he's all up for stem cell research and goes as far as to say that calamity will befall humanity if it isn't allowed he has a pretty strident rant about how important it is of course he doesn't mention a single example that kind of sums up the show buzz words and
<START> this cartoon is not right lol i totally disagree with a lot of things it portrayed however it ended on a positive note but as for me and mine we will not be viewing this in our household mainly because we fight against stereotypes every day and this cartoon just confirms what most white people feel black people act like br br the comment one of the little black girls made on the cartoon was that her boyfriend was so conscious he was white that really offended me that's not something we as black people take lightly conscious is a state of being that black people achieve when they realize their true ability
<START> james cagney the yankee doodle dandy boy was just starting his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also a social worker for a boys reform school which is being run by corrupt the reform school inmates are minors from the streets of new york like the east side kids who were poor and for during the great depression in the final scenes there is a trial held by the reform school boys with flaming torches and a barn which is set on fire and a big leap by the corrupt warden i noticed that they did let the horses out of the barn first this film is not shown very often and i really can understand why
<START> i have to admit i am prejudiced about my vote on this film but i have strong reasons as i know some of the true history that was given the hollywood treatment here edna ferber's novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names can't be used in a way this film is all smoke mirrors even though it was released in 1946 it was filmed shortly after casablanca ingrid bergman is at her most radiant in this movie as a brunette br br she plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband today that is a gold digger but in this social era she is desirable the kind of woman who makes all the men want her all the old snooty society types talk of her avoid her while wishing they were her ingrid is at her best plays this role well br br some sympathy for character is raised in the new orleans section of this film as she manages to get a decent belated tomb for her mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to get her to leave new orleans the snooty family of relatives there are so by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town br br gary cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing texan bachelor gambler he pulls it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking flora as ingrid's maid got nominated for an oscar as supporting actress in this film jerry austin as was over looked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film does it well br br when the film moves to saratoga it depicts accurately how important saratoga was in that era i like the sequence when bergman walks to the spring to get some of the sulfur water which everyone considered so healthy then when she drinks some she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good it is that she must have more br br the real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in tunnel new york which is the actual saratoga trunk the film title is derived from this battle actually happened in between agents for andrew j p morgan the line was the economic key to the country in connecting coal country the east coast the references to it are throughout the film are very real there is even some dialog describing as a scot though the reference is vague unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle br br the railroad line the railroad tunnel in tunnel new york zip code still exist although the film was shot in california the real tunnel is about 1 mile long it is still part of a key freight line today years after this occurred i grew up there gary cooper's line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right it is still mighty pretty country
<START> this is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their erasmus year in barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in europe and is an ideal location br br the idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere there are some clichÃ©s about the countries but most of them are true the characters could not better represent their different countries br br having experienced erasmus on myself during my semester in italy i can say that is movie is incredibly authentic i had many experiences which were similar to the characters except i didn't get laid as often the movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid american college movies br br finally the movie touches also some important issues like the change from student to work life br br 9 10 i may not be very objective though
<START> manna from heaven' is a delightfully compelling film br br within the shifting paradox of values in middle class americans from 40 years ago to the present day the plot tweaks the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of damon characters br br their struggles with moral dilemmas on what might have been ' hopes to yet fulfill youthful dreams romantic yearnings and hit it big' combine to make a most entertaining film rather than relying upon in your face' sexual explicitness the burgeoning relationship between inez and mac bake is classically subtle but clear his the knot in her at the art gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstanding br br the script's crisp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast one of the few films i have ever to see twice in its opening run manna from heaven' definitely warrants national distribution br br conrad f
<START> i was a little afraid when i went to the cinema to see this movie indeed it is always tough to make a movie from a comics and the first episode of the adventures of the french two greatest heroes was good but not fantastic finally it is very funny from the beginning to the end with unexpected gags some cartoon scenes no great fx a great cast great landscapes great everything br br however i wonder how they will manage to translate all the french names in english or german because it is certainly funny in french but how will it be in another language
<START> this odd little film starts out with the story of bruno alex linz in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday he likes to wear dresses and his obese mother angela who is a doesn't think their is anything wrong with what her son likes angela complains to mother superior kathy bates but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to they're car they are harassed by the other kids and are pelted with eggs bruno's father dino gary sinise is divorced from angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically disowns him bruno meets a new student at school named who is a free spirit and dresses like annie oakley with cap pistols angela has a heart attack and bruno's grandmother steps in to take care of him when dino refuses br br the film starts out with a very hard and unsympathetic look at all the characters involved angela has a great deal to do with bruno wearing dresses as she practically encourages him dino was told when he was a young boy by his mother that he was a sissy because he liked opera and now he refuses to help bruno when he needs it the catholic school that bruno attends is very unruly and all the kids run rampant and even call the n word once shirley maclaine steps in the film shifts and becomes more family oriented so to speak spoiler alert the ending after the spelling bee is incredibly contrived and feel good hugs and cheers for bruno as reporters follow him and take his picture for their papers all the while shirley maclaine is acting like the tough old broad who snaps at everyone there is one thing about maclaine's character in the film that no one has mention in these comments and it has to do with the masculine nature of her i think the character of helen might be a lesbian she's very tough and strong and at one point in the film she shares a shot of whiskey with bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time i don't remember anyone in the film mentioning who her husband was or if she was ever married at all this is why i think her character might be gay lots of other good actors appear in the film as well joey lauren adams jennifer tilly brett butler gwen verdon and lainie kazan all should have taken a better look at the script before they signed on i guess when they heard that maclaine was directing that it would be an honor to be part of it very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding towards any of the characters and the subject matter is probably impossible for most to relate to the actors are not bad but what exactly was maclaine aiming for tolerance towards a young boy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression we get that in the first 10 minutes the rest of the time i was trying not to cringe
<START> this movie is awful beyond belief it's a low budget badly written piece of pointless garbage but the saturday afternoon i stumbled across it on tv still sticks in my mind as one of the most entertaining i've ever spent in front of the television the badness of this movie is epic maybe not ed wood epic but close the premise is hysterical men are banned for being too dangerous and imprisoned in haw football stadiums the pseudo dyke culture is laughably bizarre there's an underground sex trade with women who dress up like men to service deviants and the last man of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of rocky from rocky horror picture show i didn't get to see the end of it which i have to assume was so dripping with syrupy what have we all learned from this nonsense it would bring on an urge to brush the teeth but everything in the first two thirds was so memorably bad even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest it's still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy stupid brainless sci fi b flicks
<START> i loved this show but then i don't remember ever not loving anything he did starting with americanization of emily a town sheriff who keeps trying to steal the town blind and ride off to mexico gotta love it like everything he does it has a tongue in cheek flavor that brands it as a garner product james plays the same character in lots of his shows and movies but somehow it never gets stale br br p s re killing off the main character br br if i remember right the good brother was killed off and replaced with the evil twin in an effort to increase the ratings i e make it more like every other western on tv at the time i think this show was too far ahead of its time and i still miss it tv without a jimmy g show is missing something
<START> spike milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years and 2002's is sadly no exception the novel set in 1924 concerns the of ireland in particular its effects on a solitary community the of the title due to a colossal blunder half the village is now in northern ireland the other half is in the republic locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path drinkers crowd like into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint a dead man has to have a passport made out in his name before villagers can reach the to bury him br br is a sort of irish 'under milk wood' with comic characters and surreal happenings galore the lead character dan milligan renamed in the film is played by sean hughes and has conversations with the narrator richard attenborough also in the film is milo o'shea rhys jones david kelly from 'robin's nest' freddie jones joe mcgann and elliott gould br br interviewed for the 'making of documentary writer director terence ryan expressed undying admiration for the book it shows on screen but alas like the ill fated film of 'the hitch guide to the galaxy' a good book does not necessarily make a good film the trouble with is that like milligan's other books they simply do not work on the big screen is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot br br no way can the film be compared to train wrecks like 'sex lives of the potato men' 'fat and 'lesbian vampire killers' but then neither is it as good as it should have been the last half hour involves a lot of running around by the police the british army some locals who have stashed explosives in a coffin and is really tedious to sit through ryan's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film br br the other problem is the total absence of charm had this in spades while the 'father ted' television series was funnier by far spike lived long enough to see the film and apparently enjoyed it his daughter jane has a cameo as bride br br the highlight for me though was the quotation at the beginning i don't mind dying said spike i just don't want to be there when it happens
