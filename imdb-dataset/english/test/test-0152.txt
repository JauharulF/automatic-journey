<START> drew barrymore is such a great actress when it comes to these kind of movies she stars wonderfully and gets away with the quirks and jokes romantic comedies like this suit her and i believe that she's done her best so far check out her other romantic comedies you'll see what i mean
<START> if you are going to see this movie by all means don't go into this movie with the expectation of this movie will be absolutely hilarious because you will be let down yeah sure its funny at times but i would consider it a political thriller masqueraded as a comedy the performances are very good especially by jeff goldblum as the head of the election company even though he has limited screen time he makes a lasting impression of course robin williams is excellent laura linney is very good too what a surprise she is one of the finest actresses in hollywood and one scene in particular shows this this film makes you think what if a comedian ran for president and actually won would the country be better off or would the country shatter into a million pieces
<START> the good news is that the circus is in town the bad news is that's right over bugs bunny's underground home he wakes up as his place shakes like an earthquake hit it when workers pound stakes into the ground and elephants stomp by etc br br to be more specific the lions' cage is place exactly over hole the lion sniffs food and by process of elimination figures out it's a rabbit bugs curious what all the racket is about winds his way through the tunnel and winds up in the lion's mouth br br i'll say for thing for bb he is totally fearless at least in this cartoon and at least for 30 seconds when he comes to his senses he runs like crazy and we get a lion versus a rabbit battle the rest of the way once again bugs faces dumb opponent one he calls nero but lion is fierce and bugs will need all his wits and somewhat fake bravado to fend off this beast br br about half the gags are stupid and the other half funny but always fast moving colorful and good enough to recommend i mean it's not everyday you can see a lion on a trapeze or doing a hula dance
<START> i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14 br br i was really annoyed with my little cousin as she was very hyper that day so i saw a film on the disney channel and put it on and told her to watch it br br she is 6 and she loved the film some bits she didn't get like the ending but i didn't get that either y was eddie the star of the video shoot i thought it was jordan's video but she did enjoy it br br i noticed the mistakes such as at the end jordan was not actually playing the guitar but she never br br it is definitely a film for if you are seriously bored or 10 and under br br it calmed my cousin down well br br although all she did was sing for the rest of the day then
<START> the producers of this picture are hungarians it's not by crazy artistic momentum that x and z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word means 'god' in hungarian by the way david is the word for god in hungarian hum is that so br br let's consider this movie as 'a history of violence' science fictional sibling both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres thriller and drama in the 2005 one and fx ed as hell' science fiction in the one we're looking at right now everything he does have a meaning and is surrounded by details the nod to phil k dick who wrote in the days of perky pat by creating a fast food restaurant the nod to stanley kubrick by using 2001's naming pattern as ibm became hal one letter down in the alphabet in the 1968 movie in 'classic 40 becomes 60 one letter up when cleans up port the nod to david cronenberg by using witty kind of formula 'death to ' 'long live' and by taking another medium for central theme of a picture tv in videodrome video games and virtual reality in in 1983 you penetrated a tv set in 1999 you're penetrated by a game welcome to canada br br the nod to good taste by getting peter cinematography howard shore's music and ronald sanders's editing a team that wins for everyone born in the early 80's with a super a genesis or an arcade stick in the hands this movie rings a bell enough with the nods the plot jennifer jason leigh stars as a game designer who creates a virtual reality game that taps into the players' minds as we can see on the movie main details page that's the story in the story to me this picture is about a 'reality young couple infiltrating the 'brand new virtual game' presentation session to destroy its programmer i assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality if there's such thing as reality jennifer jason leigh is always playing a game designer in the game they're in and the end of the movie is the reality with video games freaks giggles big hairy dogs plastic textures helmets and stuff and 9mm handguns what you see is true they play during an hour or so in this game there's a game in which plays genius programmer and jude law a marketing trainee associated with game they play because is very concerned about her health the thing you plug your nervous system in in order to play she has to plug herself and in then wins the game and back in the reality they kill nourish programmer br br playing and is about facing your essence face your subconscious while its creating a virtual reality you'll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game by playing the game the girl playing the 'reality turns into a br br what game would have played to feel his abstract da term to be truly engaged in the world br br and what about yes friedrich god is dead and you know what willem dafoe stands for him god the br br yes we do construct a narrative for ourselves and losing this thread we follow from one day to the next disintegrate people as personalities discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who engaged it truly and we could sometimes get some neat stuff a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality
<START> one day someone said lets redo the mod squad we can make it hip cool and all that yo it'll make a mint then they actually made it and as you are watching it you can hear your spleen cringe in agony as it twists and binds into a knot from the pure horror of it all any movie ever made has something on this id rather meet wayne newton and sing karaoke with him in a gay bar in idaho and drink a virgin bloody mary than ever watch this again may god have mercy on my soul
<START> i thought this movie was really awesome one of drew's best i am also a fan of michael vartan so i thought he was so hot in this movie why all the bad reviews i would want to watch this movie over and over again if i could i also loved the ending this movie clearly has shown a smile on my face i was also surprised that james franco and jessica alba were in it i love them both so i also highlighted this movie at the end when drew is making the huge comment about the truth it really told the truth of what sometimes happens in high school again the movie was amazing defiantly a 10 10 hope this comment was very useful to any imdb readers
<START> this film spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana however the plot and visuals are so insane that it seems more like the poster child for lsd br br plot the heroic struggle of michael as he battles his drug addiction while being subjected to the humiliation brought on by the likes of winnie the pooh and papa smurf br br yea yea there's a good message but it's obscured by the fact that the writers have taken a rather stale psa idea and tried stretching it into 30 minutes this includes a song sequence where you're told that there's a million rational ways to say no such as i can't smoke pot i have homework br br the writers can't make up their minds what to do with the characters they've brought in royalty free at first we see they all have to hide from the human characters but within five minutes we see them all running around in plain sight without anyone noticing soon they begin interacting with the human cast and the only one who's even slightly disturbed by this fact is not the drug abusers it's the little sister who talks to her teddy bear pooh by the way further there's the little drug demon floating around because you know pushers don't give kids drugs he too is ambiguous while he might be symbolic of michael's addiction and hence is not supposed to be seen by other people he goes and haunts little corey to get her into drugs so i guess he's uhhh moving on br br the whole plot finally culminates in some insane sequence in which michael is in what would appear to be the saturday morning carnival of souls aka a theme park from hell where the various cartoon characters beat him up and ignore him and stuff for example miss piggy eats him in a sandwich and spits him out if the writers were not high when writing this i must recommend they try getting high because they can't get crazier than this of course the film ignores the fact that michael's been having highs for two years by this point so why this tripping sequence would frighten him is beyond me br br i realize i'm completely whaling on this film but i actually just saw it again because i went through the trouble of tracking it down on ebay because of it's sheer infamy of being a bad cartoon the level of unintentional humor is is brilliant take this scene for example michael's dad is rooting through the fridge for a beer he notices many of them missing and mentions it to his wife the ever observant mom tells him don't worry you probably just drank them last night watching football while we're obviously supposed to be learning that michael is drinking beer in addition to the pot and crack we instead read further in and realize hey kids it's okay to have chemical as long as you're a grown up scenes like this are worth the tiny price tag of this film oh yea and the fact you get to hear simon the chipmunk say marijuana
<START> shadows breathes the smell of new york's streets like no film before it this kick off of cassavetes' directorial work is as atmospheric as political and the initial spark for a renewal in american cinema br br maybe it solicits for watching cassavetes' first work in a double feature with another debut godard's Ã bout de soufflÃ© both films shaped the cinematic production of their countries beyond decades and both breathe a peculiar lightness and which was later rarely achieved by those filmmakers in their career br br shadows tells from three afro american siblings ben ben carruthers lelia lelia goldoni and hugh hugh hurd the story is set in the new york jazz milieu and the driving rhythms on the soundtrack play a main part for the feverish sometimes almost dreamlike atmosphere which draws through the entire film there's not much happening in the plot the everyday life of the three siblings is defined by problems in love relationship or in their jobs but on both levels normality deceives without moralizing cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion in public and in private life it was regarding to the cinematic depiction of racism a breakthrough film in the us br br this film owes also a lot to the performances of the three leading actors which were all almost completely unknown before especially ben carruthers established with his energetic portrayal the image of a new self conception of young urban blacks in america an image which characterizes spike lee's films of the 80s and 90s revealingly none of those three doubtlessly extremely talented actors was able to start a big career afterwards hollywood wasn't and isn't ready to ethnically expand its star system and that is why goldoni hurd and carruthers only found small artistic in tv and independent films later on br br perhaps shadows is one of the less beautiful films ever shot and one of the most beautiful ones at the same time a film of shades and spaces with a camera that merely watches the stream of life in the crowded street corners bars hotel lobbies apartments inducing an intriguing ramble through new york's vibrant streets
<START> our story two u s navy deep sea divers search for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the filipino coast our proof extremely dull entertainment at its best with no plot in sight jim brown is completely wasted provided his help in producing this 70s war turkey richard jaeckel is in his usual form don cornelius and richard pryor are among those who gave special thanks in their contributions bombs away
<START> few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as fire has the movie is pretentious garbage it does not achieve anything at an artistic level the only thing it managed to receive is a ban in india if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy the ban would have been more justifiable br br now that i've got my distress out of my system i am more able to analyse the movie br br from the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in english the director of course did not make the movie for an indian audience however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect english is too unreal to be true br br next we get regular glimpses into radha's dreams these scenes are not very effective they coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie i'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story i felt that the surrealism was lost br br the love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement in any case they do not achieve either of the two br br the names chosen for the women radha and sita are names of hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences however since the film wasn't meant for indian audiences in the first place the shock through name selection is not meant to achieve its goal which is absurd br br the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject br br the acting felt wooden although nandita das brought some life into the role the others were wasted i always thought that shabana azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film the male leads were outright rubbish br br in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one please
<START> this movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies i have ever seen danny de vito plays owen perfectly momma is excellently portrayed and was one of the highlights of the movie br br at the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect larry is trying to write a book and is having some troubles larry teaches a writing class and owen tagged after larry trying to get him to read his story owen eventually asks larry to kill his mother and in return owen would kill larry's ex wife the whole movie was really hilarious br br one of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when owen writes throw momma from the train larry gets furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot it turns out that owen wrote a children's pop up book br br i would really recommend this movie i gave it a 10
<START> i saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and late night 80's sitcoms on tv one night at 2 in the morning i must say i didn't expect much and i didn't get much although rose is hot her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not oscar worthy to say the least this movie has its ups and downs and does have a nice couple of twists at the end but in all honesty it was awful not even a typical slasher movie no gore no sex no nudity no real violence just bad acting i'd give it a 3 out of 10
<START> this was an excellent movie fast paced well written and had an intriguing plot the special effects were innovative especially in the opening scene the training segment got a bit silly but overall it was a tense movie
<START> excellent documentary that still manages to shock and enlighten unfortunately times haven't changed much since this was made and it is thus an important piece for all freedom conscious americans to see
