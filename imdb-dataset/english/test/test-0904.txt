<START> like several other reviewers here i'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film dan o'bannon's previous effort was the groundbreaking 'alien' of 1979 because it and 'star wars' introduced the stylistic approach of or 'dirty space' in art direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce them br br rather than dismiss out of hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the traditions of british horror and science fiction specifically hammer and american international features like quatermass specifically and the pit' 1967 doctor who and 'the day of the 1963 if not the works of gerry anderson 'space and 'thunderbirds' but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer o'bannon's genre scholarly appreciation for 'queen of blood' 1966 and 'it the terror from beyond space' 1958 the immediate sources for 'alien' 1979 br br granted this film has some 'legacy' elements but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers 1981's 'an american werewolf in london' and 'the company of 1984 other 80's films that share a back' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist all three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same but substantially sexed up their themes because they could and at the same time they recognized the tongue in cheek humorous aspects of their projects br br neil jordan's played to many of the psychoanalytic floating around at the during the '80's while 'american werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming of age' film it's called artistic license and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter day dramedy inherent in the 'scream' franchise 'i know what you did last and 'final but these teen targeted films seem to be part of a box office trend whereas the 80's films like belong a canon of british sci fi even if this one was written by an american br br in many ways this film holds up much better than latter day disaster and alien invasion flicks day' 'deep impact' in that the don't reside in gun battles and testosterone at the opposite end of the pole it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didn't examine and more closely before they remade br br the goal of this film was fun not or stupidity br br 7 10
<START> this is my first film i'll confess we chose it mainly because we knew this had the enticing prospect of antonio banderas in gay sex scenes br br unfortunately that is about all that this film has to recommend it i consider myself a fairly sophisticated viewer i like european films art films and i am generally able to recognize a quality film even if it is not to my particular taste br br but this film was a complete blank to me the plot was ridiculous the characters lifeless the box called it a hilarious comedy but i didn't laugh once loosly and awkwardly constructed with a lot of pointless dialogue i don't get this at all it seems like an amateurish effort can someone enlighten me
<START> i caught this one on cable and i was very surprised steady direction and some good performances accent a twisty and very engaging story this one will keep you up all night thinking about what was real and what wasn't check out jason scott lee in the lou diamond phillips role
<START> this movie shows me that americans have no knowledge about the situation in the sad balkan brother war please if you want to see umpire movies with this theme watch savior and you will see that nobody is bad and nobody is good in this land of tears and sorrows
<START> yes this movie is obviously trying to be a conan the barbarian and what amazes me is that this is a sequel the people demanded another one the first part of the flick is a flashback showing the original from what i saw it doesn't look worth checking out and apparently ator always kills a huge puppet in his movies well now ator lives at the ends of the earth with his mute sidekick thong a girl seeks his help as this evil dude has her father in his custody let me just say this bad guy is extremely patient as the old guy constantly insults the villian and just prattles on endlessly the bad guy waits to the very end of the movie and finally smacks the old guy around leaving you to wonder what took him so long to snap meanwhile ator and his sidekick and the gal go through one adventure after another they fight cavemen invisible soldiers don't ask rent a thugs and people who worship snakes ator also battles a giant snake puppet and hang glides again don't ask all the while you will be thinking that conan would kick butt
<START> the only reason i gave this episode of masters of horror a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actors are good and it wasn't shot on vhs the story the dialog and the plot are ridiculous br br talking driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war give me a break what next zombies who come back to go maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows br br i never supported the iraq war but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces and homecoming was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war br br with zombies being mass produced in today's market this is the spam of zombie related entertainment how homecoming made it onto masters of horror is beyond me
<START> people say that this film is a 'typical teen horror movie' well it's a horror movie with a teenage girl in it what do you expect it's a good film i counted 3 actual screams in the audience whilst the film was on and it was a very jumpy scary film i wasn't bored in the film at any point and i was even on the edge of my seat at one point the only thing that was slightly bad was that it was a tiny bit slow in getting into the actual storyline but this all led up to why she was where she was and why what happened happened the acting was good the scenery was good and the storyline was good too i hope to see a 'when a stranger calls 2' in a few months good film
<START> apparently bernard cribbins ad libbed nearly all of his lines if you can sit through the oh my daddy bit without then you really need to get in touch with your inner child trust me i'm a 41 year old bloke
<START> i know it's not original but what the hey what else can be said about it i feel unutterably silly just paying any attention at all to from hell it came the movie makes the important political and social issue of fallout from atmospheric atomic tests seem a matter for joking and dismissal not the concern and alarm being raised by scientists all over the world at the time
<START> when this was first aired on masterpiece theatre it had a profound effect on me it's beautifully filmed and acted i immediately read the book by mary webb and it remains one of my all time favorites janet mcteer is wonderful as and i fully expected her to become a regular on the british drama scene i guess she chose to focus on the british stage instead br br i was hoping that with the american success of janet mcteer years later with tumbleweeds this film would again become available to us alas it has not yet been released on dvd if anyone out there is listening please make this available again
<START> felix in hollywood is a great film the version i viewed was very well restored which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films it has some of hollywood's most famous stars making cameo animated appearances a must for any silent film or animation enthusiast
<START> 'the merchant of is one of shakespeare's better known plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre incredibly however this film would seem to be the first ever english language version made for the cinema rather than television there were a number of versions made in britain or america during the early days of the cinema but these were all silents br br the reason for this neglect of the play may be connected with sensitivities about the play's alleged anti semitism a subject which has been even more sensitive since the rise to power of the nazis in 1933 this may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray shylock as a straightforward villain than it would be today yet in my view the film is not anti semitic at all it should be remembered that during shakespeare's lifetime there was no settled jewish community in england the jews had been expelled by edward i in the late 13th century and were not permitted to return until the time of cromwell some forty years after shakespeare's death as far as we know shakespeare never travelled abroad so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any jews personally or experienced the effects of anti semitism at first hand the play is not simply about the jewish question but is among other things an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice it may in fact be a coded examination of the mutual antipathy between catholics and protestants in tudor england something of which shakespeare certainly would have had first hand experience and an appeal for greater tolerance between them br br then as now traditional anti semitic stereotypes had always depicted jews as avaricious but principal sin is not avarice if it were he would certainly have accepted offer to pay him six thousand twice the amount borrowed by antonio rather sin is anger and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellow jews are treated by the christians of venice not only are jews in general regarded as second class citizens but jewish such as shylock are particular targets for abuse even though the services they provide are necessary to the venetian economy the play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice not only do views of this sort corrupt the christians who hold them they can also corrupt the jews who suffer abuse vindictiveness is out of all proportion to the wrongs he has suffered by spitting on him and calling him a dog antonio behaves like a boorish bigot but and bigotry are not generally regarded as crimes deserving of the death penalty moreover shylock seeks to revenge himself on antonio not merely for the undoubted wrongs that antonio has done towards him but also for all the wrongs real and imaginary that he has suffered at the hands of the christian community such as his daughter's marriage to lorenzo br br it is to the credit of the film's director michael radford and of its star al pacino that they understand all these issues pacino's shylock has initially a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vindictive rage and finally after his humiliation in the trial scene by reasoning to pathos we see clearly that he has been the instrument of his own destruction but we can still sympathise with him in my view none of pacino's performances that i have seen have ever equalled those he gave in the first two 'godfather' films not of a woman' for which he won an oscar and certainly not 'godfather iii' but 'the merchant of venice is the one that comes closest to those benchmarks the other acting performance that stood out was lynn collins's luminous speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing out the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine i was less impressed with jeremy antonio who seemed too passive antonio is a complex character part loyal friend part melancholy contemplative part religious bigot and part enterprising capitalist although irons captured the first two of those aspects it was difficult to his antonio either spitting on someone of a different faith or his all on risky trading ventures br br interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the who although he admired pacino's performance disliked the period setting and argued that shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have for a modern audience citing a recent stage production which set the action in weimar germany i would disagree profoundly with this approach the theatre and the cinema are quite different media and while there have been some striking modernist approaches to shakespeare in the cinema trevor night' comes to mind a traditionalist approach is often the best one i preferred for example zeffirelli's 'romeo and juliet' to baz luhrmann's the idea that we can only appreciate shakespeare in a modern guise is sheer intellectual laziness we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the elizabethan society that produced him but rather prefer him dressed up as an ersatz twentieth century man br br traditional approach not only enables us to appreciate that bigotry and vindictiveness are age old universal problems but also makes for a visually striking film in the play the scenes set in venice itself are characterised by turbulent action those set in country house at belmont are happier and more peaceful in the film the venetian exterior scenes were shot on location against a backdrop of misty wintry grey skies similar to the look achieved in 'don't look now' the candlelit interiors with faces brightly lit against a dark background were reminiscent of the chiaroscuro effects of a caravaggio painting i suspect this was quite deliberate as caravaggio was a contemporary of shakespeare by contrast to dark or misty venice the belmont scenes shot in an enchanting villa on an island in a lake were characterised by sunshine or peaceful moonlight br br this is one of the best shakespeare adaptations of recent years an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play 8 10 br br a couple of errors we see a black swan on the water in front of house these birds are natives of australia and were not introduced to europe until well after the date when the film is set also the portrait of in the leaden casket is painted in the style of the florentine botticelli who was active about a century before that date lynn collins may be reminiscent of a botticelli beauty but it seems unlikely that a late 16th century venetian lady would have had herself painted in the manner of late 15th century florence
<START> how important is the director anyway in this film made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 60s where questions of social organization were prime conflicts asks that question by making a movie that turns the camera away from the action and only begs to reveal the director william greaves it is an important work as it shows like no other movie shows the difficulties in blocking organizing and setting the scene it reveals the role of the crew something most directors frankly would like to disappear completely and that the invisibility of is essential for suspending disbelief and it also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripting and how they match don't match reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality if at all br br the documentary or pseudo documentary or fictional narrative whichever you prefer via your interpretations of the themes has its brain in the over educated over intellectual crew its guts in the lost performers struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions and its heart in the director who stands in as the desire to portray to represent to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it it's a film that purposefully repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities it's a film that sometimes shows the multiple shots simultaneously just to leave the editing to the audience and also reveal how disturbingly different shots change perspective br br it's an important work and something that everyone interested in the industry and process of film making should watch and understand it like many experimental films has no real mass audience appeal it's not for them it's for the industry and its for the 60s asking what to do with a group effort medium that still relies on a single voice and author br br polarisdib
<START> a kinda remake of planes trains and automobiles in a lot of ways i think i think it's such a bad and sad coincidence that both john candy and chris farley left us when they still had a lot of stuff to do god bless them both i think the plots of 2 movies are really similar road trips of two different poles of characters and a lot of unlucky consequences because of the this movie can not be planes trains and automobiles but its a really entertaining movie especially with the great performance of chris farley the missing part in this movie is the touchy stuff if we compare it with candy martin classic but i think its better this way
<START> i was pleasantly surprised with this one it's actually quite interesting and engaging the cast is strong even dan cortese brooke shields has come into her own as an actress black and white must have really set her free 'cause i have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character if marketed right could be a medium size hit
