<START> with two old friends br br i've always enjoyed both lemmon's and films and of course their team efforts are always worth watching and often hilarious br br although i didn't personally regard this film as in the hilarious category it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots br br brent spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical cruise director br br gloria dehaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive
<START> being an american service member please believe me when i say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our soldiers sailors airmen marines returning from deployments br br that being said br br this movie is one large steaming pile of clichÃ© the acting as awful with the exception of the little girl the character's backgrounds are weak and laughable and plot is ludicrous br br this movie is so bad i made an account with imdb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it br br canadian writer director francesco should be really really really ashamed of this movie if he disagrees with us foreign policy he should write a letter to the us government not punish the entire english speaking world with a monumentally crap film
<START> words cannot describe how asinine juvenile and repetitive this steaming pile of a series is it relies on 3 things 1 constant 80s pop culture references 2 the tired stretch out a joke to the point of awkwardness bit and 3 at least 3 or 4 pointless flashbacks per episode the only reason i can see for this crap fest being as popular as it is for the constant pop culture references which i suppose elicit an omg lol that's from superfriends that is so totally ironic and i am so edgy and smart for getting it response from the viewer the writing is beyond lazy and panders to its viewers mostly in their 20s and 30s plus there's the character design which seems to consist of the same three characters with the same bored expressions drawn over and over again but with different skin colors and maybe a different hairline occasionally insulting crap
<START> the riddle as a concept is an interesting idea but i'm afraid is miscast vinnie if given the hard man role is his element as in lock stock and snatch in this movie vinnie plays a newspaper sports writer to be precise who during the course of the movie is easily is beaten up with ease and bundled over a balcony by a man who 10 15 years his senior i'm sorry vinnie is tough looks tough and has so to cast him like this is foolish trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the thames he takes on the role of policeman whilst the real police are bit part players with flashbacks from charles dickens br br when vinnie is on screen his reputation precedes him he looks tough but does'nt in this part need act tough snarling at the camera in parts if you watch the mean machine he is perfectly cast and believable and does a very decent performance br br getting back to the movie what confuses the matter somewhat is the flashback to charles dickens who is narrating a different story with characters who are also appear in present day these two stories are it appears unrelated apart from the same actors are used br br the sound on the movie especially from julie cox is inaudible at times and not really fleshed out what her role in the movie is short of love interest she starts the film as a but quickly becomes the girlfriend br br the death of the prostitute is sort of answered but yet not answered strip out the charles dickens stuff and you may have a decent movie br br vinnie is slowly becoming steven segal stick to the supporting actor role your'e quite good at it
<START> needful things was one of my favorite stephen king books but this movie is one of the worst book to film adaptations i have ever seen they changed so many things around that it made me sick even the concept of the book being deception things not always what they appear reminder throughout the book was not shown in the movie althogh it was enjoyable as many stephen king films are but as many stephen king films this one did not follow the book and became a piece of hollywood trailer trash 2 10
<START> unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that jim carrey producing and starring and brian have worked on together but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs basically dick harper carrey thinks he is being promoted to a better job that's until the company of sinks and closes down now dick and his wife jane tÃ©a leoni and their son of course are in trouble with money no matter what they try they can't raise the kind of money they really want so they start robbing a few places and then they decide to rob the guy that set dick up his ex boss jack mcallister alec baldwin i think the most laughable bits are when carrey's in the elevator singing i believe i can fly and the bit when he ties up someone in a robbery and is speaking with a voice changer he sounds like a crap robot okay
<START> i watched this movie for the hot guy and even he sucked he was the worst one well okay i have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too he was even worse the guy wasn't that cute in the end he had the most terrible accent and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that can't stand up to his mom for the one he loves there's ever been overall and if this makes any sense to you when i go to pick up movies at the video store i think to myself as i read the back of a movie that looks so so well at least it can't be worse than carolina moon the most terrible movie and the most terrible writing acting plot everything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips it was the most horrid movie i will ever see with way up there too i hated it and trust me if there was any number under 1 imdb had for rating i'd choose that in a heartbeat
<START> apart from the low budget there never seems to be more than 50 germans in one scene at any one time plus the same 2 half tracks this film is absolute top class everything is accurate that is the point i think from the uniforms to to the horror and the disillusionment everyone is as grey as the field grey uniforms grey men with the life drained out of them forget us made gung ho rubbish like blackhawk down and private ryan this is one of the best war films ever only cross of iron beats this for tension and story please could we have a proper un dubbed german language with english subtitles version in the uk without having to pay ridiculous import charges from europe most other dvd's are multilingual why not this one
<START> wow was this version of the racketeer tough to watch while none of the other reviews have mentioned this the public domain version i watched was seriously flawed the sound track was off by about 10 seconds meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching so you'd hear something occur well before you saw it a very confusing proposition the worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxi br br while this seriously marred the film it also made concentrating on the dialog easier and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well the dialog was simply awful often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling as one review said it was like watching a high school play part of this is understandable as sound was a new medium but this film's dialog was bad even compared to other 1929 films really bad and like many of these early sound films the film was just too talky with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action and you'd think with a title like the racketeer that there would be some action however it's really a sappy romance with very little action br br the film finds carol lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician she herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him and the crook robert armstrong comes to her assistance when armstrong catches her cheating at cards he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet and naturally he falls for her in the process the problem is that once the drunk sobers up he too wants lombard and she needs to choose between them wow a recovering drunk or a mobster talk about a couple great prospects overall it's a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print i saw however even if you ignore this the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature and it was sappy too boot
<START> this is an early one from the boys but some people may not be satisfied with this one like all the others i found it to be different somehow than the your average stooge slapstick it was more funny for it's jokes rather than the poke in the eye or slap watch for a hilarious part when larry grabs the stethoscope from moe and sings into it moe gives him a good smack that part made me crack up for a good ten minutes another hit for the stooges
<START> what an atrocity i am not one to demand total verisimilitude from a movie but the plot and screenplay of killing zoe are so artless that i found myself wincing through the entire mercifully short ninety minutes of the film br br readers of these reviews will by now have figured out the plot zoe a call girl who falls in love with american zed is also an employee at the bank that zed will help rob in a high stakes bastille day heist br br the film strains one's credibility from the get go zed and night of magic is highly prosaic and claims to have experienced the orgasm of a lifetime would seem to reflect the screenwriter's lingering teenage fantasies more than any actual on screen chemistry complete indifference when his friend eric throws zoe out of the hotel room hardly sets the stage for their later strong attachment br br in act two eric's band of bohemians drug addled losers leading a marginal life of petty crime prepare for their big heist with a night on the town here roger main goal seems to be to prove that he knows something about drugs a secondary thread involves convincing us by endless repetition that eric is really really glad to see his old friend zed again really glad eric's devil may care over the top flamboyance and affection for zed isn't even remotely believable check out for example his phony bemusement at discovering a dead cat in his apartment building development of the characters who will accompany us through the rest of the film is an afterthought br br the heist is a disaster understandable since the plan is laughable and the criminals are complete amateurs this is where continues to pay tribute to his idol quentin tarantino by showing that he can be more violent than violent in reality though he's just more boring than boring to build up the excitement there is an extra security guard hidden inside the main safe this was boring in video games and it's boring now br br zoe is taken hostage during the heist but despite our expectation that she'll play a pivotal role she just sits pretty or more precisely fails to do anything with her in literally the last five minutes she springs to life breaks the hostage situation and saves the grateful but still dazed zed from suffering any consequences of his crime why she doesn't mind his involvement in the crime or why she gives a damn about him at all is impossible to tell after all she's had no chance to see that he's any more decent than the rest of the gang br br throughout the dialogue is stilted and phony much of it is in french as a native speaker i can that it doesn't ring even remotely true eric's sugary sweet discourse rapidly alternating with tough guy boasting is meant to be at turns charming and scary but is instead just grating meanwhile his scaredy cat accomplices are more scooby doo than thomas crown when eric is gunned down in a ludicrous example of excessive force we can all breathe a sigh of relief like the bank hostages we will soon be freed from this miserable ordeal
<START> i always try not to be harsh while criticizing something that i didn't like but after watching this mini series i was so disappointed that could not help my irritation on the one hand it is true that series stayed faithful to the novel and of course i found that very nice but on the other hand terrible casting poor acting especially of key characters Â like funny price impression of stage play i mean theatrical way of acting makes you irritate from the beginning to the end i am sure with this budget even if it was low could have been done something much better and worthwhile it is up to you to watch this series but personally i don't advice you to spend your time on this disappointing
<START> as other reviewers have noted this movie is a cross between i e stolen from stories we have seen before specifically this looks like clint eastwood in high plains drifter inserted into mad max remove clint's cigar and replace with a cigarette remove his horse and give him a high tech motorcycle and voilÃ  an updated drifter in this movie the hero is even more blatantly a savior than high plains drifter now our hero has long brown hair suffers a wound to his left side and his entry into town is preceded by a plea for salvation by the surviving townspeople a pretty transparent reference to a second coming i watched the movie on a hot humid morning sleep was impossible and upon arising at 4 30 am there was nothing else on tv so the movie served its purpose while unoriginal with characters that are almost comic caricatures the movie is still somewhat entertaining at least at 4 30 in the morning
<START> this is one of the best bloke movies from the early 90's and whilst slightly dated its one of those movies that would never get made today which makes it very special in fact a very similar movie was made in the 90's called masterminds and it was a pg variation on the same theme but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that matter br br so what's so special about this film it's the between the main characters and the against all odds theme of the film sean astin is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 80 90's particularly the goonies he also went onto greater things with rudy and the lord of the rings trilogy but encino man is a good trip down memory lane will wheaton from stand by me lends nice support to the film and andrew divoff is a terrific villain louis gossett jr sleepwalks in his role but he does add some brevity to the film particularly his relationship with astin's rebellious nature br br so how's the action by today's standards it's rather tedious and cheap looking almost like a tv movie but the production values are good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving school students however the director makes up for the limited budget with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humor br br so park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action flick but don't expect oscar material
<START> i rented this movie not knowing what to expect but whoa was i in for a treat br br for anyone who like myself was waiting for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi it is time to rejoice because the wait has finally ended writing acting filming and directing all top notch i hate to admit it but i actually cried at one point when dracula was talking to the crippled guy truly an emotional roller coaster from start to finish the corridors of the ship provided the perfect spooky setting for this tale and the actors were really able to make their fear come alive to me and coolio as a vampire very nice br br and believe me as great as the bulk of the movie was the ending will blow you away i know this movie gets a lot of flack on this site for some reason but i know none of you saw the ending coming brilliant
