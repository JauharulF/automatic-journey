<START> fantastic russian wwii movie like most russian wwii movies the ascent is incredibly harrowing it's also dense in its symbolism the story follows two partisans and boris and vladimir who go on a mission to search for food on their trip they are spotted by german soldiers who wound in turn kills one of the germans which leads to trouble for the two partisans and everyone else they later run into the greatest success of the film is its vivid sense of place russia is frozen and snowy and it's hard not to feel that cold go straight to your own bones keeps her shot close to the characters examining every of their faces it was probably not the choice but the film is framed 1 33 1 which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia while the entire film is quite an achievement i did feel that the first half was stronger than the second my main complaint about the movie is that it develops into a very unsubtle christian allegory by its climax i just don't think the symbolism adds much to the proceedings especially when i was already intrigued by the debate between the two partisans it's not quite fair i was weighing the pros and cons of their argument i began to lean toward the point of view of a certain character and then the director pops up and tells me that he's judas despite some heavy handedness this is still a must see
<START> in the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several powerfully portrayed emotions a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live in old daughter a piano teacher and professor of music 's love for her pupils expressed in unswerving critical appraisal the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer within this short space of time our senses have been assaulted convincingly with very real characters we are also swept away by powerfully performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance such material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film of widespread appeal but the trend in french cinema being what it is it goes deeper exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent breakdown within a context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of real abuse we are drawn to her suffering and at least initially wonder how much suffering may be related to the accomplishment of genius particularly in the composers she admires the piano teacher contains graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people might rather not watch the scenes are essential to the dilemmas which the film seeks to raise and so can hardly be called gratuitous a great film it may be but mainstream viewing it is not
<START> one of those films that i happened across through the criterion collection and as usual indulged as a change of pace that turned out to be a great decision i was almost mesmerised by the quality of the film the story it told and the way it was told the almost minimalist feel to the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a whole evocative level to the film this really is a superb film to spend some time with and enjoy
<START> please don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a motion picture the only way i could see someone watching this is if they are a die hard fan of erika but you would be better off surfing the internet than to watch this piece of crap i would rather watch paint dry than go through watching this br br they lure you in with casper and erika and lead you to believe it is a sci fi dracula movie but it quickly works out to be a farce about van helsing's great great you get the point grandson here ironically for one last show down between himself and dracula br br the movie also tries to make a political statement i believe when it appears that none of the characters in the future know who god is that they have not been taught about him and don't understand when they see a cross could have done a lot more with this idea it's a shame it turned out the way it did
<START> i usually enjoy underground movies and antiheroes but this is a bad joke i wonder how this can be called a movie all these people are and the filmmaker doesn't succeed in making them interesting at all they are not funny not tragic just plain stupid and boring br br may be i missed something but i won't watch it again to find out what anybody with a camcorder can do better than that br br i give it a 1 for the originality all the rest is crap
<START> mind you it's not supposed to be but it is as a wee tot i watched this movie in the theatre being a huge wrestling and hulk hogan fan all i remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater and that i didn't really like it very much i blacked the rest out and for good reason br br a poor film on par with the greats like gymkata and the no holds barred is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling well maybe the stakes aren't all that high and quite frankly i feel dirty just calling these people professionals at anything and really except for the first scene there's no wrestling to speak of so i guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating the c out of people sounds good right br br hulk hogan plays rip the champion of the wwf never let it be said that hulk hogan was typecast this and movies like thunder in paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents essentially he's playing himself but with a wardrobe that's more black and blue than the red and yellow he also has this hand gesture he does it's kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts except you stick your thumb in the air and you curl your index finger in my friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an r try and see for yourself if that looks like an r well then mars needs women but anyway br br kurt fuller with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz plays a tv exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting rip who's bigger than elvis on his network he won't have any of it and exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera and so the movie follows fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at rip he does so when he creates his brilliantly titled battle of the tough guys marketing genius this guy br br from the numerous hand gestures to the rather idiotic fight scenes all played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious to the overacting to the far too frequent shots of hulk in nothing but undies this movie has everything you'd ever want in a dumb movie it's frivolous not too taxing on the mind violent and includes the phrase what's that smell dookie dookie br br a classic for all time
<START> i didn't know what to expect when i started watching this movie by the end of it i was pulling my hairs out this was one of the most pathetic movies of this year in fact in the last ten years david dhawan should just give up his career as a director i am yet to come across one original script that david dhawan has worked on this one was a complete bit y bit rip off hitch i have nothing against remakes as such but this one is just so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one which was pretty decent i fail to understand what actors like salman and govinda saw in this script i read somewhere that this was supposed to be govinda's comeback vehicle if thats true then only god can save his career salman just overacted to the hilt govinda who i think is an actor of very high caliber was completely wasted katrina kaif and lara dutta had nothing to do apart form wearing designer clothes and smiling for no rhyme or reason please stay away form this one
<START> red spectacles br br i loved avalon i think this director has made some awesome demented visions of the future this film however was boring pretentious crap the opening scene showed great promise for what the cover art and description promise a surreal live action style future noir i feel i got that with avalon br br with red spectacles i was only driven to feel a uncomfortable to desire to what the hell the point was the film barely made sense to me and i could not care less about the people in it this would all be ok if the film was effective art while the opening scene looked interesting and the scene with the giant robot suit person holding the giant machine gun in the rain looked cool it did not watch the film worth watching br br thumbs down
<START> caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly held classic people have criticised the film on a lot of grounds but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not caddyshack br br i would begin by saying that we should just take caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits but i think that would be unfair the movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor the class related themes of versus and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie the two things that are truly lacking here are bill murray and rodney dangerfield who are replaced with dan ackroyd and jackie mason respectively br br now i am not about to try and argue that ackroyd comes close to murray in the movie but jackie mason is an admirable successor to dangerfield he comes off as a cross between dangerfield and arnold but without biting too heavily on either i wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as dangerfield is in caddyshack but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film br br chevy chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie which is another common complaint maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie for my money his scenes here are a lot funnier if somewhat over directed br br while i'm on the subject it is really the over direction of this movie that brings it down it comes across as far more self conscious in its attempts to get a laugh many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the gopher who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny br br characters are similarly hammered home particularly the smarmy yuppy kids jackie mason rarely misses a beat and is consistently likable and very funny but we didn't need the tango sequence at all the director is clearly not of the same school of thought as harold ramis not to suggest that caddyshack was subtle but the jokes here are just a little overcooked and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue br br all things considered this is a fun goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying don't be put off by the appallingly low rating on imdb check it out for yourself
<START> william who directed one of the most exciting silent films ever made 1927 here returns to the skies with another rip roaring story of dare devil fliers had been an air ace in world war one and no one knew like he did here they are stunt flying crashing exploding in the air and everything you can think of plus a fascinating glimpse of commercial air operations in 1932 as well and there is a good strong story excellently played by the sombre richard the silent star who made several films with d w griffith sally and tom brown is a real such a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character instead of one of those botoxed dummies who play in movies in today's hollywood and all look identical the story is a sad one played with genuine pathos and well directed towards the end of the film there are some extraordinarily thrilling scenes of danger and rescue and what must be the most ingenious blind landing in thick fog ever thought of i dare not give away the ingenious aspects of that particular episode the character played by is very like himself a truly wild hell raiser in the air anyone who likes early aviation would love this film and it's very rewarding for anyone who likes good solid entertainment love tears and non stop action all combined in a kind of delectable omelette
<START> the first half of this movie was quite good it was interesting and suspenseful the second half was pretty bad the comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic nazi characters and some badly acted good guys blowing them away there's a lot of violence in this movie i'm not squeamish about violence but i think it should at least have some purpose in a movie there was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles we're somehow supposed to be amused by this br br i watched reservoir dogs recently there was a movie where violence was employed effectively it was realistic within the world the movie created there were never any over the top sound effect it was a crime movie which played it straight inglorious basterds should have played it straight but didn't i was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face br br none of the back story of any of the basterds is really explained either they're simply nazi hunters we don't really get to like any of them either because they're too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face it's all about revenge and very little else br br there was 2 1 2 hours to work with here but few of the basterds were really examined in depth this seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple we saw that in tarantino's last flick death proof which i didn't care for either it suffered the same problems the characters were almost interchangeable br br the first half again was pretty good i wanted to see the exploits of the inglorious basterds across europe i was presented with a much lamer movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in france
<START> rowan atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless mr bean who never goes far without his teddy bear the appeal of mr bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence we don't know if he came from the sky or another planet he is the kind of strange character that you can't make up quite easily he is often alone and used to it he has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times there are other characters who speak to him and he responds the character of mr bean is a mystery and still is he lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing mr bean is rather an odd man out who does not mind it much he rather live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time
<START> non stop action and just about every conceivable and inconceivable sci fi horror cliche can be found in this blatantly silly but fun big budget epic the pace never lets up especially in the shorter us version which tightens things up considerably
<START> attention possible spoilers br br this film is so lousy that it actually becomes funny the director has put in all the clichÃ©s that have ever plagued b series movies the stupid bimbo nice rack getting caught again and again by the bad guys chief villain smirky and revealing his plots before they happen so they can be ruined and who of course bullied killed the hero's father in an unclear past a side kick in the person of a policeman small bald and whose only preparation for the last battle another clichÃ© is returning his baseball cap rim backwards etc br br the film's end really tops it after the chief villain dies when the hero stoneface jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high they walk out of the building which from the exteriors looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall br br when they exit the building the side kick can't walk being that his right leg appears to be wounded how nobody can tell ten minutes earlier he fell down shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine there is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as where is the villain's body which should lay near the building and why is there no police or even curious folks gathered round the said body br br i could go on forever with the list why does another one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time why do bad guys in general make silly movements when attacking why does the hero look so is there anyone really thinking yes these characters and this plot makes this a film to remember and the actors suck our hero and saviour of the day wears the same expression on his face the whole film that disgusted trying to be cocky smirk must be some copyrighted feat of him br br also thinking that until now 12 of the people having rated this film gave it a 10 makes me full of fear inside they might have been serious and then we're doomed
<START> i'm not sure this review contains spoilers but i'm playing it safe by indicating there might be regardless it's unlikely anyone will watch this film who isn't familiar with the book br br there's an old wisecrack about mightily and bringing forth a mouse comanche moon is such a mouse br br the novel focuses more on the indians than the americans in adapting it for tv and rightly reasoned that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the reds unfortunately there's little in the novel that we don't already know about gus woodrow and their friends so the movie gives us mostly a portentous of what will occur in lonesome dove the indians who have their own story to tell are largely relegated to the background so much so that someone who hasn't read the novel will rightly wonder why it's titled comanche moon br br the novel has no overall story line or much of a point this could have been fixed in the movie by more strongly drawing the contrast between the indians losing their lands and way of life to the encroaching americans who bring this opportunity was missed br br unlike lonesome dove comanche moon has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships at least among the americans the extended scenes with the indians have been largely removed or shortened and for a net four hour film it is remarkably episodic and choppy one gets the feeling the script was originally longer and cut to reduce the production costs br br the screenplay comprises mostly clichÃ©d dialog and platitudes coming from the author of the last picture show it's a startlingly bad script and had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations but did not br br some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered for no obvious reason for example clara cassie shows her intense hatred of woodrow jack by condemning gus for always running off to be with his pard that tart little revelation of clara's sexual jealously is gone then there's the scene where the ur dense woodrow warns maggie not to let jake spoon compromise her the exchange in the novel is shorter and harsher the film tones it down and doesn't portray woodrow as quite the socially stupid emotionally frozen stone he is when i read that scene in the novel i wanted to punch woodrow in the stomach or worse there are other changes some of them understandable inish eyelids are not cut off to do so would like have required expensive cgi but buffalo hump has no hump perhaps it was felt unreasonable to ask wes studi to around such a huge prosthesis and buffalo character is kindler and gentler he is nowhere nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novels br br the only good thing about this near turkey is steve remarkable performance not so much as gus but as robert duvall playing gus it is uncanny he perfectly duplicates duvall's mannerisms and manner of speech without ever appearing deliberate or self conscious as was duvall he is wholly within the character and he actually shows us gus becoming more gus in the third part br br the best thing about comanche moon is that it won't spoil our affection for lonesome dove not just a great western but a great american film br br ps for those who think rachel griffiths was over the top that's the way she was in the book
