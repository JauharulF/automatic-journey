<START> dear mr dante br br dude seriously the title of the show is masters of horror and be that as it may it is supposed to be an opportunity to show of your horror chops to show the world why you deserve to be called a master of the genre appearantly you misunderstood the exercise appearantly you thought it was your opportunity or worse your duty to educate the american public on your political beliefs and your attempt comes off as disgusting overbearing and above all preachy br br the only reason anyone marked your short as a high score is because their political views match yours and they are the type of people that don't mind having that sort of politics shoved down their throat br br i on the other hand don't give a damn what you believe they believe or i believe i just want such obvious not subtle and unfunny not satire messages out of my horror and while there were certainly other masters of horror that were big time disappointments or where i was just generally confused why that director william malone would be considered a genre master yours fails far beyond the rest for just missing the entire point of the series br br so next time can you please just keep your preachy politics to yourself
<START> well to each his own but i thought gibson's hamlet was the most god awful rendition i had ever witnessed as subtly nuanced as a paper bag and as inspired as a call the only reason i watched the movie through to the end was that i held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny no luck br br no disrespect for the supporting cast or for zefferelli's staging but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character i have seen hamlet well portrayed as an african prince as an animated lion as a rough and tumble warrior as a romantic poet etc etc etc but imho this portrayal was just a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams
<START> dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero who takes down the man meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide mind you that these women know karate and are fine foxy ladies br br spoiler the end fight scene is pretty crazy with dolemite ripping the heart out of willy green make sure your copy is unrated br br plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the hamburger pimp reverend mayor queen bee and others the apparel is great and the sets are full of 70's style there are a few mess ups in the production such as boom mikes accidentally appearing among other things but that adds to the charm and laughs br br i would recommend drinking a 6 pack before and during this movie and keeping squares and the man a far distance away
<START> this movie was trying to something but failed miserably all the attempts at suspense were cheap and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes i ended up laughing and making fun of it the whole way through at least i was entertained br br the ghosts are attempting to warn the family so why do they attack the girl whose name i didn't care to remember and what was with the black and white at the beginning i know what they were trying to do but they fell far short and where the heck did that guy john corbett's character come from he just waltzes in from no where in a vast field and why did he suddenly lose it again when the ravens came and if the ravens were a manifestation of the spirits of his family then why did they attack him if it would make him try to kill the family makes no sense so many things in this movie just don't make sense and the acting ain't too pretty on the part of the main girl character it's not terrible just a little like her kiddy movie days br br so all in all this movie wasn't brilliant but i had a good time ripping at it and sometimes that's all a horror movie needs to do rent for entertainment not quality
<START> uninspired pretty much all around the only exceptions were a couple emotional scenes with keena violet with whose performance i was pleasantly surprised and occasionally moved beyond that it ended up being little more than a bad flick
<START> based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it i think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a great movie it has its interesting moments for one thing it was filmed on location in colorado was it breckinridge or i can't remember but it is in the credits the location is absolutely stunning and spectacular it's beautiful even to me who lived in colorado for several years br br next it has disney's penchant for wonderful character actors harry morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a disney movie he is literally hysterical also remember the wonderful mary wickes although she has a bit part in this movie she is great as always if you don't know who she is think of the animated disney version of hunchback from notre dame she was one of the gargoyles and she was also the most interesting nun in sister act as well as the best nun in the trouble with angels she has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve br br in addition to character actors and all star casts in the 1960s 1970s disney may have not had the greatest movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will notice that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it the entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem at least 1 or 2 in every single live action movie disney ever made whether it's harry morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or tim conway floundering around or joe flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good the whole film may not be good but there are always hysterical moments in every disney film from this period that i have ever seen disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film br br on these comments i disagree with viewers who say every disney movie in this time period is awful that statement it not quite accurate rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots br br some live action disney movies are true classics old yeller bedknobs and broomsticks mary poppins but for those that aren't i am able to appreciate them for what they were good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive
<START> okay they tell you it's real they don't list any screenwriters or directors but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone it's not real in the way you were hoping for the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk but also down not sound to be scripted possibly loosely scripted to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad lib which they almost always did poorly therefore they knew they were making a 'movie' not just collecting real natural footage so i'm sure these people knew what was going on knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up and they were just told to ad lib around it all br br 'major br br okay it's so lame every item spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare is magically stumbled upon by these people let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that i remember br br 1 less than 2 minutes of entering the house they turn a light switch on the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy br br 2 they happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife in it while exploring the cellar br br 3 they hear a noise in an so they open the door slowly bam a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking br br 4 then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall so let's stick our hand in wow they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape br br 5 let's go to the attic uh oh it feels 'heavy' up here boom a chair flies across the room br br 6 time to eat oh no the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich lol ridiculous br br 7 let's get out the board oops one of the legs on the fell off the side of the board that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it they find out a ghost there is named charles br br 8 wait what was that noise in the chimney clink oh my shackles fell out i think she kept people up here br br 9 now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft oh what's this she sees something and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is swish it falls off straight at her perfect camera shot she moves just in time it was more chain br br 10 now we have to separate and each our designated rooms wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now okay br br chick 1 wow suddenly her room is shaking but no one elses does br br dude 1 actually says to himself charles is that you charles it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you charles well guess what he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor another lucky camera shot br br chick 2 hears things try to communicate and is standing there getting or something br br dude 2 he was in the attic reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter i don't remember what else br br 11 dude 2 runs gets chick 2 they hear chick and dude 1 screaming they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table they leave cut to black final text tell us they escaped safely were treated for minor cuts they have since had nightmares and insomnia we also find out the next day a 911 call was made by they name a someone named charles br br 'major over br br okay when i first heard this movie was being made i couldn't wait i thought it was going to be real real real and more professional with more professional type people i love the idea of this type of thing i'd love to see real haunting footage before this movie was released i saw couple reviews of it by people online they both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were time passed i forgot about the film then i realized it was never released at theaters so i found out it went straight to video rented it found that every brutal review was completely true it's too bad i really wanted this to be good br br random thought the house didn't seem to have tvs radios kitchen appliances that i recall which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time especially the house is truly known for being haunted im pretty sure no one lives there but it looks so clean and tidy and what was a cat doing there the property does not have near by neighbors br br all in all you'll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you you will will be disappointed if you are expecting a good film or real film br br random thought i believe the producer says the you see is real well technically it is real footage isn't it real footage of fake hauntings maybe that was his loop hole br br i give this this movie one star strictly on the fact that they told the story of madame a real new orleans story br br the best performance was by the guy who teaches the participants about the ghost hunting equipment in the beginning he was obviously actually real or a good actor br br
<START> eighteen as written and directed by richard bell may have a few too many stories to tell simultaneously for a 102 minute movie to completely succeed but there is such a fine sense of commitment on the part of all the cast and crew that the viewer ends up wanting the movie to work and so it does yes aspects could have been if the producers had more money to spend on the final cut but as a small independent movie from canada this is a tender gently humorous very touching tale about vulnerability and communication and commitment it works on many levels br br in a very well choreographed opening we are voyeurs at a family dinner where obviously something has gone awry and results in a father and two sons taking off in a car and having an accident in which one of the sons is killed with an introduction like that the mood is set for the surviving 18 year old pip son paul anthony looking far too old for credibility as a teenager to desert his family and live on the streets he meets clark clarence a male prostitute who gives pip food and shelter jenny the very fine carly pope who saves him from a bashing by her associate derek ryan mcdonell and becomes romantically entangled with pip and father chris alan cumming in a finely wrought sympathetic role as a priest it is 18th birthday and his father serge traces pip down to give him a present from his deceased grandfather with instructions the gift should be opened on 18th birthday br br pip though drinking too much and full of anger pawns the tape machine but keeps the tape and begins to listen to the words of his grandfather jason voice by ian mckellen who recounts his own 18th birthday in ww ii in france where he now the very sensitive actor brendan fletcher has an experience with a wounded medic named macauley mark hildreth also superb and reflects on his one night marriage with a cabaret singer hannah thea gill of as folk' fame and a fine singer and actress here only for something to live for during the war jason offers succor to macauley as he dies with a beautiful scene of redemption for he two men at the end the parallels of pip and grandfather jason interplay every time pip listens to the tape and lead pip to ultimately alter his view of life and love subplots include clark's isolated existence as a hustler being altered by jeff david in a surprisingly fine film debut who simply wants to be loved by an unexpected pregnancy between jenny and pip by the trust father chris instills in both pip and clark in a good shepherd's manner and by a flashback to the car accident where pip could have saved his brother daniel paul from an abusive act at the hands of his father just before the accident but failed to do so opening his deep guilt and resultant misplaced anger mirrored by his grandfather's taped experiences each of these subplots pulls together at the end creating a sense of closure for each of the people involved br br there are aspects of this film that make it seem like a big budget production the musical score by is performed by the vancouver symphony members the cinematography by kevin van is aptly atmospheric and the general quality of acting by this canadian cast is very fine though paul anthony handles his role well casting a very young teenager in the pivotal main role would have made the story work much better and richard bell with only one other film 'two brothers' on his resume gives promise of a young talent to watch despite the shortcomings eighteen is a worthwhile film and deserves attention grady harp
<START> another try another miss france may be doomed for not being able to produce a good horror movie i mean the least they could do was to shoot the movie in the forest of but even the forest is fake it was shot near paris the subject is useless the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you wish you were deaf nothing could save it br br bad to the bone i wasn't warned i want my money back
<START> this movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time if you suffer from insomnia it is a fool proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time as the movie slowly progresses the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain this effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action sweet babes br br also mr eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage a prime example of this is the scene on the odessa steps for no apparent reason an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer this editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film honestly i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons br br some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed battleship potemkin as one of the greatest movies of all time and truly a masterpiece well i'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs my best guess is that my fellow potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries surely what they meant to say was one of the greatest snooze fests of all time and truly an epic fail br br in conclusion don't waste your time if you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality go to www youtube com and watch a halo 3 montage if i played the movie battleship potemkin in a game of slayer on guardian i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then its dead body peace
<START> bathebo you big dope br br this is the worst piece of crap i've seen in a long time i have just stumbled onto it on late night tv and it is painful to watch really painful how does something like this get made horrible horrible horrible oooooo the toilet is flushing by itself again scary toilet scary toilet scary toilet 1992 doesn't seem like that long ago to me but watching this makes it seem like 1952 i mean its horrible please don't waste your time on the drivel br br scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard scary scary how does this stuff get made
<START> the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors it isn't their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry either br br to me it is the mis en scene of the entire movie the settings the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a whiff of smoke from chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind the ever changing tight fitting of reflects the constraints of decision making the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leads br br the excellent use of mis en scene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters' relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more
<START> i don't ever remember reading sarah plain and tall in school but when my son told me about it and said they watched the movie in class i wanted to see it too i borrowed the video from the library and watched it as a family it was a wonderful story however i didn't know until a few months ago that there were sequels i finished watching those this week i discovered one small oops in the second movie jacob is reminiscing when he was a boy and tells sarah my brothers and sisters and i would dream in winter's end those brothers and sisters don't exist in conversations between jacob and his father but it is a very small oops and i only caught it watching the trilogy the second time around great movie a must see for good wholesome family viewing
<START> like the other guy said it sux you can count the words that have been said in that entire movie on one of your hands too nudity she got naked like 7 or 8 times in a 1 and a half well past the nudity you'll find a porno behind that film he f ked her all movie long bad acting bad story bad language carmen was swearing all movie long so you get out of that movie scenes and dirty language a lot of gaps in the movie a big silence every now and then the only good thing in that movie is the beautiful places were it has been shot otherwise it's an hour and a half of your life that you'll gonna waste so if u gonna watch that movie good luck it really sux
<START> a spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs are coincidentally also evolved and only on this world have not gone extinct yet the survivors of the crash roughly ten bland characters wearing blue white and yellow suits fight for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters br br planet of the dinosaurs is a peculiar movie like i said in my summary above the stop motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors the models are crude but effectively animated and they are much more fascinating and intriguing than these characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and speaking lines from a script that must have been written overnight without a single revision obviously most of the budget was put into the dinosaurs and although there is a fair share of them there's not nearly enough to save us from our boredom these human characters are only there to scream run around and mutter these poorly written and verbose speeches about survival and unfortunately not nearly enough of them get eaten by the dinosaurs br br overall planet of the dinosaurs is not a film i plan on seeing again some people will simply love it for being so cheap and so poorly made sometimes i enjoy movies like this but this particular film is just too long too boring and very exhausting on the mind
