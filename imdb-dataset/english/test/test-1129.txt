<START> parts the horror is a horror all right there are of course the bad fashions of the late 70's there's the really bad acting from dick sargent to peter graves and then there's the clones themselves their days mostly consist of running jumping cycling and wrestling with each other when they're not doing that they learn about america not the band america or the song by neil diamond but an america where they go on to become part of a greater society but they're given some strange drug then they have all their bodily fluids drained general ripper was right and they are placed in the freezer and await thanksgiving or christmas when they will be out and roasted at about 450 degrees or so oops that's not what happens but it would've been a lot more interesting than what's shown mario of super mario brothers fame makes a delightful cameo as a doctor who bickers with dick sargent
<START> the back of my dvd describes the plot of el after his capture in the wilderness the legendary bloodthirsty creature escapes into the city creating mayhem and panic as they pursue the deadly beast an animal control officer and scientist dr realize that a vigilante with his own suspicious plan is also tracking the elusive killer for a mysterious research facility run by the diabolical dr this putrid horror flick is somewhat amusing if you watch it under the influence of alcohol the script is completely silly the acting is wooden beyond belief and the direction is amateurish two rubber suits are easily the best thing about this movie 3 out of 10 and that's being extremely kind
<START> actually i feel like having my review be that one word my friend whose opinions i almost always trust about movies especially horror movies warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was because it was a complete waste of time unfortunately i haven't talked to him in a while and i was in a hurry to pick a movie and thought 'what the heck how bad could it be ' why don't i learn what was i thinking did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rented br br the 'plot' concerns a guy who edits films for some company his boss is a jerk the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the pre credits sequence so for some reason the boss picks nerdy for the special project of editing loose limbs splatter movies he never says what ed is supposed to edit but i guess that doesn't matter ed is upset by some of the clips working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no apparent reason he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project but his boss doesn't care he starts to slowly go insane supposedly from watching the clips and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life or has he been this way all along please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep interesting and coherent than it actually is br br we don't care about the characters at all or have any sympathy for them or even hate the bad guys the plot is really really boring and predictable the splatter isn't even that gruesome or creative this is not worth renting just to see the gore because what there is isn't interesting or original br br all the to sam raimi just come off like really bad ripoffs and no one in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell so you can't distract yourself with that i think an evil dead ii dead by dawn poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam raimi will be flattered and not consider any sort of legal action a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay every time i hear lines like are we having fun yet which even bride of re animator couldn't pull off without making me wince i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation wandering in only to get killed this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining but it was all i could do to keep from fast forwarding through most of it fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing trust me it did not require my full attention i still felt like 90 minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the background br br don't watch it no matter how tempted you are you'll hate yourself for wasting your money horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is even those who haven't seen too many splatter movies should stay away as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while if you want something brainless low budget and fun rent something else complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever be smarter than i was at the time and don't be fooled by the warning not for the faint of heart on the box you have been warned br br
<START> ok so maybe it's because i'm from the north east of scotland and i talk just like the guys in this film but i found this great fun cheap fun to be sure but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all i was actually quite effected when they died in particulare when the captain finally fell the script well it s a game of 2 the opening half of the film is well written and sharp the last half hour is not so great with many questions left unanswered this will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me but nevertheless good fun and a very smart first feature from
<START> said to be inspired from disney's the little mermaid on the cliff by the sea is japanese animation master hayao miyazaki's next big work after the well received spirited away in 2001 and howl's moving castle in 2004 in his signature style of animating fantasy realms and children characters are on display once again br br the boy lead in the film discovers a trapped in a glass jar while playing by the seaside below the cliff he stays with his mum lisa yamaguchi above and atop it shakes the jar forcefully to try and get the out but the little is stuck he then tries to pull it out but it just cannot come loose then place the jar on the ground before smashing a small rock onto it breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger he then checks to see if the is still alive as he observes it the reacts by licking the blood off his finger suddenly excited quickly rushes back to the house and put the in a small bucket of water in hope that it will survive it did and he named it br br the above scene would signify what is to come for the remainder of the film it is of the interactions between and and it is one that hayao miyazaki did meticulously well in portraying he must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before he depicts this chemistry of communication between the two main characters the behavior of the children would also extend into the rest of the film in their further encounters br br the affection between and grew as the film progresses from the moment brought to school in lisa's car the best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief separation when father fujimoto george a magical sea dweller recaptures the errant before encapsulating her in a magic bubble with kind intention br br fujimoto who was once human has grown to refer humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing its life but all wants is to be human and be with so for a second time she escapes accidentally emptying his father's precious store of magical elixir into the sea creating a storm of tidal waves and the small town in the process br br what follows are the adventures of and in the flooded town br br is there a happily ever after in this one would true love prevail you find out br br looking at the art in on the cliff by the sea there appears to be a deviation from miyazaki's past works in terms of rendering it looks unfamiliar because the environment apart from the characters at play in every scene is not colored in the usual fashion as in spirited away 2001 and howl's moving castle 2004 the aesthetical appeal is discounted from what appears to be color penciled drawings the objects and characters are also not as detailed as before br br this is peculiar if taken on face value but from the way the story is written and told the possible explanation is that miyazaki is allowing the audience to view the film with a child's tint yet allowing the adults to reminisce on a japan when they were younger this move could have prevented prospective moviegoers new to miyazaki's work to see it the trailer did nothing to promote as well taking the case to japan however would be a different story as miyazaki's credential far than exceed any marketing technique br br in summary though the whole did not equal to its parts aside from miyazaki's ability to cast vivacious and animated characters the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder when measured against previous works resulting in a deficit of big screen presence br br the sparks of and failed to light up the film in a big way but moments of warmth kindness and love can still be found in recognizing the film as one that is not made for the kids but of the kids who everyone is or once was
<START> br br this film has some really impressive action scenes the humor and action are blended well though the intensity of the film does not sustain itself till the end the last scene is a slight anti climax in terms of action quality and astonishing of the scenes preceding it the humor doesn't seem to be so ridiculously clumsy as in many other hongkong movies and this film is of totally other class than most american action comedies of recent years lau ching wan acts as a typical intuitive police hero who scoffs at invalid orders from incompetent police superiors the dialectic of the film is built on the superhuman coolness and ruthlessness of the drug gang humiliating the police force while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns leaving plenty of corpses in it's wake yu is especially impressive as an ultra cool merciless gangster in this woo like piece of action where tough guys are truly die hard
<START> imagine a world in which everyone treats anyone nicely no foul word is ever uttered office bickering is nonexistent and your boss invites the office crowd regularly to self cooked dinners where you can chat about latest interior design styles everything is neat pleasant well just nice in other words you are in hell after being dropped off in the middle of nowhere mid thirties andreas starts a new job as a book keeper in a small clean city from the beginning he feels foreign in this proper impersonal world of superficial kindness surrounded by pleasant but lifeless interior architecture and likewise colleagues food tastes of nothing drinks don't get you drunk no children anywhere after initial steps of fitting in andreas searches for ways to escape the bland new world he doesn't know where he came from anymore but still remembers rich tastes true feelings anything beyond the non committal life he's leading now the bothersome man resonates ideas of and kafka but here the cruelty is the omnipresent neatness unlike pleasantville this is not about narrow minded bigotry more a fable of our urban free world civilisation of fitting in it mostly reminds one of the ingenious fight club scene in which edward norton walks through a mock ikea catalogue spiced with macabre humour this scandinavian laconic tale convinces on every level story characters and relevance a true screen gem 8 10
<START> larry bishop directs writes and leads this soft core porn plot less biker movie about nothing to do with anything to call this one of the worst movies of 2008 is being kind to the garbage that i spent money on while in theaters its one of the worst movies i have ever seen i felt sorry for the girls mostly who probably think they're in the making of a feature film when in all reality they're making a porno they walk on the set for four days say some sexual lines to disgusting old men thirty years older than them then take off their cloths and run around naked for the four days they're on set i can only assume this was larry bishops only way to get laid you see shot after shot directly on a girls asses shot after shot of bishop walking up to some random chick and grabbing her most intimate parts as if he were shaking her hand how this crap was even funded is beyond me why tarantino has his name on it is beyond me but he's been slowly fading away since 1994 so i can't say i was surprised br br after 15 minutes you get that awful feeling that only horrible and i mean horrible movies give you when you see it in theaters the pain you feel is amplified after 15 minutes i wanted to cry for being so stupid and wasting not only my time but my hard earned ten dollars there isn't one redeeming quality or one moment in the movie that creates any kind of reaction or shows any kind of inclination that these people had any idea of what they are doing if you don't see naked women all that often then i guess this movie would be for you if you're eleven years old you will probably like it you can't even laugh at it because every idiot making it was laughing about the crap they were making the acting is awful the writing is awful the production is awful and the directing is awful it's not even worth your time renting it to see the car crash stay away stay very far away you shouldn't even be reading these reviews i shouldn't even be writing one
<START> this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today horribly predictable obscene usage of slow motion photography cheesy story lines chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment i will give the series some credit though it does get entertaining at times but not enough for it make any difference with all the negative points this series has i still prefer it over reality tv it can't really get any more worthless than that
<START> wow what a lovely warm rural film the story focuses upon mi taylor mickey rooney a young male wanderer whose journey takes him to a quiet rural coastal town there he stays with the brown family velvet liz taylor their youngest daughter who mi subtly befriends has a passion for horses and wins one at an auction this horse is a beautiful stallion referred by its previous owner as a 'murderous but velvet re names him pie not long later velvet suggests to enter him in the grand national race mi and her family are against the idea but soon agree and velvet and mi began to train him for britain's most famous horse race Â this film is a beautiful example of what british films are like i remember i first saw this when i was eight and on my summer holidays my parents taped it off the tv and i warmed to it instantly Â watching it most days instead of the large collection of disney films that i owned br br i believe it was one of liz taylor's first movies and a good one her character is naÃ¯ve but sweet Â her acting is extremely convincing especially when she portrays her love for horses it's also a good chance to see angela lansbury in one of her early roles who co stars as older sister who spends most of her time in the film being smitten with a boy in the town i must say she was a gorgeous lady when she was younger beautiful blonde hair and a rosy cheeked face although she doesn't have a major part in the movie she dose have a number of scenes so not to disappoint her fans parents reading this i must emphasis Â if you can get hold of a copy of this please do if you're children love animals Â i strongly suggest you show it to them they may find a few scenes boring but you see velvet riding the horse on many occasions throughout the film and would most defiantly entertain children a lovely and nostalgic film i might just go away now and put it on
<START> before i really slag this film off i just want to say i absolutely loved it br br firstly how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase you're right i'm sure i was counting in the hundreds before i gave up and started watching the film again br br secondly what the hell is with those blue monkey things ok so the family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie creatures br br and finally 'old faithful here will protect me' hahaha
<START> i'm having as much fun reading the user comments as i did watching the movie it seems that this is the classic either love it or hate it movie and i have to say that i not only am on the love it side i'm going on a limb to say it this my favorite movie ever thank heavens i found it in the first place almost impossible to find i was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night uhf channel of course my liking of sellers may make me a bit biased but i can't see how anyone with a cornball dry sense of humor like me can not be in love with this flick the plot is great but perhaps as a previous poster said maybe the reason why it's not a widely known movie upset the medical field the acting is great i can see why some may say the acting was horrible but that's what made this movie so great it's total tacky ness and the humor is gut busting i'm proud to say i have watched this film no less than about 20 times and have pretty much every line memorized this film is genius
<START> the only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of romance if you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another nicholas sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of previous films such as message in a bottle nights at and a walk to remember think again nobody dies from an accident trying to save somebody else and the romance here doesn't transform these characters if anything it makes them even more miserable than they were br br a soft spoken special forces army sergeant john channing tatum of g i joe has a memorable two week fling while on leave from the military with an impressionable college girl savannah curtis radiant amanda of mia who is spending spring break in south carolina savannah doesn't drink smoke but she tells john that her head is filled with profanity inevitably john and savannah topple madly in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep inducing by any standard is off in the world serving the military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is away at college perusing his letters in class just as they are getting hot and heavy between them suicidal terrorists crash planes into the world trade center john along with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with savannah br br meanwhile another guy shaggy but likable family friend tim henry thomas of e t the extra terrestrial who has a autistic child named alan becomes the object of sentiment she is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children she delays what seems forever before she finally contacts with the eponymous letter indeed she dumps him for a man with a disease later she confesses to john that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken her resolve to marry tim so she doesn't make that fateful call predictably john agonizes over lack of communication during a routine mission our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in germany while all this is transpiring is trying to come to terms with his own coin collecting father mr richard jenkins of step brothers who suffers from syndrome it seems that his father is on his last legs after john gets out of the hospital the lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of amounts to a pretty low blow his father and commander keith robinson are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance romance br br dear john gives new meaning to lethargic love stories yuck
<START> i remember seeing this at my local blockbuster and picked it up cause i was curious i liked movies about mythological creatures i like movies about werewolves vampires zombies etc this is based on half caste a half human half leopard creature that preys on the people of africa br br the movie is horrendous the actors are terrible there is no script whatsoever it's all improvised the whole thing is filmed at night because they say that is the only time you ever see it it's obvious bull bleep they film at night to make it scary but they have failed to scare me after the first person was killed i put this back in the case and took it back to blockbuster one of the most boring movies i've ever seen br br now you are probably saying i have no right to review a movie if i haven't finished it well this is one of the films that didn't deserve to be watched all the way through br br 1 star out of 10 this is really bad
<START> okay so i forgot to watch and only caught the last episode thinking it was the first or second honestly i thought cm would have at least one more installment to resolve plot points the rangers are left stranded on the plains we'll have to eat the horses for one thing little newt is bereft for another what a downer ending but my biggest complaint esp if this was the finale is that the episode had no suspense no big climax no dramatic confrontations even the last fight between blue duck and buffalo hump was badly staged the whole episode had terrible pacing which is what drives a western steve was watchable karl urban a ringer for johnny knoxville played call like a man with a terminal case of lockjaw all looks and spurs and jutting chin and what's with the rangers they talked big about cleaning up texas then around aimlessly in the middle of town getting drunk and how nice of hal holbrook to loan val kilmer his mark twain wig and the set of austin was like the fake rock ridge from blazing saddles all facade i admit i was drawn into the plot but that's mainly cause there were many things i didn't quite get thanks to coming in late in story if i'd watched from the beginning i might not have gotten to episode three now i have to go watch silverado to cleanse my palette
