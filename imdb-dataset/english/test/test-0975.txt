<START> feeling minnesota is not really a road movie but that's still the best i can generate a road movie does not primarily depend on a great story line and since the plot of this movie is truly pathetic it does fulfil that description to be interesting such a movie must rely entirely on moving and intriguing characters and on the chemistry between them unfortunately the staff of feeling minnesota fails utterly in producing this excitement br br the presentation of the characters is unsatisfying and confusing i can for example not figure out whether keanu reeves did grow up in the house of his mother and brother or not it is said by his mother tuesday weld that he must live with his father but nothing in the film suggests that it ever happens the same goes for the rest of the characters i never get to know them they appear irrational and no real explanation is given to why they do so br br the bottom line is that i leave the movie without any feelings for the characters except dullness and perhaps a tiny kick of attraction for the cute cameron diaz
<START> i was still living with my parents when they aired this on dutch tv usually i was the one watching movies with the other's not caring but somehow we all sat down and watched this movie this kinda movie used to be aired at wednesday evening it is the story of a woman who'll die soon but before she dies she wants to make sure her many kids will have the best possible foster parents so we were watching this and my dad the most emotional of the four of us started to cry i followed almost immediately and before long my sister and mother were teared up too there we were totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story if you want a good cry this is the one for you
<START> br br oh my word i have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum michael winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung ho world of deep and damaged execution not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the bronson but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question are you enjoying this and even though you'll tell yourself no it can't be you'll know that deep down inside you'll know it's a masterpiece
<START> to begin with i have to admit i've never been a big fan of the dutch movie genre unfortunately watching de hasn't made me change my mind it shares some common flaws like having a plot that's too predictable and linear for my taste br br worse however is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were stage actors in a play unfortunately this is common too in many dutch movies and at least to me makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters br br the actor that plays i'm sorry i forgot his name at the moment is at least delivering a decent performance and is one of the reasons i don't rate this movie even worse another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget and the production seems professional br br ironically the fact that the acting is often too articulated might not be so much of a problem if you don't speak dutch although i already warned you that the plot isn't spectacular either but at least it might make it an acceptable movie to watch
<START> i watched six of a kind for w c fields he's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville and several other great moments the 55 minutes are also delightful thankfully mostly due to the hilarious charlie as the bumbling banker j he is everyone's foil he stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure also his comedy partner mary boland plays his wife flora joining in the proceedings are george burns and gracie allen boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end but gracie and use up most of the picture gracie's funny quite but she can also get tiring and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time i don't remember laughing at him once although he has one great scene with where tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while and one with fields where he asks fields to sell him a sweater that bit is exclusively fields' though the situation is constantly funny the are going to drive to california but to help them with expenses george and gracie are recruited 8 10
<START> i watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed although i like this film and was engrossed by the story i did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat br br the story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic policewoman the location is a quaint korean village br br this film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic however i was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman yet does not even give her the choice to enter his life in my mind he is a sweet noble loser br br good points excellent acting by the two main leads enjoyable snapshot of village life br br cons flat ending br br overall good but i prefer the before sunrise and after sunset films or is it before sunset and after sunrise
<START> having worked professionally with young girls on the run i found this film surprisingly authentic i would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape there are classic themes here coming of age mother daughter estrangement the limited choices of the underprivileged who is the good samaritan tragedy is in every life the many layers or relationships flashbacks are meaningful when alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it and it does not end in clichÃ© the cast really sells their roles it is adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy allow it 15 minutes to so to draw you in

<START> the best of everything just what is the best of everything it is different for everyone but for most of us it is love but alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love this story goes the whole gambit of looking for love sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons but as the saying goes we are the captains of our own ships and so it goes for our lives we are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives once we make those choices then we must live with them as we watch this story and as we see these women making choices that most likely change their lives forever we wonder would we make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser who knows
<START> tamara just felt like another teen oriented knock off of the i know what you did last summer trend and is painfully dull a high school outcast who is heavily into witchcraft and black magic is accidentally killed during a cruel prank carried out by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods vowing to tell no one the next day the supposedly dead tamara arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her would be killers and has a little revenge this is basically a combination of carrie the craft and every other straight to video teeny bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days the actors are absolutely atrocious and look about ten years too old to pass off as high schoolers there is some gore which is actually nothing all that interesting since the movie is so boring and i couldn't wait for it to end if you like modern garbage than i insist you seek this one out otherwise don't bother
<START> i didn't want to write this movie off on the reviews and critics in the western world i mean how wrong have they been about asian cinema that has now become a staple diet of the hollywood remake monster plus jet l is pretty damn cool and he's made some interesting movies in asia so with an open mind i was surprisingly averaged out by this movie br br there are good points the story is very clever using m theory as a base to bring forward the plot that there are multiple universes each with their own versions of worlds and most likely you each time one of you is destroyed the rest share the energy and power amongst them the idea that someone might try and purposely become the only version of themselves in all the universes to find out if they become a god br br there's also jet li and he's not a bad actor and pretty nimble as a martial artist plus jason statham who is an all round good actor as for the special effects some of them are really cool a mixing of bullet time and slow motion with normal speed very cool to watch in places br br the bad points well statham's accent is appalling and some of the effects aren't as comparable as others so it's quite apparent that money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably deemed as too short on screen or they just plain ran out of budget br br a big sore point for me is the close cropped camera action that hollywood has long favoured something that jackie chan has often talked about filming fight scenes close up serves two purpose it gives greater emphasis on a single punch or movement making it look harder and more real than it really is and it also hides what is going on around the camera lens for example people holding a fake arm or the face of a stunt double etc br br what chan always said was that he tried to open out the camera and show the audience what was going on let them see the people fighting properly rather than a close up of a face and a fist cutting to someone falling into frame showing the whole picture is more effective and it's more impressive br br so the close cropped shots were just more annoying than anything you failed to see the impressiveness of li's fighting skills and you found it hard to see some of the action slow the cuts down and pan out the camera hollywood directors the biggest problem was the story though despite having such a strong base on which to build they seemed to loose the sense of the plot and concentrate on the action scenes there are some serious plot building and explanatory moments that are just totally overlooked and covered in the space of a few sentences yet these could have formed some excellent and complex character development br br it just all held together too weakly and not enough was made of the story all in all not a great movie and it's potential was badly spoiled
<START> this world war ii popeye cartoon had some very good sight gags in it and its decidedly above average for its genre it was nicely drawn too with some great angles good detail and well lots of interesting sights br br what it amounts to is popeye out at sea in his little boat and accidentally running into a small japanese boat with two guys on it incidentally why were the japs always pictured with big round glasses and bucked teeth br br anyway these harmless looking japanese sailors want popeye to sign a peace treaty oh boy thinks the gullible popeye wait until the admiral sees this in one of those great artwork scenes i was alluding to above we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big destroyer and popeye is in deep um water why you double crossing ja pansies yells our sailor man br br how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch
<START> i thought this movie was good i loved the plot i loved the shoot out scenes except for a few they were not needed and i also enjoyed character she was a rider i liked that i do have to say that in this gangster movie the actors were picked well because sometimes some actors just don't fit the role however though i hate to say it but i hated the ending i felt as if it should have went in a different direction also it would have been better with a little more details its based on a true story but there was so much of the facts left out but other than that it was good if you enjoy movies on the past gangsters you'll enjoy this movie
<START> the greatest tarzan ever made this movie is done in a way that no other tarzan ever has come close in doing it has every thing in it that you would want in a tarzan movie no other tarzan movie ever has or ever will portray the character this well i would say that if you have seen a tarzan movie and liked it you should see this one you will love it and if you have never seen tarzan you should see this one and forget the rest of them
<START> i'll say it again one of the worst films ever made and it was made by the director that made one of my most favorite films excalibur i was floored to see it got a grade of over six this movie sucks it looked terrible it looked like it was shot in 18 days and boorman must've been sleeping when he directed this arquette didn't do anything just plain terrible rotten unbearable and probably the only blemish in boorman's celebrated career br br 1 10
