<START> having seen rush live i'm able to appreciate the awesomeness of this others may complain of sound problems but it's sometimes over dubbed by the overwhelming screams of 60 000 brazilians and it goes to show the band's territorial gain of attention
<START> this is a god awful norris film with one of the most annoying performances ever in calvin levels and a weak script the characters were terrible and it has hardly any action plus even chuck norris stinks in this christopher is very weak as the main villain and the story was not very interesting plus norris seemed bored with the whole thing and i don't blame him as i was too calvin levels gives one of the most annoying performances in a movie ever i couldn't stand as i was tempted to rip the tape out of my vcr plus norris and levels had no chemistry together if your looking for some great martial art moves from norris don't go near this however if you want a movie with an uninteresting story hardly any action and bad acting look further this is a god awful norris film with one of the most annoying performances ever from calvin levels avoid it like the plague the direction is incredibly bad aaron norris does an incredibly bad job here with no suspense or thrills bland camera work and keeping the film at a dull pace there is a little bit of blood and violence we get 2 gory ripped out heart exploding body and a few gunshot wounds the acting is really bad chuck norris is not amazing as he usually is here and seemed very bored here his one liners are flat and his acting wasn't that great and i am a huge norris fan this is his absolute worst norris still rules calvin levels is incredibly annoying here his whiny wimpy performance severely grated me i was so hoping for him to get it good but sadly he didn't christopher is pretty weak as the main villain his voice was cool but he over acted big time j wilson is beautiful and did okay with what she had to do rest of the cast are terrible overall please avoid this it's not worth the torture even if you are a huge norris fan like me bomb out of 5
<START> i'm not a movie maker but i do know it is hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into the character horses on mars does this and more when you are watching a good movie you don't want it to end this is how i felt watching this film it is visually expansive and the takes on such human qualities that you feel you are on the journey with him br br really looking forward to see what exciting adventures mr anderson takes us on in the future well done
<START> fans of apocalyptic movies will savor this well made low budget thriller that is essentially a remake of the 1951 george pal classic when worlds collide a comet is headed for a near collision with earth and when his fellow scientists disregard his warnings of doom eccentric scientist peter crawford dennis hopper gathers a group of private investors to secretly construct an underground sanctuary br br the story unfolds through the eyes of muscle bound gulf war veteran jake lowe peter onorati who inadvertently discovers crawford's hidden sanctuary and then decides that crawford is wrong for keeping his project hidden from the rest of humanity as the comet approaches the subject of who should live and who should die makes for interesting drama br br while the special effects are not in the same league i enjoyed the story more than i did spielberg's war of the worlds because i feel this screenplay is better some suspension of scientific reality is required but it's worthwhile for the development of a good story i highly recommend this film to fans of the genre
<START> if it is true that sadomasochism is a two sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself her outward expression projects her desire that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse br br along comes talented charming handsome young walter benoit who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity he wants to become her student so as to be close to her she rejects him out of hand but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in he falls in love with her again she pushes him away but he will not take no for an answer and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self respect br br the question the viewer might ask at this point is who is in control the sadist or the masochist indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist it is hard to tell is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment or is it the person who is rushing out the door sated giving the order that no one is to know what happened br br but erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak she is a sex extreme freak she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability actually that isn't even true she says she doesn't care what others think she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love love she calls it for her sex and love are one and the same br br at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything how ironic such a is to her how gratuitous the comment br br the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another this is particularly important in the scene in which erika like a blood drained corpse caught in stark white and black light lies under her lover rigid as stone here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery we don't need to see any more br br the part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes indeed she excels in them i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense what matters to her is the performance and the challenge no part is too demanding no character too depraved it's as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity and wants us to watch her as she does she is always fascinating and nearly flawless she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work br br i think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the la from 1977 when she was 22 years old there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing a parisian apprentice hairdresser her character was shy about sex and modest just an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician here she is a self destructive witch bitter with hateful knowledge of herself shameless and entirely depraved br br huppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets hollywood could never make a movie like this in the american cinema only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles here and also in la 1995 in which she plays a vile spiteful murderess br br do see this for isabelle huppert you won't forget her or the character she brings to life
<START> this movie is a piece of the time in which it was made realistic movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s the producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist the lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that hopefully would spur them on to action at least that's how it seemed at the time in today's movie world this movie would probably not be done there would definitely not be this ending however realistic the sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time
<START> tumbling doll of flesh by is a japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse torture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions typically twisted japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore there is no plot to speak of just plenty of hard core sex scenes optically censored again and lots of blood the special effects are quite impressive the dismemberment of japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail the tongue cutting scene really made me squirm her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines psycho the snuff reels actually reminds me guinea pig flowers of flesh and blood but it's not as memorable so if you're a fan of ultra depraved japanese sickies like all women are whores or raping my virgin slave give this one a look 8 out of 10
<START> this is one of those movies you find when you stay up too late and only have basic cable it's hard to believe this movie was made in '95 considering it looks like something out of the late 80s plucky youngsters with varied home problems face a demented ice cream man who's on a mission to make the best flavor ever soylent cream br br this movie is extremely demented and is only scary in how creepy and absolutely ridiculously gross it is actually the really scary thing about this movie is the nature of the problems these kids face at home the fact that these kids have no escape from their silent suburban sufferings makes any random loony loose in the neighborhood seem like a walk in the park br br the most laughable part of this movie is the fact that the stereotypical fat kid is so obviously a slim pre teen with a mountain of padding under his baggy i guess that either a they hadn't invented couldn't afford a fat suit b the casting director was too lazy to find a pudgy child star or c we are honestly supposed to believe that this child is starving and has an enormously distended belly br br so if you're up at 2 am and need something ridiculous and disgusting to rip on with your intoxicated friends go ahead and take a look personally i'd rather be sleeping
<START> in the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations blade is by far one of the best realised and most faithful overall to the source material given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in marvel's tomb of dracula the writer took almost all of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history while changes were inevitably made the finer points of the film right over any criticisms don't let any of you friends tell you different blade is one fine film if it feels too comic for you stanley kubrick snobs out there it's because it's supposed to deal with it but don't dis it for it
<START> space is a vacuum right therefore space sucks vampires also suck a really bad vampire movie set in space would have twice the sucking power right br br it started with what could have been a fun premise retelling bram stoker's dracula story in the future there's a salvage crew that's sent out to investigate a cargo ship that's lost in space called the fans of the original novel will unwittingly assume that this is to be a straightforward retelling of dracula set in the future unfortunately short of sharing character names this one takes the lowbrow route and goes into the b movie galaxy twenty minutes later when coolio becomes a vampire trust me when i tell you he's the best actor in the movie and that's not saying much br br casper van dien should be his wares on daytime television erika eleniak should have quit after she left baywatch and poor udo kier is having trouble reading from the cue cards the guy who plays dracula in this one is more ridiculous than frank langella was in the 1970's version if you can manage to sit through the whole movie you will be rewarded with the worst ending imaginable the ending makes one wonder if the actors and the crew realized what a piece of garbage they were making and walked off the set br br take heed vampire fans this one sucks twice as hard
<START> not a good one not at all br br this installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the amityville home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of amityville itself br br it's basically nothing my bet is that this film was made for some extra fast cash to buy a boat or something because this one's just ridiculous thankfully it doesn't kill or ruin the series but it just has no effect on the series at all br br i'd have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than the amityville curse
<START> this is the worst kind of film br br the plot is ludicrous the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white child rapists in their 20s good boys and need to be persuaded that this might be grounds for provocation are black people universally inspiring do the ku klux klan really stand outside court rooms shooting at lawyers with nobody intervening do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a mob outside shouting kill him do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the klan waiting to hear the verdict do wives really take several months to realise that their husband might be defending a man from unfair hanging because he knew might have done the same thing do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them do lawyers really use a defense of sanity in order to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane br br worst of all any high minded principles of this film were lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to titillate the audience was the subject of rape let alone child gang rape really in competent hands here is it really a subject that belongs in hollywood hands and if so why the completely gratuitous kidnap and stripping of sandra bullock and the completely pointless statutory rape charge against one of the witnesses seems like the director didn't feel that strongly about sex crime after all br br this was taking the excellent plot of to kill a mockingbird and making a crass shallow tasteless money spinner from it shame on them
<START> this film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain top commune as free men in 17th century brazil the story is interesting and edifying however this film as a film is terrible br br the soundtrack is not period music or tribal music it is afro brazilian pop music from the early 1980s battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas admittedly the lyrics are folk ish tales of the heroism the special effects are absurd rather than invoke the mysticism of african religion and atavistic beliefs they merely make the film look cheap they are completely unbelievable and i don't mean merely in a sense of verisimilitude br br life within the commune of could not have been the way it is portrayed in the film for this society as shown in the film is one part kibbutz one part afro pop festival moreover it is almost embarrassing to watch the director play upon the clichÃ©s of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy he portrays daily life as a series of dance parties in which the freed slaves paint themselves bright colors and whirl around to the strains of '80s pop music on the other hand they have an abundance of beautiful food but the viewer hardly sees any work being done the king against private property in a hackneyed and clichÃ©d way when a man complains that people are taking the vegetables that he has grown over many months the king says what comes from the earth belongs to everyone as the earth belongs to no one if they need food they have a right to take yours br br i am glad that i learned about this episode in history but i am relieved that a film with such low production values and that trades upon such worn stereotypes would likely not be made today
<START> regarded as another one of the recent over the top drama's brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failed especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family they go through so many mother daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities i feel that these two actress' talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of cliche's and really saved the suffering plot i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such over the top drama's
<START> absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in english class this is literally one of the worst films i have ever seen it totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present so the story is just really really dull thank god the 80's are over and god save whatever man was actually born as james bond iii
