<START> i have not seen such a stupid dumb movie since quite a while it absolutely has no logic no horror doesn't scare you no suspense not thrilling i mean i didn't find even one part of the movie appealing br br i don't know what they were thinking when they made the movie you watch the whole movie to find out that there is a plant that can walk around drag human dead bodies and eat human flesh not just that but it can also talk i e imitate sounds like a cellphone ringing or human talking so its like the plant makes the noise of a cell phone ringing so they go after the cellphone and find out its a plant how intelligent of the plant to setup an ambush br br this clearly is the creativity level of a primary school kid bad
<START> after sitting through this film i have decided that it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i knew it the moment i was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and overacting when they omg meet again and then watching the same thing only done by women old enough to be my mom and that was only the first few minutes yeesh so here are my comments br br 1 middle aged women ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and over the top costumes not a good idea br br 2 pierce brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag nor could practically anyone else in this pile of excrement for that matter br br 3 the songs were so random it was obvious to me that they were thrown willy nilly into the incredibly contrived and stupid plot br br 4 my three year old nephew could have written a better script br br i was either cringing or laughing derisively during the movie and i normally really like movie musicals of course they are bound to be a bit corny but this was ridiculous what a waste of talent i mean you have great actors and actresses in this movie i am embarrassed for them that this is now a part of their career i regret wasting my money and time on this piece of crap
<START> diane lane mickey rourke rosario dawson thomas jane not a bad cast in my opinion however they were totally wasted in this movie br br there was no real direction there were no unusual turns in fact the whole movie was very predictable from start to finish mickey rourke had a really annoying sidekick who did nothing but irritate you from the start rosario dawson was totally wasted and there was hardly any point in even having her character in the film br br i really do believe this is one of those straight to dvd movies that everyone will forget about very quickly which is a shame as the movie could have been so much better
<START> i read the book after seeing the movie and didn't care for it finding it somewhat trashy but trashy books often make good movies and this one certainly could have the story of a teen girl's exploration of her attractive power over boys which she finds as irresistibly stimulating as it is doubtfully and which has an even tighter grip on her than it would on a normal girl because it affects her through her this story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which movies are made an appeal of one kind to girls and of another kind to boys and i don't understand how the movie makers could be blind to that and turn the story into one with little appeal to anybody br br to begin with take the title which is the best thing about the book it's drawn from a quotation also used as an about a person running in fear and tasting both blood and chocolate in his mouth one tasting as bad as the other this is a wonderful metaphor for the heroine's state torn between her human and wolf sides savoring each but equally fearful of both the movie dispenses with the and instead introduces the character working in her aunt's chocolate shop i can understand how the book's title might have suggested to the movie makers the erotically charged chocolates of like water for chocolate and led them to want to link the same symbol to werewolves but they didn't so why is it in the movie in the book the characters are in high school or in and out as with the five a teen gang who favor black jeans and t shirts and fall somewhere between being the heroine's nemeses and her pet peeves in the movie they've become decadent twenty something in the book the heroine is 16 just of an age to be discovering how her sexuality operates on the boy she wants as well as on herself she's the one who initiates the contact then steps back re initiates and so on in the movie she's no longer a girl but a woman and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the fringe of campus life but a fugitive from the law and a comic book artist to boot it's he who comes on to her in a manner as unattractive as that of her wormy cousin she initially puts him off but then gives in as he's confident she will hey you know you want it i would have thought a female director would have taken the chance the book offered to show a female protagonist in an role but no br br in the book the heroine's clan is driven from their home because of the five's delinquent behavior in the movie it's because she went for a run she's a great runner prone to kicking off from building walls and both she and her scale buildings in a trice very like heroes of martial arts movies and very unlike wolves or anything resembling them in the book they don't turn into actual wolves but things bigger than wolves in the movie they're just ordinary wolves in the book they metamorphose in howling style with crunching of spines this is one of the things that make the heroine aware of the pain her body brings her as well as the pleasure in the movie the werewolves have become magical taking great swan dives and transforming in mid air shimmering yellow like tinker bell it looks cool means nothing br br in the book the clan is a slightly white trashy family that has relocated from west virginia to maryland in the movie they live in bucharest but all talk in different accents none romanian in the book nearly the whole pack want to lead normal lives and agree that to insure that and indeed their survival one necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans and so the characters keep saying in the movie yet the head of the clan is some kind of underground boss but apparently not a crime boss since he despises criminals and has a standing deal with the police who supply him with meat for the pack this seems a big exception to the rule of keeping humans from knowing but maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder br br at the end of the book the heroine learns she can't be something she's not when in her effort to live a divided life she gets stuck between the human and animal states unable to be all one thing or the other her boyfriend isn't sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is the pack can't risk having him around and the two are forced to separate in the movie she rescues him like lassie and they drive off to paris why paris in an ending that's smiley faced but not really happy since the conflicts between their natures between her natures remain unresolved br br but the difference in the movie that hampers enjoyment the most is that whereas the book characters behave conventionally within the realm of young adult novels those in the movie for some reason have been made as annoying as possible every other line is a threat or some other kind of you'll be sorry you don't belong here you won't get rid of me i gave you your chance etc i prefer to steer clear of people who deal in that way br br there have been many good vampire movies never a good werewolf movie had this one stuck to the book it might have been the first br br but no
<START> many people said this was a great movie with hoffman delivering a great performance i went from suspended disbelief to boredom to almost walking out there is no there there br br hoffman does go all out he is committed to the performance but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery br br no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than nell jack perry shawn the sheriff are all one dimensional br br yes the film shows the manipulative preening dishonest sides of capote it shows them so many times i started to wonder why do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out and again and again it refers often to capote's genius but does not show it it shows him surrounded by fans and but never convinces us why br br but my goal is not to deconstruct the film i am sure others will have other interpretations for me this was a two hour movie that felt like five
<START> samuel fuller knows war and is one of the only directors in american movie history who could accurately portray the horrific experiences of it in a form like the motion picture his pessimism and idealism if that sounds a little odd to mix together work for him as a storyteller and at the same time he's always out to tell the truth however brutal or put into melodramatic constructs it can get verboten however deals with the post war experience as we only get in the opening scenes the big boom of war in bold for a point the opening shot is like one big exclamation point that seems to continue on into the rest of the scenes a dead soldier on the ground the camera pans up we see another soldier shot down in war torn terrain simple direct language then fuller punctuates the intensity with something interesting the title song played over the opening credits as both irony and sincerity and then beethoven music over a shoot out between americans and the nazis sgt david brent james best is shot the battle goes on and then it transitions to him being treated for his wounds br br it might lead one to believe that this will be a somewhat conventional ww2 flick somewhat in that one usually wouldn't find beethoven and later on to an extent wagner put into these images but this isn't the case instead fuller makes this a 'coming home' kind of movie though not at all in the sense that 'this soldier comes home injured and so on and so on' instead of really going home brent stays on in germany as he's fallen head over heels for the woman helga susan cummings pretty good at pulling off the german accent and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the military so he can marry her what he doesn't realize is that a she wants him more for money so she can get food for herself and brother however this gets complex emotionally at the point of revelation to the slightly naive but heartfelt brent and b there's an underground hitler youth sect called the werewolves who want to pick right up off where hitler ended starting small despite argument within the group by attacking the very government that's now embedded in germany to give them as brent describes a blood transfusion with this plus footage from the nuremburg trials and as narrated i think by fuller himself a quick no punches pulled history of the nazi war crimes piece by piece we get a multi faceted look at a society in the dire straits of an immediate post war environment while rossellini handled it his own way with germany year zero fuller tackles it with layers first there's the love story or what is the tragic downfall of a man who can't see anything past what he thinks should be reasonable that it's his wife and a child on the way that he can't leave until the revelation that he's partly been swindled baker and cummings along with harold as young confused brother perform at with the utmost detail to emotions these aren't very easy b movie parts though they could've been that then another layer is the political one the struggle of a society to come to grips with being conquered and a mentality which is made sensationalized to be sure by fuller in respect to making the nazi's a total no gray area thing they're evil particularly when they cancel out reason to meet their ends br br and finally there's the layer of style which is strangely absorbing this is probably one of fuller's films which isn't a bad thing considering it's one of his best written scripts as the characters don't talk simply or in too many platitudes with the exception of a small scene where two characters talk about the hitler youth as juvenile delinquents which is actually according to fuller's autobiography probably another layer to consider in the subtext and the 50s period of movies and fuller shoots this almost in a real european style when he's not going for fight scenes or battles as the editing isn't always very fast and sometimes a cut won't happen for a full minute or longer there's an odd tension that grows out of this especially when there's something said by a character that gets another one wild eyed or suspicious fuller could easily go for a big close up but there's a more sinister cold quality to not moving away from two people in a conversation without a simple over the shoulder deal but when it requires it like the big brawl outside the american military office or the nuremburg footage spliced into franz's memories of the werewolves fuller can be as stunning stylist as ever br br very hard to find but extremely worth it if you'r either a fan of the director's or of ww2 movies set in germany or even just a history buff verboten is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional one with a cast that is better than expected from a b movie and an attitude towards the 'other' that is equally damning and thought provoking
<START> the a team is still repeating every day on dutch television around and i still watch it i don't like the a team i absolutely adore them it is just great to see justin chasing the former members of a team brings back memories from the old days when i was young an sweet i would have given you a 10 for excellent but justin looks like he is chasing the former a team members all by himself of course that is the only bad thing on this documentary too bad justin does not look for melinda amy a allen but it is great to see mr t back into action too bad for him he does not show up at the party at the end but that party is too short to laugh again and to see everybody in action again
<START> reba is without a doubt one of the worst comedy series ever i wonder how come there are people writing good comments on reba you watch friends married children if you laugh at that you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously having no chance whatsoever the actors actresses beside reba are ok so i feel bad for them in a so called comedy show with the least person in the world reba to sum up i suggest this tv show to see how low comedy can get and appreciate the ones that can make you laugh
<START> cameron mitchell plays an actor who is dating a young actress who used to date the head of a movie studio she's too young for both of them at a party when he's lighting his cigarette the studio boss throws a high alcohol content drink in his face and he catches fire in the hospital his face is entirely bandaged and he still lights up a cigarette he becomes the resident sculptor of the wax museum and palace where he also lights up cigarettes br br mitchell recovers more or less having really poorly done burn makeup on one side of his face that looks like gray and tape and an eyepatch when mitchell isn't smoking he's killing people well he only kills people sometimes since he prefers to inject them with something that puts them in a sort of coma if he doesn't administer it regularly and he never seems to remember they start to move again a little although they're in a sort of hypnotic zombie state not all his sculptures are people though he evidently does have talent as a sculptor br br the ending which seemed to have been struck from a much poorer print than the rest of the movie is really absurd they seemed not to know what to do and went back to the title for an idea apart from the oddly grainy final shots the rest of the movie is in fairly good shape except for the audio in some scenes which sounds like it was run through a blown speaker definitely not one of the better wax museum movies
<START> the acting is excellent in this film with some great actors it was fun to see fred as a young man this is not a comedy it's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful this is not a comedy it's a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful and some of them appear forced and contrived it's in the script though not the fault of the acting br br the 10 line requirement forces me to write some more hmmm loved carole lombard's my man godfrey because it is a comedy and while the acting is wonderful the story line and the script itself wins the day carole lombard is pretty and a wonderful actress i will try to watch fred features
<START> if i were to rate this movie based solely on the acting script production etc i would give it one star all these elements are awful i can partially forgive this in light of the film's 250 budget the movie does contain many entertaining scenes mostly those of the unintentionally funny variety some of these include a 14 year old kid stealing and driving a bus teenage hooligans one of whom is sporting a joy division t shirt getting scared away from harassing the film's protagonists by a woman brandishing an obviously fake firearm and an encounter with a plastic bull's skull in the arizona desert br br i would have given it 5 stars just for the entertainment value were it not for the presence of that horribly annoying morally pontificating old granny i had to dock one star just because of her who the bleep makes a wedding cake with black frosting anyhow
<START> a suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production features performances from no name actors that rival the top talent on the planet sadly none have a career br br also features the the god like ability of christopher nolan to write perfect dialogue dialogue is what carries this story which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books well shot very well edited even better written and amazingly well performed br br this movie has everything a great film needs except people who have seen it 9 10
<START> sad to say this is one of the sillier of john wayne's series of poverty row westerns for lone star productions here he is a united states marshal on the trail of a bandit known only i kid you not as the shadow br br no it's not lamont cranston it's some dude who gives his orders through an open wall safe so his men don't see who he is but the voice is unmistakable you'll know within 10 minutes of the film br br and another reviewer here is quite wrong no squeals or groans from the audience would have occurred because gabby hayes was still playing a variety of roles and he's clean shaven here he had not yet found his niche as the lovable oldtimer sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes like the duke br br later on he does lead his men quite openly in the climax so i'm not sure what the point of the original gimmick with the wall safe was i don't think those that wrote this one knew either br br wayne gets yakima canutt as an indian sidekick here and the relationship is just about the same as an unmasked lone ranger and tonto br br it's all pretty silly if you ask me
<START> i once lived in the u p and let me tell you what i didn't have the idea what the heck this bear walk is i never heard of it the whole 10 years i was up there it was really funny in the beginning but went down hill quickly
