<START> this movie was terrible how can somebody even think that this movie was like the ones back in the good old days when tim thomerson was not even in it and to make things worse they used clips from old trancer movies thats just terrible no trancer movie is complete without tim thomerson i love fullmoon films and i have been watching them since i was 4 years old i have been through everything they have done and this movie almost made me lose it now i got a couple of lines to fill so i will keep going their way of breeding new trancers is completely stupid as well as way to send jack back in time what happened to the chamber and finally what happened in the end of trancers 5 where lina says and i quote jack has given me something special and her and some other broad looks at her stomach i don't know maybe a baby is in there there were so many other places of going to but fullmoon the bed
<START> this film set the standard for african american film excellence when it was made i heard on various stories on the film through time that there was a push for an academy award nomination when it was released this film plays on various emotions and you definitely feel for all of the characters sure some of the acting is a little wooden but fortunately those parts aren't pivotal the music is sensational and if you don't think the ending is a tear jerker you have no heart in your chest if you watch cooley high you will see that many many films have copied various elements from it in order to strengthen their own films the biggest example of this is boyz n the hood
<START> many believe this movie is a baseball movie such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player but the movie isn't about baseball br br some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isn't really developed this movie is not a romantic comedy br br this movie is about culture an arrogant american major and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't indeed won't understand one another it's after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success the ballplayer becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american in allowing individual achievement and they meet in the middle br br baseball and the romance is subordinate to this critique of the two cultures many who have no understanding of the japanese mindset miss this and think it's a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy relief it's not the culture clash is the of the movie based on my own experience and understanding of the japanese culture i think this movie did quite well in that it didn't overly romanticize the japanese culture nor overdo it in its portrayal br br overall i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about
<START> i bought this movie for 99 cents at k mart several years back along with breed figuring anything with gabriel byrne and amanda is surely worth that much it wasn't dark obsession the title i bought it under was a slight cut above breed imbd rated at 2 4 but not enough to allow me to even keep it in the house i threw both movies in the trash br br this thing fails on so many levels it's hard to narrow it down but let's just say it's tawdry incredible boring hedonistic confusing and even at 100 minutes way too long br br i love byrne as an actor but this schlock really looks bad on his resume
<START> truly awful obviously an attempt to cash in on the star wars craze but there's no excuse for this insipid piece of garbage the storyline gets lost before the middle the characters are forgettable and the kid is such a non talent that all he does is pose for the camera an alien planet they land on is actually the naval in long beach california br br this movie actually made me physically ill watching it br br roger corman has made some good some bad movies in his career but there's no excuse for this one br br 0 10 imdb won't let you score a zero
<START> uncle frank is everyone's uncle this documentary covered all aspects of aging in america the lonliness the humor the irony uncle frank and aunt were supremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience the director did an unbelieveable job of capturing the small and large pieces that made up their lives thanks to everyone who helped in making this film
<START> of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone even ford but this is one of his worst even he seemed to know it probably from its jejune treatment not much above a bonanza or big valley br br yet there is one moment typical wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you the death of the indian wife of gable she has gone to give her baby some water and wham is killed by an arrow instantly no warning nada br br one of the most shocking unprepared for deaths in all cinema particularly after investing a whole hour of love for the lady in what looked to be a sappy western of course the treatment of her afterwards is laden with total indifference apparently to the film even so it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best
<START> this was a very good ppv but like wrestlemania xx some 14 years later the wwe crammed so many matches on it some of the matches were useless i'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do br br however major highlights included the huge pop for demolition winning the tag team belts from haku and andre the giant the first ever mixed tag match featuring randy savage and sensational queen sherri vs dusty rhodes and the late sapphire and the first ever clash between the ultimate warrior and hulk hogan br br some matches were a complete waste of time like the bolsheviks vs the hart foundation was only about 40 seconds long koko b ware vs rick martel was short and big bossman vs akeem was too short br br mr perfect vs brutus beefcake and ted dibiase vs jake 'the snake' roberts were very good indeed br br overall grade b
<START> this very low budget film is fun if you're a john fan but is otherwise disappointing at least it was short so i didn't feel like i had wasted too much of my time john's scenes are funny enough but the attempted 'deep' scenes with lacey chabert are pretty nauseating it starts off seeming like it could be a funny movie but some of the characters are just so outlandish while the others are far too serious that it just falls flat don't get me started on the ending it was totally implausible and didn't even fit with the rest of the movie i will say that i wasn't bored though which is why i rated it above a three fans of john will enjoy seeing him with a and stockings around his head and eating cheez its oh and make sure to check out john's deleted scenes they're better than some that were actually included in the movie
<START> a photographer in the small city of in south korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends we never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of hur jin ho's poignant first film christmas in august is not his illness it is the grace in which he conducts his life his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse sadly it was the final film shot by cinematographer yoo young kil before his death and the film is dedicated to his memory br br the photographer jung won is played by han suk at one time korea's most popular star a handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life jung won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father goo shin and sister oh ji teaching his dad how to play movies on the vcr and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die as jung won goes about the day to day business of getting his affairs in order dar im shim ha a meter reader comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic br br abrupt and impatient he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer without overt expression of romantic feelings their relationship develops a growing intimacy love is not something they say or do it is their ground of being the place where they come from to protect dar im from suffering jung won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop's window although jung decision to withhold his illness from dar im is open to question it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to live life to the fullest by playing around br br one of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself jung won makes sure the picture is an exact likeness knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance christmas in august is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point it is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments riding a bike sharing a joke eating ice cream being thoughtful and considerate and feeling good about what life has to offer it is a love story where love means having to say you're sorry although there have been many films on the dying process christmas in august propels the genre in a new direction and in the process offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition incongruously this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy
<START> i know that chill wills usually played lovable old sorts in westerns but his role in this segment is something i've remembered for a long time wills could be a first rate villain yes burgess meredith's fall was correct that look in eye it expressed porcine greed ignorance and the threat of violence all at once quite a performance i think br br the segment itself was a good one too question couldn't the little black bag cure alcoholism i guess it did sort of with fall but the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure if he had it as quickly as possible to br br there is one moment that was annoying but also necessary and it is something that appears to recur in these night gallery segments it's serling's constant need to for that's what we got one more time with dr fall i don't know what was more frustrating losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop fall from preaching about the benefit for humanity all while rubbing greedy face in the mud and therefore all but begging for to strike out at him but as i say it was necessary at least it was for me otherwise we wouldn't have been able to see performance discussed above all done without moving a muscle or speaking a word
<START> while i can't say whether or not larry hama ever saw any of the old cartoons i would think that writing said cartoons file cards and some of the comics would count for something br br for fans of the old cartoon this is pretty much a continuation of the same except with a few new characters and a more insane cobra commander br br we still have all the old favorites too but on a personal note one thing that always irritated me was this duke in charge stuff when there are tons of other officers around instead br br the battle sequences are similar to the old series as well the main trick here seems to be the cgi it's overall pretty good if not a little over the top
<START> step up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break the film is average in every way with little more for the viewer a jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special the acting was fine but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story none the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film there were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard this is a class b film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps the scenery was good and the characters held true to life it is worth the watch if you like that kind of film
<START> vampires i'm sorry but even for the 80's that's just way too cheesy to be remotely scary you can excuse the original the odd kitsch moment because it was parodying old movies and tv shows but that's been done once so the sequel needed to be a little less camp not even more outlandish plus the first movie had the presence of chris sarandon a man who could even make stalking in casual seem seductive that this one sorely lacks so there was no in anything that happened it just seemed silly br br admittedly i only saw this once when i was 7 but by then already being a huge fan of the original i remember being disgusted to me there is no sequel to fright night just a tacky spoof that doesn't deserve any appraisal whatsoever
<START> that's what i thought when i heard about the cast of inglorious basterds and i'm both from germany and into movies br br that guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre tv series and even there he didn't play the main parts obviously nobody ever noticed what he's capable of now thanks to qt he got one shot to change that and let's put it this way that was a bingo he is the living proof of what a great caster tarrantino is br br by the way i think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a german being able to understand everything and the german dialog is written almost as good as the english br br now i could repeat what many others have written here before i'll put it short finally qt is back
