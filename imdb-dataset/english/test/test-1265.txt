<START> i am writing this review simply because i am a huge fan of the book prozac nation and was appalled by the film br br i think that if you hadn't read the book you would have been lost watching the film as it provided no real back story to depression there was no real mention of her childhood her relationship with her father her experiences at summer camp her first therapists in fact the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until dr sterling that said if you had read the book you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place br br i found the book to be a vivid portrayal of depression highlighting low points and the experiences she had along the way the film however began at harvard and literally threw the audience straight in with no real explanation of what was going on br br events that in the book were important such as miscarriage her summer working in dallas her suicide attempt whilst on prozac were omitted from the film br br also this is pedantic but did not lose her virginity to noah the suicide attempt that was shown in sterling's office was completely different to the book for a start she actually overdosed on as opposed to the para suicidal gesture shown in the film br br all in all i would say that if you have read the book and enjoyed it identified with it then don't watch the film read now again' by the same author instead or watch girl interrupted br br the only redeeming feature was the performance by anne heche who i believe portrayed dr sterling very well christina ricci was also good though her performance seemed a little stilted jessica lange made for enjoyable viewing but looked the opposite of how mother is described in the book br br conclusion don't bother
<START> this soap is worse than bad it's poisonous of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on british society over the past twenty years eastenders is the prime example for two decades this show has celebrated the oaf the thug the wide boy the tart the the violent the sexually the criminal the ignorant the br br how many times has someone or other remarked that eastenders mirrors life life on which planet exactly br br it's written about working class characters as imagined by middle class people who have taken a course in creative writing eager to show to their middle class peers how familiar they are with the working class they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of eastenders br br this has a toxic effect on some minds less well equipped than others to handle fiction and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of br br thus it came to pass that eastenders mirrors life but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring eastenders br br other soaps have followed in footsteps filled to their stinking with ugly potato faced shaven headed pot bellied characters scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly this is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified meanwhile the burgeoning number of new tv induced drones will proceed inexorably toward cultural bankruptcy br br and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated of dancing in the corner of your living room it's your fault gentle reader that's what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison
<START> the director of this waste of celluloid specialises in dreadful exploitation films where pretension is all the previous year he did dangerously close whose good idea about gangs getting too much power in school and the school paper editor against them was submerged in a sea of sloppiness and he would go on to do cyborg jean claude van damme's worst film ever no mean feat this would be comedy about a girl kathy ireland in her film debut who's a total schlump whose inner babe is only awakened after she falls to the centre of the earth and has a set of badly filmed impossible to follow adventures chiefly involving a set of dwarves who want her because she has big bones go figure before returning home changed for the better isn't funny gripping or entertaining in the slightest and anybody watching this to salivate over miss ireland will be put off too not because of her voice but because she spends most of the film buried under tons of baggy clothes with huge glasses to boot no wonder cannon the producers are out of business amazingly kathy ireland has made better films since then or maybe that isn't so amazing next to this barb wire is aliens
<START> the first time i saw alice in wonderland Â an x rated musical comedy was in the early '80 in a movie theater in n y city with some friends i remember we actually enjoyed it very much although we were left wondering why all the goodies were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one leaving us guessing what we just missed obviously it was the soft core edited chopped version which left me with the desire to watch it again soon but in its original integral version well more then 20 years went by during which i forgot all about this movie and only a few days ago by sheer chance i stumbled upon a heavily used vhs copy which had seen better times a bit washed out colors scratchy sound and a few flaws but guess what it's the original uncut version and this time i really had a ball humor musical and porn may sound an awkward combination but in this case it really works and unlikely the big majority of boring porn flicks nowadays invading our screens this is a really amusing and entertaining sex fantasy which will not disappoint you the direction is clever the swift editing makes the movie fly like a bird all the familiar characters are lovable or just plain funny all the actors seem having a good time the songs are catchy worth mentioning the one about growing up sung by alice at the beginning of the movie and the hilarious what's a nice girl like you doing on a knight like this the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged amazingly energetic terry hall proves that she can also dance and dances enthusiastically her guts away don't worry she also does what she was best known for the acting the singing the set the costumes are of quality level and then there is kristine blue eyes debell in the first starring role of her career and oh boy she indeed has a few h c sequences personally i think they are absolutely not distasteful on the contrary they are spontaneous and quite arousing she is young and ohhh so very pretty with the help of her new friends in wonderland she discovers her body and her sexuality so she sings she dances and what do you expect she is also experimenting sex the closing sequence when she finally makes love to her boy friend is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie i think her physique du role the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile and her acting ability make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable there is plenty of sex going on in this wonderland and everybody seems eager to get busy with the first available boy s or girl s which means lot of hard core action to be seen on the other hand some close up shots clearly spliced in just to make the porn hounds really happy are a bit redundant for my personal taste in general however the sex action is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music the dances and the comedy if you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex watch it together take my word you will have an hour and a half of very good time perhaps also an after show extra action this is adult entertainment so be careful don't leave this video around or among other kid's videos if your 10 years old can put his hands on it he might amuse himself but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations about the reasons why this alice behaves quite differently from the one he red about in lewis carroll novel or he watched on the disney's video i bet you will not forget this one of a kind very soon it's a real shame that they don't like that anymore i give it a 9 out of 10
<START> if it wasn't for the very attractive jennifer in the lead role i would have turned milo off after the first 30 minutes however as easy on the eyes as she is she's not enough to save this film not by a long shot br br milo starts off with a group of young girls accompanying an assumed young boy in a yellow slicker to a house in the woods where he shows them embryos in jars apparently the deal was that if he showed them the jars ol' milo gets to conduct a exam on each in return one of the group volunteers to be milo's first patient and he leads her behind closed doors moments later blood flows from under the door and we are whisked into present day enter the lovely who plays one of the girls all grown up in present day a substitute teacher with shallow confidence whose closest friend appears to be a goldfish she receives an invitation to return home for a friend's wedding yep you guessed it return to milo who allegedly drowned years ago seems to be having a dilemma staying dead and begins terrorizing and murdering the girls he failed to examine all those years ago br br milo the character reminded me of one of the mutants from cronenberg's the brood he could have been scary but just how scary can a villain be who wears a yellow raincoat the plot confuses even itself and the conclusion left me wanting my 90 minutes back i'm sending milo an inept slasher film to stand in the corner
<START> the success of scream gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave i'm happy with that as a big fan of horror and i liked most of those new horror films is a one big pack of horror colorful fast paced and original i see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy much like episode 1 and aliens resurrection since it comes up with a new twist instead of focusing on the little boy killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples we have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll sized lovers very inventive
<START> though often considered peter sellers' worst film it is in fact an excellent send up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power often misunderstood the film is actually a departure from the type of film sellers was best known for satirical farce this film had excellent performances by jo ann pflug and pat morita of happy days and the karate kid movies but was marked by its irreverence and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day it was ahead of its time 1972 in taking the outrageous path that the monty python crew would take into the cinema some time later as such it was unacceptable to the traditional peter sellers fan who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed presently peter sellers movies are in demand by fans but this effort where does it hurt has by its nature become almost impossible to find
<START> this film is an insult to the play upon which it is based the character of claude has been warped beyond recognition leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot shame shame shame they have also cut a fair number of the original score of change the context in which the songs are sung this warps the air of the film and causes the viewer who is aware of how this should be to wince as the writer of this screen play gives hud a wife turns sheila into a spoiled rich girl characterizes claude as a cowboy and kills burger by sending him to vietnam instead if one is not familiar with the original plot i assure you this is not a bad film for you to see but if you ever wish to see the original or are as i am a die hard fan of the classic play you would do best to avoid the film altogether one really must stick to one or the other
<START> this movie have 4 parts and every is around 170 minutes long its based on true story of life of joe and it is telling all how he did see so in some events we can notice that we heard different about it movie make you tied up for chair till the end i think it is possible to watch all 4 in a row and not notice i watched 2 in a row and 2 next day in a row acting in movie is ok in some scenes awesome but in general could be but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor this one show real thing and story is key to this movie so the one who look for same spectacular rambo matrix titanic movie you can skip this one good thing in movie is that follow the main story so you will not have long and boring love scenes or any different interrupt with something not important to crime business of
<START> anything park chan wook creates is guaranteed to be unique brilliant and very twisted at a minimum well anything that isn't i'm a cyborg at least park's newest film titled thirst is a vampire romance erotic thriller dark comedy drama Â yes that is a lot of adjectives Â inspired by the 19th century french novel by emile zola titled therese park creates a uniquely korean and uniquely park vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like oldboy or even that of lady vengeance heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room it crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely as negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted zeitgeist of park chan wook film br br check out the rest of our review at www com
<START> this series when the dinosaurus lived for 65 million years ago the dinosaurus looks very real and are very realistic when they moves it is also very interesting how the climate changes br br i am very interesting in how the dinosaurs lived and died i am also interesting in how the dinosaurs behaved br br the color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discovered they think which color they had br br the most interesting is why the dinosaurs died and what happened after that br br bbc have made a brilliant series how the dinosaurs lived and died
<START> br br spoiler alert br br if you happen to like jurassic park 1 2 or 3 br br if you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality case in point john carpenter's dark star highly recommended br br if you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general br br then stay away from this cinematic crapsterpiece br br the shameless use of stock footage from carnosaur 1 2 make up most of this miserable attempt at a dino slasher flick take the scene for instance where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the alpha t rex for some reason he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger why is that simply because this scene was lifted directly from carnosaur which was a crummy flick to begin with br br the ending was a carbon copy of carnosaur 2 for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight to video loser again we see mr rex do battle against a bulldozer which alternates as a forklift truck through the miracle of ta stock footage from the aforementioned carnosaur 1 2 of course the ending is exactly the same the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames br br a real insult to anyone's intelligence br br but it's still better than watching the rosie o' show br br rating 1 2 out of br br
<START> i think it's incredibly hard to write any kind of full scale review to merely because it's one of those viewer dependent complex poetical and philosophical movies that are brain wearing if while watching them you're trying to enjoy their shell and get to their core simultaneously yet there are several things which are certain and beyond any doubt for any man of art which i hope i am the first thing it's a certain masterpiece even of that kind of art which remains through a long long time the second it's one of those rare dark movies in which darkness is poetic even romantic attractive and much more sad than depressing like the art of or caspar david friedrich as to the core of the movie someone called it though i don't agree with that because actually it's far beyond kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like edgar poe's parables dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of our souls actually on the poetic side which is much more important than the narrative is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved only through eternal childhood of soul those who have such souls are usually branded as crazy by our society but from another point of view they all have the virtue all the others lost when become grown the virtue of god's love indeed is a very christian movie be like children mt 18 3 is it's real hidden tag line though the movie never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates only on the christian philosophy for dare to suppose true god is beyond any human moral yet i think that is too harsh portraying grown people as a sort of demons trying to steal childhood from rare survived souls but it's his point of view and he has a right to think so while watching don't try to look for some hidden symbols though there are some better look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior and do learn from them also i cannot mention that the movie looks astonishingly through excellent photography especially through rational use of color filters incredibly apposite editing wonderful acting of all the cast and of course due to the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains that reminded me of the hunters in the snow also interestingly enough the scene with death in the form of an old woman with sunken black ringed eyes riding a cart instantly reminded me of plague from the series of drawings by the norwegian painter theodor depicting how a black plague is sweeping out the population of a small town in the mountain valley is it a coincidence
<START> if i look hard enough flaws can be found in this film primarily with the script i found the character of wolf not totally convincing however those were my only complaints because when this movie started on cable i was just going to record it and watch it later however from the beginning with the eerie music and cameron diaz doing her spaced out 60's dance i was riveted i never got up until the movie was over it seemed like i never even blinked br br the acting of cameron diaz and jordana brewster was excellent the scenes were beautiful the girls were beautiful and the music was haunting and very touching the story was quite unique and at times had a surreal quality the viewer would tend to like the picture more if they had a good understanding of the state of mind of young people in the 60's and 70's especially in america many of the scenes basically succeeded in showing something of that era that is hard to pin down it was a bit more complicated than the simplistic statement that they wanted to change the world and ended up disillusioned although that may be the most obvious aspect phoebe learns more and more about this as the movie progresses br br one aspect that didn't seem to be covered by the other reviewers that might bear mentioning is the way the two daughters seem to drift through life after the death of their father they both had adored him and his presence had been a factor in their lives and obviously he had loved them dearly we read so much today about boys who lose their fathers too soon only to lose their way themselves this film covers the ripple effect of the loss of the father on the daughters left behind first on the older sister faith then on to her younger sister their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents this type of dynamic is not covered in hardly any other movies especially in so many different layers of plot and subplot inner struggles of reality versus perceptions are gradually peeled away like layers of an onion br br speaking of plot this movie should rate higher than it has here i kept waiting for some great conspiracy to be found out concerning the death of faith how it did resolve itself surprised me even if others may have guessed much sooner br br maybe not for everybody but i could watch this movie many many times
<START> what a wonderful documentary i sat down thinking this would be a rehash of the bitchy stories told in easy riders raging bulls but it is in fact a clear eyed glorious celebration of a strange and twisted era that spawned some truly great movies what struck me was the lack of bitterness apparent in the director interviews given that now the movie business sucks in a large fashion instead folk like friedkin and coppola's eyes seem to positively glitter recalling their glory days the footage of an audience coming out of a daytime screening of the exorcist was priceless 'it was traumatic ' one guy says a great epitaph for the late ted demme a thrilling film i just wish it was longer i could have sat through a three hour cut of this
