<START> this show is my guilty pleasure all the way when i first tuned in to america's next top model i expected to be bored and to find it very very stupid i didn't this show is actually serious fun i read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be america's next top model and it so does who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model on you get to see what it's really like and who doesn't love hearing the girls bitch about each other and get into fights or enjoy wanting to throw something at that janice lady br br give this a chance don't expect something intelligent or a show you can look to for a life lesson just enjoy it for what it is serious fun
<START> dooley and his canine partner jerry lee are together again in this 2nd sequel i sincerely had no clue that they made one sequel let alone two and for a film that was only slight better than turner hooch this time after dooley retires he has to mate his dog with other dogs people and wait around for jerry lee to poo real classy stuff i mean come on now the original had at least a few good laugh this one has nary a one jim belushi just looks old and worn out both belushi brothers were great in the '80's if john hadn't died would he be so bad today like his brother that thought makes me sad for some reason br br my grade d br br where i saw it usa network
<START> as a fan of history mythology and fantasy mystic knights show pulled me in from the get go it has semi decent scripting the costumes are fantastic there are exceptions it has pretty good acting and the heroes and villains all play well off each other br br scripts half a script is pretty great the other half falls flat but its all mixed together meaning many episodes turn out so so also some of the key players are repeatedly being given dead lines king and angus for instance they need to be given something more i'm not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something acting apart from some over acting by villagers horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on everyone good and bad works well together costumes weapons the everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular mystic knight armor that falls short are and a bikini would probably have better protection in her case and wouldn't look as plastic his looks like bunch of snap it together pieces of brown plastic when it should look bronze trident looks like it was bought at a discount store and while weapons look cool they also look plastic br br recently mystic knights has taken on too many power rangers traits if you watch the show you'll know what i mean as the series progresses though it should find its niche and perfect its style overall it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy most of my friends and i watch it and we're all 20 the plot thickens and twists though it gets a bit juvenile in places and everything just keeps getting more interesting it might be of some interest to fans of the movie willow or the t v series the adventures of sinbad a lot of adventure a dab of mystery a dash of romance a sprinkling of forces at nature check it out my score 7 10
<START> after matt dillon's phenomenal performance in crash most will probably rush to pick up a copy of factotum to see if dillon is for real or simply got a lucky rebound from a great script br br well factotum certainly has its moments but the plainness of everything will most likely turn viewers off however nothing should be taken away from dillon his performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor proving he's a solid actor with significant chops it's just a shame about the directing and script br br the story is about henry hank dillon and his refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy he quits or gets fired from jobs in mere minutes only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even women while trying to write a novel we never really know what the novel is about except that it involves everything cancer movies you me br br skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to jan lili taylor the haunting a loser girlfriend who's just as dispiriting as himself hank tries vainly to discover what his life is supposed to hold for him whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation some may say that he never does while others might argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity br br regardless there's not much substance to factotum even with matt dillon's fine performance the story meanders through hank's life without much thought given as to where to take the audience and that's a shame dillon's performance would've shone even brighter if given a decent script
<START> a wasted effort on the surface it's a typical disaster movie we're involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the big event however the script is so awful and there's so much explaining of the characters' background within the dialogue that we feel we're being treated like morons even sesame street didn't explain the origins of mr snuffleupagus or how mr hooper died we can work it out someone thought that entering into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies the acting is by and large bland with the exception of the older performers randy quaid brian dennehy and after the first hour i couldn't care less about who the storms took out br br but maybe there are the special effects to watch sadly no even on a 20 year old tv set i could see one tractor and trailer were computer maybe there are budgetary limitations so i can forgive that one footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real but i kept telling myself i had seen that before this site confirms it it was from an earlier film nowhere to land br br so in summary the only good bits are from another film and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30 second network promo it makes category 6 look quite good my advice rely on your network to do some good 30 second clips watch them and save yourself two nights
<START> i loved this movie because bobbie phillips can really fight i always hate when actors are not believable in action parts it was great to see no offense but a woman who can skillfully perform martial arts and fighting if you compare this with most action movies with females you will definitely see what i mean they don't have to cut up the shots with someone that can fight and it flows better i was very impressed i hope there's more
<START> coconut fred's fruit salad island is a hilarious show that is on saturday mornings on wb it stars coconut fred and all of his friends on the island and every episode is a very funny misadventure of theirs most of the time it is because of coconut fred's trouble making antics which makes it funny and other stuff going on on the island at the same time the humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright at all which adds it being as amusing as it is i don't think this could be funnier the voice talents of the characters are magnificently superior and are exaggerated which adds to the show's hilarity if this is ever on dvd i'm getting it a s a p br br strongly recommended for a good laugh
<START> there have been some harsh criticisms of comanche moon on imdb i think this is for three reasons first purists are disappointed that the mini series is not exactly like the book second it's not as good as the original lonesome dove finally people like to complain on imdb and the greatest films in the world will have bad comments br br i would like to say that no movie is going to be as good as the book that's just the way it is lonesome dove wasn't as good as the novel it was based on additionally the movie of lonesome dove had some things left out ans switched around that's just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything so its a futile argument when looking at comanche moon br br i do agree it's not as good as the original dove but hey nothing is i know people that guide their lives by the lessons they learned from the dove if i was going to compare every book i read movie i watched and tv i viewed by lonesome dove i would be perpetually unhappy br br this is a made for tv miniseries based on a prequel to lonesome dave the novel and sequel to dead man's walk and that's what you get it's the best tv i've seen in years it's a fun set up for lonesome dove we get to learn about the history of the rangers we came to know and love in dove does an amazing job in recreating gus elizabeth banks and linda sp also do great jobs as creating characters that help fill in the past of the rangers and newt br br if when it comes on again i promise you'll enjoy it more than some crumby reality show
<START> blindingly stupid guff from the formerly talented john hughes who'll soon be making a film with the sperm from 'look who's talking' if his stars get any younger he recycles the 'home alone' formula yet again to produce this idiotic comedy in which a baby makes his way around chicago while inept kidnappers joe mantegna joe pantoliano and brian haley try to catch him along the way enduring much tiresome slapstick if mantegna and pantoliano can't find a laugh somewhere in your movie then you're in trouble but the laziness of the movie is most glaring in the scenes where crowds of people fail to notice a baby crawling around on the pavement utter nonsense
<START> due to the fact that in 1976 there were no cgi i felt that the movie was quite watchable the studio productions were very good and very elaborate the background effects were very believable and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set the actors did ok considering the premise of the film being set in a type of jules vern atmosphere where imagination and possibilities of future exploration were at most improbabilities had i watched this film in 1976 i probably would have been in awe of the ability of man to build a machine that could travel to the earths core i still wonder to this day why we are not all flying around in our cars but i digress mcclure and cushing have their funny moments mostly from their facial expressions toward each other which of course makes the film somewhat campy which i loved the 'monsters' left something to be desired but the story had a good premise although i feel as though some other sort of 'thing' could have been more believable under those circumstances all in all quite watchable for its time and fun now
<START> yes it's a so bad it's funny classic with a budget running into the tens of dollars some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen and absolutely no even remotely frightening moments not even a nanosecond camera work was at the elementary school level one still shot outside a house was obviously hand held and crazily blood looked like watered down cherry someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the human bones and miss witch had the cheapest mask wal mart could provide br br did anyone involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was most of the names in the credits have to be pseudonyms it would be career suicide to have this on your resume do yourself a favor and watch ebert's video of his instead
<START> in 1968 when take one was released it came from out of nowhere and struck like a psychedelic thunder bolt afro american actor and film maker william greaves aimed to forever alter the style of documentary film making and to this day there has never been anything quite like it the movie is a film about 'the making of a film' and intentionally written and directed so as to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible set in new york's central park the action and scant dialog concern a couple who fight and bicker about homosexuality and abortion the woman wants out of the relationship and the man wants an explanation near the end of this interaction a drunk homeless man interrupts the proceedings and offers his commentary and personal back story then after the principle footage has been shot the film crew add their own views of the film maker and what they feel is his inept handling of the movie and during the entire film multiple cameras are employed to record the action within the scene and extraneous commentary by cast crew and onlookers i would certainly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in avant garde film makers such as andy warhol john cassavetes or jim jarmusch william greaves attempts to show that a thing cannot be truly observed and understood because the viewing itself would alter the reality take one can be seen as a cinematic representation or application of the uncertainty principle this is only one possible explanation and true intent is certainly open for speculation above all else this film seeks to confound confront and stimulate and without a doubt succeeds admirably
<START> 1993 was a time of change in the wwe but for this wrestlemania they decided to wind back the clock as hulk hogan returned along with his good friend brutus beefcake who had been out of wrestling since a accident in 1990 br br this was not a great event only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being rushed the in ring action wasn't great and the twist at the end which i'll discuss later really wasn't the earth shattering moment the wwe hoped it would be br br this forgettable night started off with shawn micheals defending his intercontinental championship against the undefeated tatanka tatanka had beaten michaels a couple of times leading into the fight michaels had a new manager luna vachon while tatanka was accompanied by former manager and future wwe hall of sherri martel tatanka won by dq michaels kept his title and went straight back into his feud with marty janetty which had been put on hold just for wrestlemania why i have no idea br br next up saw the steiner brothers scott and rick defeat the headshrinkers samu and fatu with scott scoring the pin after hitting samu with the good match br br doink the clown needed help from another clown to win his match against crush a second doink distracting crush when he was in complete control and allowing doink to get the pin and the victory doink was an entertaining gimmick character who got old rather quickly br br razor ramon easily defeated the returning bob in the next match br br this brings us to the first in our double main event as the mega maniacs team of hulk hogan and brutus beefcake with the newly turned good guy jimmy hart in their corner took on hart's former buddies money inc ted dibiase and irwin r shyster this was a fairly sketchy finish beefcake as mentioned had been in a accident requiring full facial surgery and had wrestled the match with a face mask on shyster ripped the mask off him and beat beefcake to a pulp the ref went down hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out dibiase and shyster and then hart who was wearing a referee shirt counted the three another ref came down and reversed the decision declaring money inc winners by dq br br next up lex luger or the narcissist as he was also known at the time defeated mr perfect this match came about because luger was being managed by old manager bobby perfect had is feet on the ropes when he was pinned but the ref missed it br br the undertaker picked up a lacklustre dq victory in a pretty poor match against the giant gonzales the undertaker had earned the ire of manager harvey wippleman in 1992 and taker had defeated his big monster kamala at survivor series wippleman vowed revenge and took it at the royal rumble as gonzales attacked taker costing him the match gonzales dominated undertaker in this match but was for choking taker out with weird finish to a bad match br br this bought us to our main event as wwe champion bret hart seriously challenged as champion for the first time put his title on the line against mr unstoppable monster yokozuna yokozuna controlled the early going but hart resisted and then took control he had yokozuna in the sharpshooter surely he would give in and hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster but fuji had other ideas throwing salt in hart's face rendering the canadian helpless as yokozuna got the pin br br what a downer ending but wait here comes hulk hogan he's checking hart to make sure he's ok suddenly fuji challenges hogan to a wwe title right then and there hogan accepts fuji throws salt towards hogan but hits yokozuna instead hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title what did i just watch and so what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw hart establish himself as a giant killer or yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster we instead saw hulk hogan pick up a meaningless title win a title that he would not defend for three months as a matter of fact this was the only match hogan wrestled for the wwe before the king of the ring ppv in june 1993
<START> i saw a great clip of this film which i'll talk about later and then the cast list and thought i might as well give it a go basically a down on his luck bartender randy matt dillon his cocky cousin carl harding paul reiser and murder investigation detective john goodman all have something in common they have seen the girl of their dreams whether married or not and they would do anything to please and be with her even die all three met saw her one night at the bar that randy worked at they have no knowledge of each other but all three cannot stop thinking of femme jewel valentine the lord of the rings' liv tyler all three are telling their stories to someone they hope will listen to their pretty intense and revealing stories randy talks to hit man mr michael douglas who co produced the film carl to psychologist psychiatrist dr green reba mcentire and to priest father jimmy richard jenkins they confess all details of what they have been willing to do their sexual contact with her and eventually they are all brought together in one place all intent on being with her and all involved with the final shootout that leaves one dead one running away and eventually dying and one stunned and the unexpected guy she chooses but at the same time obvious cos it's sex obsessed douglas also starring andrew dice clay as utah elmo and sandy martin as bingo vendor woman if i had to pick a favourite moment it would definitely be what was mentioned at number 11 along with cool hand luke on the 100 greatest sexy moments where tyler copycats the woman washing the car with suds all over herself and in front of goodman very sexy apart from that not the most memorable film okay
<START> the best thing about this movie for me was that bryan dick played rafe and made me melt rafe and all his made the movie worth sitting through even though i to get up and scream i have never seen a hotter man br br ahem but that's not the point br br the title that is indeed what it is they took the beautiful story written by annette curtis klause and threw it out i will in all my anal retentive glory point out what was missing what has changed and all else wrong with the movie br br sit tight and here goes br br apparently rafe is son of astrid and gabriel and apparently is no longer child like in the book and as i recall from the book rafe and astrid were lovers br br astrid is apparently blond as opposed to the notably red hair described in the book i believe the book said that she looked more like a fox than a wolf and the movie also shows that astrid is aunt br br where did axel go br br vivian is 19 in the book she was 16 br br vivian and aiden meet in high school which they both attend in the book vivian goes to see aiden because of his poem 'wolf but according to the movie aiden beat up his dad escaped and now lives in romania and draws graphic novels this made me go 'what the f k ' br br there is no in the movie where was the kelly in the movie the kelly in the book however hated vivian and she also dated aiden after they broke up vivian even gets tipsy in the book and trashed her room br br gabriel bears a striking resemblance to a columbian drug lord in the movie and he sort of sounds like one too his acting was very good but his appearance threw me off br br vivian had no parents in the movie her father and mother and 2 other siblings died in the movie yet in the book when she comes home one night her mother is sitting on the couch after fighting with astrid over gabriel and vivian has no siblings only her father died in the book br br aiden accepts for what she is this really got me he kills rafe in the creepy church confronts vivian and she saves him from the others wolves except aiden shoots her so they off to find medicine and then they try to leave the city together wtf in the book aiden freaks out when she turns into a wolf and cries like a chick throws stuff at her and so she panics and jumps out the window then he makes up a story that he tried to break up with her and she threw a chair out of the window that doesn't sound accepting to me br br aiden wants her to runaway with him in the book he wants nothing to do with after she turns for him nor does he lovingly hold her face and say she can control it he cries like a woman because he is scared of her br br and the final indignation the one that nearly gave my three best friends and i heart attacks in our seats br br in the movie aiden and vivian run away together and has killed gabriel as in she shoots him gabriel dies in the book not only does vivian not kill gabriel i do believe they end up together as in she doesn't end up with aiden she ends up with gabriel what the hell br br small things were noticed too red hair which he gets from astrid has been changed to brown in the movie and vivian works at a chocolate shop br br a horrible shock i am ashamed the book really wasn't hard to follow if disney can use a random h school why couldn't the directer have found a random h school br br sigh i was really looking forward to this movie i loved the book it's sad that it didn't follow it one bit i give it a 2 only because as the top of this review states rafe played by bryan dick was dead sexy and agnes bruckner did a wonderful job and they kept the poem from br br with love br br caitlin
