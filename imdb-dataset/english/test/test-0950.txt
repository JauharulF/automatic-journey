<START> what can be said of this independent effort beyond the fact that it was shot with television cameras and whether that was by conceit or budget constraints doesn't make the watching of this variation on a theme by romero any easier i was constantly reminded that i was watching somebody's school project at best derivative at worst cheap br br writer director georg who also appears in the film does some interesting things with stock footage but that says more about his editing style than his directing style which consists of in your face close ups with tv cameras which made me think i was watching public access television instead of an actual honest to goodness film br br the story copies and bits and pieces from various sources including the aforementioned romero's dead trilogy the road warrior dig that stock footage of a future that looks like the past and the blair witch project br br what results is an hour and nothing's worth of zombies tracking down and eating humans okay the humans in this case are clones but that doesn't change anything it's the same menu br br the year is 2031 and the first strand of people who were cloned nineteen years before have started to malfunction particularly in the area of course when clones go bad the first thing they have a taste for is human flesh or in this case cloned human flesh it's not safe to be indoors it's not safe to be outdoors it's just a matter of time before the flesh eating ghouls devour our heroes have you seen this before br br i don't mind people ripping off romero if it's done well but no new territory is covered in this film it's night of the living dead meets the blair witch project shot with television cameras what is particularly disappointing is that the dvd cover makes it look like it was shot at the very least with 8mm film this wouldn't have been a problem with me if the story had not been equally cheap the film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible must we continue to clone our favourite movies
<START> ok now at first i thought this was going to be another cheesy romantic comedy which held back on the comedy but this wasn't i mean how could it have been with the fabulous amanda bynes staring in it she was amazing really funny is still stunning the boys in it were also extremely fit one major reason for going girls the plot is strongly based upon the shakespeare play night' as it was extremely similar there was even a spider called which belonged to the like character the script was really well written and pulled together and it was very witty the football skills in it were also amazing it even made me think of playing football myself anyway to sum it up this is a light hearted film about young romance which gets very confusing go and see it
<START> the auteur of prince manages to take an excellent cast a decent story a mediocre script and carefully assemble them into one boring monotonous amateurish mess in spite of a strong central performance by frank the prince this disjointed film wanders aimlessly from scene to scene painfully disintegrating into hash the result brings a sigh of relief at the end where the tears of joy should be a sad waste of time and talent and a good example of how not to direct a film br br
<START> i'm just throwing in this review to show that i'm not crazy i like a lot of work deathstalker 2 chopping mall against the law are fast paced and highly enjoyable just to prove i'm not blind i have to mention this along with some shannon tweed body chemistry 3 or 4 or something are the lousy ones i've got nothing against drawn out sex sequences but julie strain's breasts are so unnatural looking you can't help but stare at them which may be the desired effect but i didn't enjoy staring at them and several members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested the erotic thriller was the worst thing to happen to low budget flicks ever and thank god that their day has more or less done
<START> this cheapo exploitation flick is some genuinely insipid stuff courtesy of spaghetti land director lamberto bava who wisely left his name off this junk br br the basic crux of this outing concerns the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals being washed up on shore in the caribbean authorities initially believe them to be victims of shark attacks but as the investigation unravels turns out to be something much more sinister br br all of this ultimately amounts to very little however we have here poor dubbing complimented by similarly weak script which often consists of nonsensical jabbering and is really of little consequence for the most part acting can only be described as sub par which is par for the course in this instance truly lax direction doesn't help things either br br special effect mainly is for numerous close ups of various gory bodies missing limbs and so forth of course there is the obligatory creature which periodically emerges at feeding time which looks something like a big monster octopus thing where its animation only consists of its pointed teeth ascending and descending in rhythmic articulation overall the end result is none too convincing sure but admittedly is almost entertaining in a cheesy kind of fashion br br it seems what the film makers were going for was a sort of low rent hybrid of jaws and piranha but the final product is just a bloody shambles much like the corpses incessantly shown throughout this picture i find it difficult to think of any redeeming attributes to warrant viewing this so moreover strictly for incurable monster movie addicts
<START> it's incredible how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being abominable for those of you who appreciate painstaking special effects and inconceivable detail in every shot you will watch this film in awe simply because predator island contains none of this it is a redundant remake of every horror monster movie in the last two decades now i appreciate bad horror films they have a certain flare for humor in the most dramatic of circumstances however if your goal is to create a memorable work that will thus be engulfed in the cult hall of fame then my first suggestion is to find some imagination creativity plus get some talent oh and a few extra bucks to put into your picture br br one horror film tradition has been to shock the audience with violent deaths and gore however shock doesn't deliver for more than a few seconds to really evoke a satisfying reaction from paying crowd there should b development of characters some identifiable traits i know you're probably saying this guy is not providing anything intelligent to the filmmakers he's just stating an amateur remark well that goes to show you how amateur these filmmakers are br br despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie there was a silver lining the performance by dan gordon as chris is splendid he is given nothing to work with in a script and yet he is able to come out of that film looking like a star out of all of the actors he is the only who believes in what he is reciting he not only provides the audience with someone we can identify with but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can get through the rest of the film gordon shows genuine talent and the ability to pull off quality work and overcoming a huge obstacle that being the rest of the cast dan gordon is going to be a star hopefully sooner than later that is to say if he can get away films like this that will hold him back
<START> any of law csi take your choice of city and homicide life on the street's weakest episodes is superior to the strongest episode of bones br br david boreanaz is stuck in crappy angel mode and emily deschanel portrays bones too unrealistically the actors as a whole have terrible scenes together be it with forced acting or just awful lines br br the murders become predictable after a while as the foreshadowing and clues are just too obvious br br music is okay though really unnecessary at times br br all in all bones is hardly the show i'd recommend watching during the weekdays as it is a carbon copy of better shows with unreal characters and ever dulling stories br br skip this if you can
<START> the person who wrote the summary and rave review for this film is either an idiot or an avid fan of shitty movies from the beginning this just spoke of cheap ass ripoff of the descent a far superior film that definitely does not start off slow br br from the very first moments of the cavern i was amazed at how bad it was how uninspired and unoriginal it was how badly written badly acted and badly directed it was this is without a doubt one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life and that's saying a lot considering i recently suffered through pulse i can't believe this piece of garbage actually won awards which just goes to show the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in australia and other countries than in the u s br br the scenes where the group is running from the creature are badly directed especially the retarded upside down camera intended to show disorientation but only coming off as a cheap effect which a first year film student would be suitably berated for by their teacher br br sadly this director will probably go on to make other movies more than likely of the same low quality as this film since i'm sure he hasn't learned from his mistakes which on this picture were excessive br br if i had my way the entire cast and crew would be sent up the river for life without parole this film is a crime against humanity
<START> subtle delicate touching br br a young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy history of a coming out and anatomy of relationship br br soft ambiguous gestures slices of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expression br br two men a girl a afternoon on beach some words and a gift religious traces and a vision of light and expression nooks of an ordinary day and hot evening br br a erotic chaste film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only instruments for good definition of a universe with values br br pledge for self discover universe of beauty exploration the sign of ozon and same nostalgic air of every creation robe is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream to look with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people
<START> spoilers this movie has it's problems but in the end it gets the message across i liked it because it ends the way things really do the nice guy tries and tries gets his heart broken several times but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending it ends the way such things always end or at least always have in my own and friends' experiences anyone who thinks that the ending to this isn't how it really happens as the first comment seemed to believing that the girl would come around realize she's dating an asshole who treats her bad because he doesn't care about her at all is either naive or lives in a more perfect world than i i give it 7 10 extra points simply because it wasn't afraid to end on a down note give no real resolution just the main character left heartbroken confused and alone as so many men of countless generations have been before
<START> there are a number of movies that my high school friends and i used to joke about they are mostly the campy works of the 50's that showed up on television on the late show this was one of our favorites the soul of a fallen native being brought to life in a tree stump with a scowl on its face now my friends claimed that if you looked carefully you could see the thing had shoes i never saw this what is most striking to me is that the natives seemed to be white men with black grease paint on their faces some looked sort of italian they also spoke with the strangest timbre that didn't seem to fit their situation like the mummy movies the mobility of the thing didn't seem to offer much of a threat in a confrontation one should only have to walk fast i guess it's the old element of surprise if you see this don't take it too seriously be happy that we have a battery of old horror movies that gave us such joy
<START> why is it that every time i mention this movie to somebody i have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it i have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed genius by anyone who watches it is that really what film has become or is it that any time someone says wow that is so cool everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own how this movie has a 7 5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general it has also become yet another movie that needs two sequels for it so i am going to have to hear about this horrible franchise for quite a while longer br br now to the film and why it is so bad the original concept of it is actually not that bad as there has not been a good serial killer movie in a while the writing for this film is horrible as well as the execution ok so its a low budget movie but that should not change the story or writing the actors could not be worse in their attempt to make us scared of this killer or just scared of this movie so they go out and get a big name in danny glover but his talents whatever those are are wasted because his character is worthless why was he even in this movie what was his whole fight at the end turned out to be useless and misleading for what the audience believes is happening this is of course the filmmakers intent but couldn't there have been a better way to do this without making us watch all that garbage and then the big twist comes was this the third or fourth and the whole audience is shocked and walks out of the theater like this is some kind of masterpiece sure the movie gets people talking about the storyline and what not but that was not the only flaw in this film the direction was trying to be way too creative with what it was working with and the flashback sequences were used merely as a shock effect br br after watching this movie even if you enjoyed it go back and review the film and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of the praise it is receiving for an amazing serial killer film check out se7en if you have not done so that is what this film wanted to be i have gotten into more arguments about this film than probably any others and will continue to argue against it please do not support this franchise for not only your sake but mine and everybody else's sake as well hollywood needs to find a good horror movie to make rather than 1 000 remakes sequels and shock factor films such as this oh yeah the saw 2 tag line sounds real promising oh yes there will be blood sweet blood that must mean its good right give me a break sorry everybody who love this movie but poor writing flashy direction and bad acting does not make a good movie
<START> there is no need for me to repeat the synopsis rendered by glenn the black and white rendition is even more powerful in portraying the bleakness of country village life at that time the deep measure of friendship shown by babette toward the two elderly sisters touches the heart strings the supporting cast is excellent and their performances superb it would not be fair to single out any one character since the entire story depends on the cast as a whole i cannot put my finger exactly on why i rate this movie so highly since i am not a professional critic individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating since enjoyment of this type of movie is always in the eye of the beholder
<START> well where do i start br br as one of the other reviewers said you know you're in for a real treat when you see the opening shot minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a br br i won't repeat rubin's excellent summary of the story what i would like to say though is that this film gripped me more than any film i can remember i sat open mouthed and on the edge of my seat all the way through the camera work sound track and fantastic performances particularly that of tony draw you to the screen and won't let you look away br br it's italian so of course everyone looks fantastic but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style this is a film with lots to say about luck loss and love br br go and see it
<START> this is a piece of celluloid crap you can tell when you are watching a wanna be mafia film and this is it this made no sense at all didnt start at the beginning of his life were all over the place and the term godfather didnt even exist until puzo wrote the book then the real mafia borrowed the phrase and made it their own after the movie this piece of claptrap would have one thinking that the phrase representing the mafia don was used back in the 20's when these people were only called don outside of the original godfather movie if you want to see another decent mob flick check out puzo's the last don part 1 part 2 sucked
