<START> this is one of the worst movies ever made i can't believe how bad it was i was shocked at the awfulness of the ghoulies masks they are obviously halloween masks the mouths don't even move when they talk why did they feel the need to make the ghoulies comical and goofy whenever they do anything there seems to be this circus like music and overused bonk and noises when they hit people the bondage dominatrix lady is one of the worst actresses i have ever seen this movie is just bad the plot is nonexistent the mom from one tree hill is in this though and she has obviously had a nose job since this was made why did the main character from the first movie return to make this garbage bad bad bad movie
<START> what does this movie have lots of gunfire and expensive effects nothing makes sense on any other level br br watching arnold cry is seeing acting so bad that it is laughable the plot is ludicrous br br if you think the devil will be impressed by a bad actor with a machine gun well this movie is for you
<START> i am a massive hitchcock fan ever since seeing rear window on television saboteur is not hitchcock's best for me though it is very good but not a masterpiece it does have its faults some parts are rather slow moving and as a consequence of it being written off in a hurry the script felt rather incomplete but hitchcock's direction is superb and the performances weren't that bad while robert cummings and priscilla lane both do a good enough job otto kruger and norman lloyd come very close to stealing the show the story is good about a wronged man on the run very similar themes used in 39 steps and north by northwest and cleverly provides some much needed escapism the music score was absolutely outstanding the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal almost like a distorted march and i liked the digs at tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto and beethoven's 5th symphony the cinematography is also crisp and smooth the scenery and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes namely the statue of liberty climax but the circus troupe encounter and the radio music city hall shoot out is also on the money overall not hitchcock's best but definitely worth the look 8 10 bethany cox
<START> okay it's too long and it's too satisfied with itself still the great dictator is a fascinating movie chaplin does a terrific job satirizing hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the jews in nazi germany this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge not a chaplin masterpiece but still worth seeing br br
<START> this film is little more than an ersatz verhoeven the filming is supposed to be tele realistic but is simply sickening the parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously the brechtian pauses for non existent advert brakes are tedious and even painful undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film brechtian it was just an accident which happened like that if you want to see a parody of reality tv watch celebrity deathmatch it's funnier and wittier and most importantly shorter i have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film to be avoided like a rabid rabbit
<START> i usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as i do watching the film but with today you die i feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time br br so here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is br br there was a time in the mid 80s when a single look from steven seagal was enough to crack your ribs a full on scowl could knock you off your feet if he actually got a hold of you he would snap you like a twig br br these days although he is still capable of doing considerable damage he no longer looks the part he's gone to seed and just doesn't know when to call it quits he walks like he's dumped in his pants yet somehow still manages to look constipated and he has put on weight his trademark long ponytail has gone but his hair still looks stupid how this man keeps on working in the movie industry is beyond me br br today you die is the usual seagal mix of bone crunching fights car crashes gun battles and pyrotechnics seagal mumbles his way through the dull script delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or believability in this third rate action flick he plays harlan banks a thief trying to go straight who is conned into partaking in a 20 000 000 robbery he gets caught goes to jail escapes and seeks revenge yawn br br there are some pretty good car chases and gun fights which intersperse the boring stuff of which there is a lot but reading other comments on imdb has revealed that these were actually borrowed from other better movies seagal is also body doubled an awful lot in this one br br seagal turns in one of the most dreadful performances of his that's saying something considering the lousy 'acting' in some of his recent efforts most hilarious is his totally embarrassing attempt at ebonics african american street slang 'i da man actually steven you sound like an arse with a ridiculous script and plot lines that go nowhere this film is a waste of time money and effort and the final moment where harlan banks saves a children's home from closure is enough to make you blow chunks br br damn i just looked at the clock i was enjoying trashing this steaming pile of dreck so much i went way over my five minutes it's time to post this comment and get to watching something decent
<START> recap based on the true story of charlie wilson an american congressman who according to this movie was instrumental in usa's covert war in afghanistan against the soviet union br br comments a rather funny movie about not so funny things especially since they were real but focusing on the movie hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing congressman with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in afghanistan hanks and the entire movie philip hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone so much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell and maybe the ending the most are serious indeed br br a story of what happened with some questions about what might have been so the movie works as a comedy if you want one and a much more serious one if you want that something for everybody 7 10
<START> one would think that since this film has a bad rep that i would be exaggerating when i say i hated this film but i'm am serious this movie was just so stupid and so unfunny and such a waste of time i mean after the first 30 i had a major headache and the smile i had on my face that was mostly getting ready to laugh was wearing off when this film was over i was so glad and because i had good expectations that it would be funny i was extremely disappointed the acting is not great the comedy moments are lame and unfunny hardly anything is good about this because i laughed at like maybe 2 parts overall this is so boring and i can't tell you how awful this is i think this could be used as a suicide technique i mean i don't think for some its even watchable so my final words on this are avoid at all costs
<START> this is one worth watching although it is sometimes cheesy it is great to see a young sean astin and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous action movie i watched it many times when i was young and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine i happen to own a copy so sit back with this movie let reality go for a little while and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half
<START> if you've ever been to ukraine this movie is absolutely hilarious from teenagers wearing gold chains listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air bags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian this movie really captures bits and pieces of ukraine that you would never know unless you went there i spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking yep that's exactly right it's a lot of fun if you understand russian too because the subtitles just don't always do it justice the actors are so believable and elijah wood does a great job playing a socially inept jewish kid my favorite character is definitely sammy davis jr jr the grandfather's seeing eye dog who is really a psychopathic border collie the characters are so eclectic and likable that you believe that they are real people
<START> gilles is playing with the audience with the story of max vincent cassel in search of his biggest lost love monica bellucci just before to get engaged to another woman uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor's haircut it can get very confusing still a strong film debut for beautifully photographed by thierry the 5th element the messenger and monica bellucci is a darling to watch i felt a little disappointed near the end so i gave it 9 out of 10
<START> this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad i really lost it with those out of the blue not so special effect guys if you're an insomniac go with your girl to see this movie i give it three
<START> this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies in the history of cinema the screenplay is really well done which is not often the case for this type of movies and you can see that chuck in one of his first role is a great actor the final fight with the sherif deputy in the is a masterpiece
<START> i'm rating this pretty high just because of sam elliott i could've done without the female nudity but i'd sit through almost any nonsense in order to see sam strut his stuff he gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms many of which i agree with and it's a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be my boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which ed harris had a hispanic partner in the police sense of the term who was a little to prove himself you can draw your own conclusions on that score but if you like sam you'll like this you could say i'm biased but who isn't in some way i'd buy this on dvd in a heartbeat
<START> the only entertaining thing that i found about watching this movie was listening to star wars coming through the wall of the movie theatre yes i go to a really bad movie theatre this movie is so mind numbingly bad that i think i would rather have my eyes scratched out by a cat rather than watch it again br br let's compare it to the original one is charming funny exciting well acted and one of the best movies ever made the other is so far from funny that all you can do is hope that your eyeballs will fall out so you don't have to watch any more i'm sorry christina ricci is a fine actress but cannot compare with mills and don't even get me started on doug e doug in a part one occupied by the amazing and absolutely charming dean jones dean jones' tiny part in the new version is the only partially redeeming part of this movie and it is the only reason i can justify a 1 rating also because the imdb doesn't go into negatives
