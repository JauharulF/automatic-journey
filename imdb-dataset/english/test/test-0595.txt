<START> this is by far my favorite action movie but what makes it work is not the elaborate renny harlin explosions and shoot em ups it's the shane black script and its deft delivery by geena davis and samuel l jackson br br the chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel thank god it was never made too much danger of marring the original br br 'the long from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again never a dull moment br br this has to be jackson's funniest role ever and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career no quirky tarantino hit man super cool shaft or borderline psycho soldier in jackson is the everyman we identify with the poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman's odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past br br though the story claims that davis's character samantha caine is suffering from amnesia the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder br br samantha caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac charly baltimore she is a separate fully developed personality the traumas suffered by samantha in the first half hour of the movie help the submerged dissociate personality of charly to emerge again br br the materials of her past life excavated by jackson's detective mitch facilitate charly's resurfacing good timing too considering the target samantha makes of herself br br but charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality one gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality charly developed after her father died and she was recruited by the chapter br br in the eight years charly was buried in the psyche though her samantha identity developed into the dominant personality she's even funnier that charly this was probably due to becoming a mother because it's the reunion with her daughter that breaks charly's struggle to suppress samantha leading to their apparent integration by movie's end br br it's impossible to choose a best quote from this film br br now you're a sharpshooter br br i saved your ass it was great br br continue dying out br br i sock 'em in the jaw and yell goes the br br and a couple of dozen more many too raunchy to quote here br br geena davis looks great and comes off as an action hero without glossing over the fact she's turning forty listen to history do the math br br fantastic soundtrack too santana muddy waters elvis marvin gaye br br i give 'the long kiss a 9 only because i don't believe in a perfect 10 seen it a dozen times and it still stays fresh nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to 'it's a wonderful life '
<START> boring as hell and kind of a chick flick br br it's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement the romantic nature of a one night stand and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love br br many of the story's motifs are reminiscent of other recent movies e g the english patient but have far less appeal br br after the first half hour i started checking my watch wondering if i'd make it home in time to catch leno on tv br br i passed up gladiator to see this
<START> this is one of the best of the early star trek episodes with kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded romulans are racial offshoots of the vulcans young mr stiles well played by paul is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the star trek universe his barely disguised hatred of mr spock is eerily similar to the post 9 11 hatred and suspicion many americans have of people of arab or middle eastern origin the atmosphere of war time paranoia is all too real then there's the romulans they're the ultimate federation nemesis the klingons are nasty but basically harmless more of a nuisance than a serious threat the romulans however mean business they're the ancient romans reborn in the space age in spite of their features they're clearly meant to remind us of imperial rome with names like and titles like and the chain mail armor is really cool familiar guest star mark who went on to play spock's dad as well as the klingon commander in star trek the motion picture is an appropriately grizzled war weary commander a character who bears a striking resemblance to laurence olivier's in spartacus also his questioning of the empire's unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar misgivings marcus aurelius richard harris expressed at the beginning of gladiator a must both for trekkies and sword and sandal epic fans
<START> i remember seeing this film in the mid 80's thought it a well paced and well acted piece i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed although my office is it just 30 seconds away from the bank even jack car dealership is still there selling and rolls br br it's look like the dvd is due a region 2 release soon the region 1 copy i is very poor quality let's hope they've cleaned it up br br only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with
<START> went to the preview engagement of grand champion today dallas fort worth austin snyder and a couple of other texas cities there are so few movies suitable for young children but this one is and it's great though the plot is a little hokey also the name of the steer in the movie it is a wonderful story for children and i enjoyed it too br br the film pretty well represents west texas ranch family life although a little exaggerated director author barry ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment he called the film his love letter to texas br br joey lauren adams plays the single mom of buddy jacob fisher and sister emma roberts watch emma roberts julia roberts' niece she's very good and i think she will be in more films there are also cameo appearances from julia roberts bruce willis musicians george strait charlie robert earl keen joe ely and rodeo legends larry and tuff br br if you have young children or just want to see a feel good movie check out grand champion when it comes to your city supposedly later this month y'all will enjoy it and it will make you feel good br br i guess since i'm from west texas i might be a little biased nah i'm impartial the film is excellent
<START> i watched this series on tv in 1990 and absolutely loved it i was nine years old i bought the first dvd box about six month ago and got the second a couple of days ago thanks to my dear husband gosh it was hard to get any sleep with all the thoughts in my head what was gonna happen to madeline and george etc slave issues and civil war has always fascinated me a 25 year old finn i advise to read slaves in the family by edward ball for those who want to take a peek in the past and try to understand what really happened br br i'm not sure if i want to see heaven and hell after so many people have told here that it wasn't really that good
<START> the other reviewer was completely correct about this one the writing was awful the acting was awful the subject was awful the actors looked like they were not really into the movie like they almost had to be there there were some unique camera effects but they were not really germane to the story or what there was of a story and they weren't produced particularly well br br i suppose they were trying to on the success can i say that of the other influenced movies omega code left behind and yes it does make christians embarrassed when these types of movies are produced i would not recommend this movie to anyone especially a non christian
<START> a couple of men are ship wrecked on a remote island they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife br br the dungeon of harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie the amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way in fact the film in general is completely lethargic it just seems to drag on and on and even though the ending isn't too bad you will be hard pressed to care by that point as an example of 60's gothic horror this is strictly a bargain basement example i sadly can't recommend this one really
<START> the funniest performance was by shalom harlow as matt dillon's supermodel girlfriend she was more interesting to me than all the lead actors this movie got it all wrong even the most dependable actress of the century joan was not able to rise about the ridiculousness of the plot i did enjoy hearing macho man by the village people over the closing credits the rest of the movie might have been tolerable if it were to rise to that level of energy
<START> slow moving but smart passes you by as if you lived it filled with thought provoking ideas art race and being cool that one thing hit me hard was the ideas about the rock n' roll lifestyles br br all the performances were improvised i will say it again all the performances were improvised sounds like a gimmick but its not it makes these characters real and like some one you would hang with this also an amazing thing when you think about how strong the character are in this film right from the beginning in the title sequence it immediately establish ben as an outcast by the way he moves though the crowd br br okay it breaks down like this if your a person who lives the jazz rocker lifestyle of cool you will like it if your smart and understand great cinema from total crap you will love it and if your both then it might be you fav br br but if your none of these then you will probably think its boring and say it doesn't follow one line and write a crap review like ben cheshire
<START> it's true that they died with their boots on gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custer's errol flynn life and career but a remarkable one especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the us american cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse anthony quinn in a favorable light i'm almost tempted to say that little big man in its unqualified anti custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison further one should not be mislead by the title of the picture Â this isn't just a movie about the battle of the little big horn it's a movie about that shows the unreliable west point cadet the famed civil war hero the indian fighter and last but not least the husband br br the movie begins with custer's time at the west point military academy where his and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent during a military exercise he meets his future wife elizabeth bacon olivia de havilland who like custer himself is a native of monroe michigan custer intends to court her but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away custer's legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general jeb stuart during the battle of gettysburg while on leave he travels to monroe and courts elizabeth who promises him her hand in matrimony immediately after the war custer and elizabeth bacon are married br br with the civil war over custer is doesn't get a real command and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small professional american army as he starts to drink his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general in chief winfield scott custer is given the command of the us 7th cavalry which he trains to be an elite unit neither custer nor crazy horse are desirous of battle but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of crazy horse's cause but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle br br they died with their boots on though short on historical accuracy is as good as war movies and westerns in the 1940s got both custer and crazy horse are played by major actors neither the indians nor the southern confederacy are denigrated and the courtship scenes with beautiful de havilland are just charming the only minus and that's why i can't give this picture a full 10 is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of african american servants elizabeth's servant is the stereotypical overweight good natured superstitious black mammy br br it is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either custer or crazy horse but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring washington politicians with semi criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the native americans just a couple of years later the insinuation that american could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers br br needless to say that they died with their boots on omits the fact that custer's overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with stuart and doesn't mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the battle of the little big horn nevertheless custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the battles of brandy station gettysburg station and others though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the civil war as they died with their boots on suggests br br in any event they died with their boots on is a well made war movie with western elements three outstanding performers flynn quinn and de havilland and offers a positive view of native americans as well as a negative one on big money which wouldn't be seen in major hollywood productions for decades to come it would deserve a 10 if it weren't for the racist of african americans
<START> ok this will contain spoilers now i have never seen such a large pile of poop since the laxative feed mix up at the elephant enclosure in the zoo it has more plot holes than moth eaten lace and as for the 'realistic' plot line well sexual slavery is a dreadful and very real world wide problem and this pile of bilge utilises this plague as a plot device to titillate and tease shame on everyone involved for that piece of questionable judgement but back to the film if you were going to kidnap people from an airport some of the most secure and camera happy places in the modern world by the way then why plant a stoolie on the inside of the van who does bugger all until the plot needs a twist just wait until you are out of the airport pull the gun handcuff the passengers drive calmly to the warehouse and kill the guys job done on the passengers side on at least three occasions the good guys have the bad guys incapacitated and are armed waste them once in a movie it can just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the bad guys skull but come on three times and after he's killed most of you also the guy is willing to put down the gun to stop a scarred cheek but kills a girl for a yeast infection that could be cleared up with 20 dollars worth of drugs i could go on and on about the amount of holes in this but i won't waste any more of my time suffice to say that i have rarely been so insulted by such a dreadful piece of drivel and as for the real problem of sexual slavery girls go voluntarily to new in distant lands and are abused raped and often killed by the gang master who meets them off the boat plane and takes their passports and freedom this s t is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by this do not waste your time
<START> not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires touching our favorite trash cult genre is nice unfortunately this movie of originality and the performances do not come up with the trash standards seem the creator's intention to make it cult it failed trash movies are trash movies because it happens you cant create in purpose this kind of films i don't know if mr is a legend first time i heard his name but if he is i wonder the reason br br awful even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic x films will not be satisfied as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires
<START> i would be interested to hear from the director barbet schroeder as to why he decided to make more his first film and more specifically what his interest in hippies or rather this form of the euro hippie paradise and about their demise the film is at least true enough to keep one interested but in its own kind of truth it's strange biased it's a given heroin aka horse is awful stuff rotten the conclusion for many a dumb headed drug user that sees that as the be all end all because it basically is after that everything else stops that becomes the life and it's either a continuous run for more of the same or death more starts off as something concerning a romance between a new york girl and a german man but it becomes something else for better or worse sometimes both in the same scene br br it's basically about two young people estelle and stefan who meet in a city where stefan has come as a sort of wanderer away from his home country she's wandering too sort of and is maybe too friendly with a big time pusher named wolf they end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and after a somewhat daring grab for some horse by estelle they also find a pad in the form of a seemingly house along the seashore comment on youth and sex and drugs isn't too simplistic which makes the film actually lucid and intelligent so many years later it's both direct and subtle more about the characters and then about the fact that what he's depicting could in other hands just be a propagandistic hippie exploitation picture perhaps most pleasantly and this is just a guess schroeder uses as inspiration the sort of long sequence from bergman's summer with monika two kids in an inexorable connection some good some definitely not so good set against too perfectly shot landscapes br br on the one hand i should mention that there are problems some big ones in fact the performances aren't very convincing throughout a few scenes strike some power or have the actors in a good connection with one another but klaus overplays himself even if he is an ornery german by nature in that case i would've preferred klaus kinski in the part to make it crazier but deep enough for the subject matter as does farmer to her own degree and there's gaps of naivetÃ© in the screenplay that keep it from being as deep as it really thinks it is on the other hand there are two big things going for it nestor the great cinematographer i e days of heaven is dp and is a big boost for a first time director like schroeder nearly every image is seen with an awesome purpose or artistry be it a shot of the cliffs by the sea or sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room br br the other thing is pink floyd probably the main reason i and many others have heard of the film in the first place years before i knew really who schroeder was i saw the more soundtrack whenever i looked up pink floyd albums it's very good music throughout occasionally the mind blowing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve some of it too is a little tedious even as it is a movie that concerns free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time i wouldn't rank it anywhere near as high as a meddle or animals certainly not dark side but it too helps to elevate the subject matter another notch particularly when one least expects it or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings as stefan or other walks on the streets it's almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves but overall more is still worth watching as a period piece dated but potent like a less ambitious but more substantial zabriskie point
<START> this film has got so much in it prehistoric society adventure romance true brotherhood violence sex religion all depicted abundantly without a single word uttered and how come it sucks so bad this film will make you rethink the origin of humanity if this were the product of anthropology you would rather defy darwinian theory and synthesis all together you cannot bear to watch this even with your brain shut down and now you are thinking i've got to see this i warned you i take no responsibility whatsoever should you regret spending over an hour staring at this piece of art well i did warn you this should be forgotten and buried for ever
