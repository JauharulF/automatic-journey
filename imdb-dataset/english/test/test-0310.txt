<START> why is it that such romantic movies that never actually go anywhere always start and probably end with crappy jazz it's not clever and it makes it look like a bloody tv movie this film was sappy slow paced boring unoriginal wooden and did i say boring br br harrison ford was probably trying to be mysterious and crude but he was just a crawling mumbling cop that seemed to walk into the congress woman's home like everything was fine when he behaved like a pervert staring at thomas with a pervy glare hardly ever bothering to speak br br and why the hell do they always get british actors to put on crappy accents they're casted because they're famous and everybody knows they're british precisely because they're famous
<START> acting 10 script 1 is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden while people may get away with this on stage on film it becomes deadly or at least deadly dull we're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that while brilliantly written adds up to nothing even worse every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds the only attempt to differentiate is to have teen waif anna paquin use the word ain't br br never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme the camera work is plain sloppy and for la residents the attention to geography is laughable hint the view out sean penn's front window is about eight miles away from the view out his back window and you can't drive south through hollywood and wind up in pretending to be burbank okay suspension of disbelief and all that and normally i wouldn't pay attention to little things like that because they are just vagaries of production but the fact that they did stick out so much despite the thespian pyrotechnics on screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise the script br br in short skip this one even on video picked the wrong quote from the scottish play for his title would have been better named a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing a bit long for the marquee perhaps but at least it would be honest advertising
<START> this movie doesn't even deserve a 1 10 this movie was a scam br br i swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were copied from carnosaur 1 2 3 the whole movie raptor was based of the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a thriller action packed dinosaur copy i loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that cant even afford or willing copy it without doing there own models is what america is coming to i recommend you see the carnosaur movie first all of them and then watch this and you will know what i mean br br spencer
<START> being a huge fan of bergman i had to search literally years to find this movie at a price less than 60 i mean and finally bought it a few weeks ago the basic premise of bergmans films are the relationships between the characters and how they deal with trying situations this film therefore is the same yet it is different because the setting is far different than most of the bergman films the i have seen br br it is set in wartime and the heros are caught in the middle br br it is riveting from start to finish and it once again proves that liv ullman is one of the best actresses of the 20th century a must see
<START> warning this may contain spoilers br br first of all i watch a lot lifetime movies and realize they are just that lifetime movies some are great really some are good and some are bad unfortunately this movie falls into the latter category it actually started out with some potential single divorced hard working mom who gets out of work at 2 00 am cuts a guy off while driving home from work and let's just say he doesn't take it too well the stalking begins immediately with phone call hang ups and escalates to her home being broken into and completely trashed so she goes to her mother's for the night and the next morning her mother's car blows up this seems to be just a pain in the butt for our heroine who deals with it by going underwear and jewelry shopping so the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe keeping and what does mom do she goes off to work leaving the kid all alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a pizza i couldn't believe it then it really gets stupid and the ending just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical too bad because it seemed to have possibilities
<START> i'm aware that there are some fans who might like this movie i'm aware that the idea of for god' might appear interesting to some to me however it's really boring br br the movie is simply boring when it does get a little bit interesting it gets stupid come on kirk fights against god and wins how low can we possibly get the only good part in the film is the camping scene at the first 5 minutes which is truly great but after that the movie becomes boring irritating with nothing more than a good music br br thank god we have star trek vi oops kirk beat him
<START> and i may be being generous the overwhelming majority of the movie consists of looped footage the shambling monster two women exercising the shambling monster again a bunch of people in the pool the shambling monster again none the worse for wear despite having been injured you get the picture i restrained myself from yelling get on with it already on several occasions br br and it doesn't help that the footage they used was poorly produced the sound is disconcertingly out of sync with the image and in the one scene where they tried to get artistic with the lighting and camera techniques the lighting guy holding the flashlight that provides the scene's only illumination is clearly visible in the shot br br my hope is that the production was the victim of some horrible disaster in which the original audio track and most of the footage was destroyed but they decided to release it anyways cobbled together from the editing room floor in memory of the heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save the real film the one with the plot and the interesting dialog sadly there's no evidence of this and i'm forced to conclude that in the immortal words of joel and the bots they just didn't care br br
<START> melancholy of is based on somewhat pat formula by now of japanese school drama anime the formula somewhat goes like this br br 1 the main protagonist comes from world outside the normal society and has super powers br br 2 there's a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role br br 3 a normal character is in there who shares the main role in the story br br 4 unusual things happens in an usual social settings br br 5 sometimes the story is about the main protagonist and the normal character that connects to the existence or destruction of the world br br 6 absolutely no effort is spent by anyone to gain all the magical powers they just have it br br 7 usually people outside of this tight nit group is not aware of their super powers and goes on with their daily lives br br so there you have it melancholy of is made along these lines which became the success formula for comics and anime in japan even though it follows a pat formula the series is superbly crafted and the episodes are always set in an interesting back drop within the normal social settings which always morphs into unusual circumstances surrounding each player in the story brings some unusual insight into the daily life that usually we are not aware of the philosophical twist of their insights are what makes this series extra entertaining the visuals are first rate and done beautifully br br the crazy ideas always seem to come up with along with complicated settings of the story may give you headache from time to time it's further complicated by the fact that the episodes are played out of sequence which further adds to the confusion when i watched the episodes in the chronological sequence some of the plots finally made sense i recommend you do the same it's much more entertaining to watch the series this way google br br list of the melancholy of episodes br br for the correct sequence of all the episodes and oh you might notice the headache while you're watching this like i did let me know if you had it too
<START> although i have rarely flown myself i am keenly interested in aviation and this film has added to the precious laughing stock in aviation cinema br br 1 why is the captain doing the ground checks why does he even measure the oil levels in the engines with turnaround times as low as 15 minutes in commercial aviation this is not a typical pre flight check br br 2 why does the captain kick against the aircraft tire strange kind of pressure check or anger management br br 3 the cockpit has a crew of 3 all large western two jets built since the 1980ies have a crew of 2 people now try a guess at how old the movie script is br br 4 a helicopter manages to fly alongside the crippled airliner must be a fast one and the captain's words to explain the maneuver to the passengers are indeed hilarious ones br br 5 with arrested elevator it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft it happens for example when any aircraft moves slower than the stall speed br br 6 the elevator have hydraulic after the collision with the business plane it would most probably have severed the hydraulic lines and thus make them useless for steering but it would not fix them in certain position br br 7 the fire in the aft galley was a stupid idea it was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the extinguisher and fight the fire regardless of who was actually trained to do that Â the flight attendant br br 8 at the time of collision the elevators would have been in a neutral position the film could have ended here br br 9 the flight engineer the third person in the cockpit has three bars on his uniform in reality flight engineers have two br br 10 why does the captain slash the cabin casing with an axe to examine the damage behind i thought it would have been the flight duty as he is already supposed to perform technical checks before and after flight br br 11 in any aircraft there is no unused space at least commercial airplanes cannot afford the luxury of a compartment that can be filled with tons of water br br i could go on and on but at last i laughed hysterically about how the screenwriters imagine aircraft disasters most aircraft disasters happen in such a short time span that you simply cannot make 90 minute flicks out of them but you can always fill 90 minutes with mind boggling and insane crap irrespective of the genre
<START> i believe that this was supposed to be shocking or something all that i can say is poor goat this flick is so poorly done that the parts that should shock and revolt you come across as laughable at best the characters are so lame and 2 wait 1 dimensional that i applauded each sick death all except that poor goat br br
<START> i must have seen this movie about four or five times already and it gets better with each viewing suffice it to say this is the best film i've ever seen and i think i've seen a lot br br but i've always wondered why this film got so shunned in some reviews or ratings for example take the imdb top 250 why does it rank only at 216 as of today surely the not in the film itself because that is nothing but flawless but in its reception the film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its anti death penalty attitude and so obviously the more conservative minded user probably didn't like the film as you can see from some of the other comments so dead man walking gets a ranking that's nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality those people didn't understand what the film wanted to say and maybe they didn't want to understand being pro death penalty so now i get it it's all political you're pro death penalty you don't like and therefore don't want to hear what the film has to say br br i'm truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefs br br mr robbins your movie's issue split people's opinions some reconsidered their point of view some simply didn't listen but you made a very important point your movie will probably never show up on any top 100 movies of all time list but it'll be remembered long after films like braveheart or babe or apollo 13 all of which were unjustly preferred over your film at the oscars 1996 are forgotten congratulations mr robbins and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking
<START> fritz lang directed two great westerns western union and the return of frank james the frank james movie equals jesse james western union is one of randolph scott's great westerns i have never seen robert young in a western before he is terrific as the telegraph employee this is the only movie i can think of that is about the telegraph company opening up in the west it is a high geared story about the telegraph in the west a triangle love story and about loyalty br br the supporting cast is superb dean jagger who made a few westerns plays the telegraph manager virginia gilmore who plays mr jagger's sister is the love interest in the movie ms gilmore had a short career in movies she quit films in 1952 and became a drama coach she is primarily known as the first mrs yul brynner it is great to see slim summerville in a movie with mr scott again they were in two other great movies rebecca of sunnybrook farm and jesse james
<START> let's cut through everything in the first paragraph the the newest film by the pang brothers danny and oxide as a horror movie is profoundly bad and just as a movie in general is a big disappointment it's nothing but a sixth sense and as long as that picture is still available there is no reason on earth to pay money to see this turkey br br lately horror slasher films such as the final destination series wrong turn boogie man the ring 2 and the grudge are becoming increasingly more reliant on big shocks with no payoff for instance something jumps out at the person on screen elicits a gasp from the audience but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something little goes into making it a genuine frightening experience like the sixth sense or signs or some of the classic horror movies of the 1940s '50s and '60s br br the relies upon the same old tired clichÃ©s as these newer far inferior films and is therefor old tired and to my surprise ended up as one of the most boring movies i have seen in awhile br br the plot has another stupid family led by dad roy dylan mcdermott the practice mom denise penelope ann miller awakenings kindergarten cop tv series desperate housewives big sis jess kristen stewart a space adventure and toddler ben evan turner who move to north dakota from chicago br br the reason for the move is never really outlined here but it has something to do with the dad's inability to find work and jess' drunken driving escapades we know there will be trouble immediately because they move into a big gothic house in the middle of nowhere a domicile that looks like the munster's summer home oh and the first five minutes of the movie show something really horrible happened there br br jess hates the place hey who could blame her but optimistic pop hopes to make a go out of raising despite the unusually large amount of crows fluttering about but when he meets burwell john corbet raising helen and looking like kevin costner in the film version of my name is earl an itinerant drifter and expert on raising things start to pick up br br but then weird things begin to happen jess is terrorized by a violent unseen force in the house of course no one else but the two year old ben can see it so she's labeled a flake and the crows keep hanging around ben also is able to detect the unearthly creatures but since he's two he cannot articulate it scene after scene of people telling the little boy to tell them what he sees finally had me wanting to yell to the screen he can't tell you he's two freaking' years old yes have the only protagonist who can solve all of these things be a mute toddler is real smart br br anyway we're left to ponder the sanity of jess when and if ben will ever properly describe the paranormal visions he sees if dad will make the sunflower thing work if the high plains drifter is a good guy or bad what the point of the george plimpton looking realtor is how a pitchfork plunged in the back can only be a flesh wound what mom's role in the family is and where are all the crows coming from br br all of this while waiting and wondering for something anything to happen the conclusion is really lame as well and once again begs the question of how a spirit which has no physical body can cause harm to a living person very dull pointless and most terrible of all not frightening in the least br br oh and there are a lot of crows in this movie
<START> al pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity in other words when he could act he didn't have to talk like some street junkie mcconaughey must have been impressed by pacino because he became a promoter of the f word also this might be the kind of society that they actually live in but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company i don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity but it was something like this it shows a lack of intelligence poor language skills and disrespect for all those that have to listen maybe it is time that al takes some acting courses again to sharpen his talent oh yes the movie probably the worse thing that mcconaughey has played in hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people rene russo as always was hot
<START> i don't know about the real cobb but i got the distinct impression that the filmmakers' aim was to try to soften his jagged edges and reputation not give us a true portrait of the man himself in the movie besides a few racist remarks he's shown to be just another hard nosed old coot he's so full of life with a heart of gold more or less this is also the worst acting i've seen t l jones do he brings nothing new or subtle to his stereotyped character he just doesn't flesh out cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie not for one minute did i forget that it was tommy lee jones on the screen pretending to be ty cobb robert wuhl didnt impress either the comedic elements in this movie were just distracting and didnt ring true at all a bloody waste of time it is
