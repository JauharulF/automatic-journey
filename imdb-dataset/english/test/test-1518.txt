<START> i haven't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent b western or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most nothing could be farther from the truth this movie is one huge non sequitur it is an affront to the noble b western films of the '30's i have seen many of wayne's early lone star and republic westerns and this one is easily the worst br br the bad guy is known as the shadow for crying out loud initially the shadow's scheme is holding up open sided stage coaches simultaneously his gang rustles all of the cattle in the territory then they decide to move on to bank robbery to do this they need to shoot up the town with a machine gun no explanation of why that's necessary or how he got that neato little toy br br no single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here the shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes br br he imparts his instructions to his gang through a fake wall safe knock knock who's there he is apparently clairvoyant because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him they knock on the wall the safe opens and presto he's there i can just imagine that he has met them face to face and says i have some secret nefarious instructions to give you about our next evil deed meet me at the wall safe and i'll give 'em to you just why the shadow requires the safe to communicate with his army of outlaws is like most of the elements of this mess never explained br br he has a nifty tunnel to the ol' hollow stump across the street from which vantage point various of his baddies perform assassinations he also has a hidden panel not in his secret lair behind the fake safe but out in the main room br br when not behind the safe he hangs out on his cow less ranch masquerading as rancher matlock we learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch two brothers and assumed the identity of one the daughter of the dead brother has recently arrived from 1930's nyc judging by her wardrobe and she apparently never met her real uncle because he dupes her too br br if you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good guys white hats you need to see this movie here the good guys all ditch their hats in favor of white head bands that make them look like they have all suffered head wounds before any shots have been fired it's like a game of pick up basketball only wayne has them tying 'round their heads instead of just taking off their shirts br br perhaps the weirdest of all is the ending immediately after subduing the shadow and his gang we jump far enough into the future to see wayne and his wife the while niece on the front porch of their home never mind that there has been scant romance there yak is playing with wayne's 3 4 year old son dressed up in injun garb fun br br no thanks to this nonsense wayne went on to become a screen legend only a super star or not could surmount this entry in a film resume long live the duke
<START> in my never ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime i stumbled upon this film on cable i tried hitchcock three times before this and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received i always felt he was good not great from what i've seen this was the best of his films i've seen robert walker is absolutely chilling his performance takes the film where hitchcock wanted it to go even an average performance here damages the overall product my favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain how exactly does he get his arm down there though bruno is quite a compelling character but i also loved the performance by patricia hitchcock as barbara the rest of the morton family as well as guy were a bit dry and boring but she added some flare to the movie as well as having some of the better lines in the script br br lastly in any suspense movie you're going to live and die by your ending this one holds water unlike a couple other hitchcock films i've seen i truly was unsure of how it would end which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited
<START> is a cinematic survey of gypsy music from several countries it is touching sad and joyous most of the segments appear to be completely unrehearsed the music ranging from the sensual flamenco music of the spanish gypsies to the melancholy music of the central european gypsies is exquisite if you love gypsy music you'll find absolutely beautiful br br
<START> more of a frisbee like turtle with fangs that go up like a wart hog more battles with people in bird suits that look like people in bird suits a ping pong ball space ship two naughty boys who know how to do everything including getting on board the space ship more tiresome music more gamera is the friend of children stuff i remember when and rodan came out the movies were a lot of fun because the monsters were actually a threat to people now they are just a parade of silly costumes with very little behind them the adults are all ridiculous and moronic like in american sitcoms the kids are the bosses when in reality they couldn't think their way out of a paper bag these monster movies must be the japanese means of these little above all however is that after seeing three of these movies with the same plot over and over check the stock footage the ultimate conclusion is that they are boring if you haven't see this one don't bother
<START> this was so bad i can't even review it so i'll jot some sentences about what i witnessed and it'll be up to you to decide br br captain kirk with toupee and tubby gut is rock climbing el capitan spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboard like kirk falls spock flies down catches him inches before kirk hits the ground head first br br later that night spock kirk and mccoy are eating beans around a campfire spock likes the beans then kirk and mccoy sing row row row your boat and want spock to join in on the three way harmony spock doesn't want to sing and later that night he disagrees but life isn't but a dream captain should i go on br br okay a renegade vulcan who happens to be spock's half brother leads a revolt on a sandy planet taking hostages the crew of the enterprise land on the planet and uhura pushing fifty five and weighing two hundred some odd pounds lures the natives with her bare legs but they can't trick the brother who claims he can find god br br he kidnaps the crew and the enterprise they go to a planet where a big bearded apparition claiming to be god spits fire at kirk spock and mccoy spock's sibling realizing it isn't god but is really a form of himself or something joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and sparks fly br br then after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving klingons who resemble lorenzo lamas br br the three amigos kirk spock and mccoy return to yosemite did i mention kirk was wearing a go climb a rock t shirt with spock playing some kind of funky vulcan guitar they sing row row row your boat this time all three as the credits roll
<START> for those of you out there who have seen this pic on vhs i would recommend the dvd in fact the vhs is utter rubbish the main reason is that the film was shot widescreen 2 55 1 and the producers ran out of money making the vhs version and released it as 4 3 the result is that several actors are not on screen at all and in many drag races less than half the cars are showing since one is on each side of the screen the dvd is actually a reasonable version of the film br br a lot of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release they were viewed as being too offensive to minority groups in fact the prospect of a us release caused even more cuts in the film for example the americans reputedly did not understand words such as petrol strides br br mike's dad and mum were meant to be hippies the dad survives in the film as a wasted dope smoking guitarist but the following scene with the mum was cut the scene took place in the roof space of the house which was lined with aluminium foil lights and filled with plants you get the picture the producers had rounded up a lot of real plants for the foreground and when they saw the result on the big sheet they freaked and the scene was cut cowards br br yes the film is noted as an australian cult classic voted 2 in street machines best 100 films of all time narrowly missing out to mad max ll the latter had over 10 times the budget of in fact the budget on was so small that the director could not afford to wreck any of the cars even though there would have been a public outcry if anyone had wrecked a real ho compare that with smoky and the bandit or blues bros where dozens of cars were wrecked br br so there's one real and two fakes one of the fakes was bought from the local indigenous community in after the standby crashed into the back of the country boy's truck that was unscripted the car was meant to burst out from the side of the truck because the budget was so tight the car was made up with ordinary brown masking tape instead of the painted on gold trim of the real thing br br the 55 is absolutely real the car began as a very plain 4 door and was brilliantly and quickly converted to the blown '55 in the film the motor was a which made around 1000 this was reduced to around 600 for the filming the car was able to easily to 170 mph as show in several scenes in the film br br just for the record anyone with 12 000 could have picked up all the cars after the film the ho the dodge the ute 53 the lot wonder where they are now br br sw
<START> come on anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel they should not be allowed to be heard because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever br br anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by tex avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch huckleberry hound episodes for 20 years straight br br the takes and double takes by the wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film br br tex avery should receive a posthumous academy award for this cartoon it's the best
<START> with its few touches of surrealism works as low grade horror but as a major follow up statement to the original it flounders miserably br br things begin somewhat promising during the opening credits we see and hear several interesting shots and sounds the baby's black crib with the inverted cross the kitchen knife rosemary carried into the apartment and dropped in shock the is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor and the emptiness of the itself without tenants or furniture voice overs can be heard here from the previous film's dialog interesting too is the easter egg hunt the titular child participates in the eggs and baskets are also black once the story gets rolling it never really and what happens to rosemary when she boards that bus and is whisked away to god knows where br br patty duke a poor replacement for mia farrow ray milland and tina louise as the southwestern whore who raises the child adrian andrew head this almost star cast with ruth gordon reprising her minnie role br br although not a total failure this sequel of sorts should have been released in book form first then maybe we all could have been a bit better informed and not left totally in the dark a fairly recent sequel novel son of rosemary 1999 is the legitimate followup by ira levin himself br br
<START> on a scale of 1 10 suicidal sweetheart got an 11 from me and from everyone else at this showing the picture was incredibly funny i told my wife it's obvious that this man walks on water but across a bed of fire that's a bit much this is one of the very best blends of comedy satire and uses of innuendo i have seen since mel brooks' young frankenstein i can't believe this picture was not picked up by a major studio br br this film festival audience was sophisticated and was able to pick up on every comic innuendo either visual spoken or implied the characters are real and the combination of a great script and a great casting was obvious max and grace are real people with real problems that are dealt with regardless of the odds of success it keeps you smiling while being serious and laughing with all the indirect humor brilliantly built into this production br br to sum it up this is a must see picture
<START> imagine watching a slide show where the projector lingers on every slide long enough for you to completely memorize it three times over now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes Â a small park and empty tennis court a piano now imagine that the people running the slide show are having a frustratingly slow semi lucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides they're showing you great Â you've just imagined the entirety of the film india song ' br br the film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little except to simply scream out look at me i am profound ' with such blatant self importance that the images themselves and the movie as a whole are rendered not merely bereft of profundity but comically bereft of profundity the visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images as described above since it is so rare that there are actually people on screen and even when they are the people actually move only slightly more often than the furniture they never speak or interact in any meaningful way Â they just stand there looking at each other and occasionally crying the most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk across a parking lot in slow motion in fact the visuals could easily have been left out entirely as the story is told completely through narration the story is about a woman who hates india because it's hot and hates people don't hate india because it's hot this point is covered several times it is also about a man who feels that he is entitled to sleep with the aforementioned woman since she will sleep with anyone who asks her to but he doesn't get to sleep with her simply because he never asks and he's very upset about this so he stares at her as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek later on he stares at his bicycle as a single tear runs profoundly down his cheek actually you don't get to see the single tear running profoundly down his cheek when he's staring at his bicycle but you know it's there anyway just because that's the sort of film this is br br at best the narration becomes background hum serving as a perfect compliment to the coma inducing visuals simply staying conscious through the entirety of this film would require a supreme act of determination to watch it and actually come away with a serious and meaningful idea of what it was supposed to be about would induce the same sort of migraine as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark this film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudo artistic pretension that man will ever know
<START> the movie starts off with reeve ekin and his assistant fighting same vampires this scene is probably the best out of the entire movie the rest of the movie unfortunately is cheesy highly unrealistic and a buffy the vampire slayer ripoff the ending also sucks big time br br some moments such as the scene where gypsy and helen played by popular chinese duo band twins charlene gillian fight over a stuffed teddy bear are particularly cringeworthy the storyline is also lame surely they could have come up with something more scary than a book called day for night br br some good parts though jackie chan and anthony wong make the movie bearable with their comical roles however the good bits just end there charlene gillian from twins have never been able to act well and annoy you to pieces and the friendly but wussy vampire role was unfortunately given to edison chen who is a talentless pretty boy br br rating 4 10
<START> this movie was sooo bad it wasn't even funny at all not even the sarcastic scenes were funny oh man bad so bad thumbs down spoofed karate kid teen wolf footloose dirty dancing some kind of wonderful soul man and probably another or two chris kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer who runs a dance studio in a warehouse he has a jealous girlfriend who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer who chris has eyes for i thought the acting was really bad i like laugh out loud comedies this was not one not another teen movie wasn't funny but had a lot more funny scenes than totally awesome scary movie is funny i always laugh when i watch those super enjoyable this movie not funny

<START> is a full moon production i knew what to expect very little quality but i didn't expect this to be as painful as was to watch br br it's just awful bad acting confusing script and direction annoying characters i wanted to kill the whole thing was probably made in one week i've seen episodes of charmed that were more complex and convincing than this cheapie br br it has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a badly conceived tv series no one has ever seen it was a chore to watch and i could feel my mind getting and by the minute watching a movie shouldn't be this much hard work
