<START> this was a pretty good movie i love fighter jet movies and this was the best one i've seen lately it was made using real planes so that made it an even better movie if you like watching u s f 16s blow the living daylights out of their enemies this is a great movie for you
<START> it's quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be simultaneously so insightful about gay bi sexual relationships and their struggles br br pool days is about the awkwardness of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one a story about experience and vulnerability br br a friend of dorothy portrays a common dilemma many gay and bi sexual people experience at some point in their life the intense attraction towards someone whom is heterosexual sensitively examined this story truly left me feeling moved br br the disco years shows another version of a no win situation getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight a very empowering story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person br br while these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay bi sexual or searching each story is uplifting in its own unique way
<START> our reviewer from toronto told you what you need to know about this film except note that it needs editing the hand held technique gets really old really fast i saw this film last night in france we are in the valley which is covered with and of course wine makers they were all there in the salle de for the showing crammed in polite patient genial although my french is testy i got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the old terror growers interviewed esp the one from a communist village in he got a lot of laughs this is unusual in france laughing aloud there is no question which side of the terror globalization war they are on sm
<START> this movie has every clichÃ© of every terrorism or airliner crisis movie br br however it is not entirely unwatchable thanks to good performances by rowland and and maybe br br what is amazingly bad though is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes boy oh boy the cgi scenes in the last starfighter filmed in 1984 are better than these filmed 17 years later the feeling of really sends shivers down your spine br br a pity this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste
<START> i have now suffered through parts the horror br br to have the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror br br the story was about a cloning central owned by the the man they grow clones for harvesting organs from the clones later on for the original humans in need of transplants one clone escapes the government gets angry and kills all involved but the story somehow leaks out anyway br br it is truly shameful how a movie with potential is destroyed by amateurs such as the only thing he genuinely succeeded in doing was to weave in the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect what makes a human a human and would it be ok to grow clones for organic harvesting sadly mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left town until the very end in where a pathetic attempt is made to sum it up br br but what disturbed me the most was the introducing of new characters lacking actual relevance for the plot despite that feels the need to kill them off in a bad explosion which only sir coleman francis himself would be proud of br br the setting was interesting how thought that pulling out sheets of plastic and running water over them would make a believable river is beyond me but i guess if you were to compare the setting to coleman francis' gray pasty oatmeal of a setting this film would win br br perhaps coleman has changed what bad movies are for me 3 10
<START> although i think the reviewers who hated this movie have encapsulated exactly what it does wrong everything i had to add my two cents if you'd like a long version of how terrible this movie is please read the review by br br here's the short version shameless use of the actors' names to propel the plot as opposed to using their talent no one brought their a game to this blatant commercialism i guess pepsi can afford to stick an advertisement or 40 into a movie now and a plot that was so convoluted with rock star clichÃ©s that it was totally ridiculous br br let me put it to you this way i was thinking of world' the whole time i was watching this movie but i wasn't laughing anytime you try to throw in steven tyler to help your movie plot along you've got serious problems br br please warn your friends and family this movie sucks
<START> having discovered the ring trilogy i have been gobbling up all those other japanese and korean films that are either on or following the bandwagon br br i don't have an easy definition of horror but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons even though i can't claim that the film makes a lot of sense i'm squeamish so there were several points in the film when i just didn't want to watch what was happening on screen the film unnerved me so i became apprehensive of seeing things that i thought i was going to see br br it's an imaginative film offering a great deal visually it also provides food for thought and plenty of material to argue about when the film is over br br the characters are well defined to say the least could they make films like this in the west br br so it doesn't make sense in the end but when one has an appetite for the occult the supernatural the bizarre the otherworldly then no film is going to deliver a final all explaining pay off
<START> warning may contain some minor spoilers br br hard to say anything bad about this movie except for one thing br br you don't get to see it much anymore then again maybe that's because you have to be home in the morning or at 3 am to catch it the fox movie channel br br too bad for this is another gem lost to time clifton webb takes his patented sour know it all demeanor he had perfected as lynn sitting pretty and sequels and turns boy' br br actually it's like this br br webb plays robert jordan the host of a sunday children's educational program that is losing audience share and the network breaks it to him that he needs to do something about it or else br br part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children br br bummer but as such things happen the local church pastor needs a leader for an unruly troop of boy scouts and finds a willing victim ahhhh 'volunteer' in the host so jordan he takes the position br br problem solved right br br wrong this being a movie there are other problems br br for example it turns out one of the scouts is the son of his boss at the tv station which causes a little friction especially since the kid is overweight has asthma as well as an attitude br br and he is the more reasonable one br br also there is this cub scout mike george winslow who wants to hang around being the type br br as it turns out the reason is that he has no folks of his own but is cared for by a relative who hasn't much time for him br br it is things like this that makes his job harder than expected br br all in all webb becomes more understanding of kids and not only saves his show but learns a rewarding lesson and eventually even adopts mike br br still a great movie after all these years
<START> it's fun to watch a young james cagney doing his thing he plays the weights and measures guy who takes his job very seriously stepping on the toes of a group of crooked politicians he is offered the world but keeps his integrity he is beaten and set up but that's the problem we never know if he is really in danger they say he's in a spot but still seems to have carte blanche to move around and do what he needs to do at times he's so cocky he doesn't do much to protect himself his allies are in the police department but just about everything else is pretty corrupt he perseveres almost too good to be true of course and we pull for him the problem for me is a lack of sustained suspense it would have been much better if he had had to clear his name he never drops into the depths even when rejected by his wife to be it's still fun with the bad guys kind of see it just to watch cagney do his tough guy posturing
<START> i haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way that i couldn't take my eyes off the screen i was busting for the loo and i didn't even want to pause it because i was drawn right in emotive powerful very moving horrific and heart breaking it gives you an amazing insight to south africa their struggles and their lives the acting by the leads were mind blowing and the script was incredible despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is i was captivated i don't want to even try and explain the story it's way too complex and i wouldn't do it justice please see this you'll understand why when you do cheers
<START> jesse yet again delivers after almost 12 months of hype about his upcoming production it finally reaches the dark world of the internet with more than a brilliant approach to amateur film making br br is a original nail biting commentary on a troubled child growing into an even more troubled adult if i had more than two thumbs i would give more but i think two will be enough br br great work from all cast especially by marissa and elizabeth the character of emily as an adult has given me shivers so far and i'm afraid of where she'll go next br br an excellent watch
<START> do not take this film seriously rent it with some folks who want to play mystery science 3000 and you will probably laugh your butts off the evil guys are so not scary it's funny it's like some dude from 7th grade with a sickle in a scarecrow get up the acting is hilarious i love the occasional self torture with a poor horror film and this really had me giggling i recommend it on that basis of course recreational drugs will enhance the experience oh there is a naked group swimming scene that will allow for some star dust on the 5 star system the token black male gets injured badly but continues his joking as well as using the injured body part quite readily throughout enjoy this complete and utter disgrace to films
<START> a girl is looking for her soul mate this movie was very strange lots of sequences that look like an hallucinations tommy lee jones is the only stable one in the picture it was hard to figure out what the director was trying to say most of the time the main character is dressed in weird clothes and makeup a weird combination of reality and madness
<START> well i expected for all the hype and oscar nominations an epic civil war drama something with the magnitude of the english patient given the same director this film isn't of epic stature but it turns out i was relieved it wasn't it's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight are tracked and killed and the women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while the men are gone br br anyway i thought nicole kidman and rene were pretty decent and not knowing much about jude law he was all right also it seems rene z had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to smartly play a spirited feisty downhome woman with much aplomb also for me it was good to see actress kathy baker someone's who's talent needs to be more recognized acknowledged br br this film is worth seeing this i'm can't articulate why really but maybe because it is a slice of americana br br
<START> i had never heard of this movie but i like heath ledger and bryan brown and the story sounded interesting so i figured i'd give it a shot i found it to be very enjoyable heath ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough so he goes and asks for work from mobster bryan brown i won't go into details but things go very bad for ledger and gets into big trouble with bryan brown from their on the movie just gets better and better with one scene involving ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers and lets not forget the beautiful rose byrne who plays ledger's love interest i would definitely recommend this movie
