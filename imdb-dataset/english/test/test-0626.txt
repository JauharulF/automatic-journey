<START> early 1950s sci fi directed by lesley special effects of course are very primitive but pretty good in comparison to what else was out there then drive in movie double feature fare still interesting enough to watch two leading men arthur franz the brilliant young scientist dr jim barker and straight talking and earthy newspaper reporter steve abbot cameron mitchell are joined on a manned flight to mars by carol stafford virgina huston another scientist and two other space experts richard gaines and john litel upon landing on the red planet the space travelers encounter inhabitants that appear friendly and mentally advanced in actuality the martians are led by morris who has the idea of conquering earth to their civilization there is a beautiful martian chapman that dr barker intends to take back on the return trip she is the movie's redeemable element
<START> i just watched this short at the movies br br was a very sweet sad little movie about two brothers that are in love there is some great subtle acting from both the male leads often times movies with this subject matter seem to get too caught up in the controversy and shock value of the plot that they forget that there is an actual story luckily writer director james does not do this and instead lets the story play out with honesty the sequences of the two boys first falling in love are very sweet
<START> if you're a kid liking fairy tale real life adventures see it if you're a youth liking kids movies why not see it if you're a parent going to see a movie with your kids you're way better of opting for the squirrel br br the start of this film was a bit funny and set some good premises for the happenings to take place but after the kind of funny introduction of characters settings and potential conflicts the story turned out kinda dull when more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time the word predictable repeatedly comes to mind just like parts of a lp or those commercials you really hate and the culmination of the plot oh sigh poor poor poor
<START> when this show first aired i will admit to being intrigued by the premise and the setting with an open mind i watched the first two episodes and naturally dismissed it as being destined to run for a half season at most i happened to be watching a e recently and witnessed an ad for this garbage and i could barely contain my surprise i truly hope people are watching this for a laugh and not taking it seriously the characters are truly some of the most ridiculous and outright laughable on television scripted or otherwise it's obviously generating ratings so i must give the creators credit for establishing and maintaining a fanbase but i seriously hope no one is watching this under any pretense of seriousness
<START> when the hit i was in hershey pa and part of the skate team we didn't do anything except skate around trying to learn what we were reading in the pages of skateboarder magazine a couple of local hills provided all the speed wobbles you could handle at the time mike weed was the hot stuff along with russ whats his name with the z boys hot on their tail i had a gt plastic board with power paw wheels loose bearings br br my parents told me we were moving to california later that year and that they were taking a trip to go house hunting i was an extremely good son that summer and asked if i might not be rewarded with a real skateboard from california they delivered it was a deck with the surfer magazine logo screened on it wide trucks and big red wheels precision bearings don't ya know they got it at oak street a surf shop in laguna beach br br when i got to california all of 13 anaheim had the concrete wave and had a great park as well soon came skateboard odyssey in mission viejo an indoor park with every scenario imaginable all the while i was reading about stacy tony and jay this flick was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch
<START> dolemite is awesome rudy ray moore's kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof citizen kane this may not be nor les infant au but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right the production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects the plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the film lovers through the infamous ever present boom mike evokes shades of the gloriously incompetent ed wood and never grows unfunny i sometimes wonder if the boom mike was left in on purpose as commentary on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general but i usually get distracted by erotic scenes that lack eroticism to the point of high art everything is this movie is alive and breathing dripping with desperate longing to be simultaneously loved and reviled it works br br 9 out of 10
<START> this is one of those movies where you have to put to one side some of its obvious shortcomings a result of the date and location of its production and accentuate the positive in many ways this is a truly superb film br br forgive the parody in the one line summary but the most serious shortcoming for an english speaker like me was the ghastly subtitles the print i saw had 1982 soviet film export subtitles which consistently used inverted grammar presumably to give the impression of 13th century speech the actual impact of this nonsense is to make it harder to follow the subtitles which means you spend less time looking at the images given that the cinematographic imagery is this films great strength this is a real issue br br other imdb have written plenty about the stalinist propaganda elements of this film just in case the viewer doesn't notice them for him herself they have also written plenty about the battle on the ice scene which is superb in my view br br the love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and yet strangely almost totally lacks charm also but it is good to cringe every now and then br br i was familiar with the music to this film long before seeing the film the images and the music complement each other marvelously and it is the images that will stick in the mind for a long time bergman clearly learned a lot from these images the imagery of his medieval pieces e g the seventh seal the virgin spring building upon and enhancing eisenstein's ideas this film was made in 1938 in the ussr in that context it is a masterpiece albeit a flawed one br br for the modern viewer i suggest that you go with the flow and enjoy the many treats on show
<START> i shouldn't like jackass number two no one should there is and never has been anything particularly redeeming about jackass and yet it's one of the funniest things i have ever seen and i simply cannot explain why br br this new movie leaves the first one in the dust it's so funny so horrible and so wrong the whole team give their all with in chief knoxville leading the charge he's nuts i adore him but he's insane and more power to him with his burgeoning film career he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work but the fact that he threw himself almost literally back into the world of the so wholeheartedly makes me oddly respect him more kudos must go to bam who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted here bam isn't the tormentor but the tormented and is all the better for it br br i simply can't say what my favourite part is because i laughed the whole way through admittedly i viewed much of the movie from between my fingers but there hasn't been a 'real' movie i've seen in a very long time that made me feel as invigorated as this did love them or most probably hate them the jackass team have delivered above and beyond my expectations but i do agree with bam there can never be a jackass number three because someone will die and i want these guys to stick around
<START> years ago i used to watch bad movies deliberately somehow i missed this one no gesture rings true no facial expression fits the scene or the action i've never heard such inappropriate music for a film at the final scene i was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid one of the worst child actors ever br br only one name in it i ever heard of wilford brimley he must've been very hungry to take this part br br do not under any circumstances watch this movie you've been warned
<START> i went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go br br we were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended in order to see how much more we had to endure two hours and six minutes long it is it's divided roughly equally between battle scenes about a dozen of them all more or less interchangeable and plot development br br one would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world plotting would have been relatively easy there's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story however the writers fluffed it completely we get no real history we get instead a hollywood version of history br br what sustains young through his long almost endless actually or so they seem to the viewer tribulations why the love of a good woman of course br br how does he get out of prison well an old monk who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that love for her dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there talisman in his hand and of course she then goes and having inexplicably become rich and powerful rescues him br br how does he escape from the shackles well he goes off to the shrine of the great wolf god or some such name and sets him free by magic yeah right br br why does he want to become ruler of the mongols the wolf god again apparently off goes to ask for guidance and surprise surprise he gets it laws he says to himself what the mongols need are laws good simple ones golly it was impressive br br and then finally how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces better tactics certainly but also through the aid of the good old wolf god again who sends a storm at the height of the battle all the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes mongols are scared of thunder you see but not our the troops completely wowed by his bravery acclaim him king br br i don't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage the funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism lots of slurping of milk dirt and violence it's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is br br there's heaps of violence in graphic close up slashings impalings spouts of blood sprays of blood clouds of blood the blood guys had a great time actually despite the realism it's impossible to take seriously br br i must mention the ludicrous cgi final battle scene how anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me they don't oh and it's all shot in the standard hollywood style breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery and the super close up stedicam stuff for the battle scenes and the standard dolby super sound effects of and thumps and the constant low frequency hum to sustain tension br br tedious br br avoid
<START> i finally found a version of persuasion that i like anne doesn't look like a scullery maid in this version just a very thin aging pretty woman quite like she's described in the book captain wentworth doesn't look like he's 50 nor does he look perpetually angry but rather as he's described in the book he hasn't aged as much as anne and is quite handsome and they play their parts with such conviction and realism that's what acting is all about they were believable they created real characters and it was like the characters in the book came to life if you haven't seen this version i urge you to find it order it or request it from either a bookstore or a library if you must it's worth the price and worth the wait br br i watched the 1995 version and the 2007 version and this one towers over the other two why it isn't rated higher is beyond my comprehension the book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life
<START> i really enjoyed this movie during the movie i felt that i wanted and captain to get together i heard myself screaming come on kiss her the movie has a happy ending good movie to watch in the evening when you want to chill
<START> the vietnam war era is certainly far before my time but it has always interested me and i have seen many films about it all of the others i'd seen had dealt strictly with the front line of battle when i read a description of the war at home i found the concept intriguing no vietnam war movie i'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with br br one night while flipping through channels the movie aired on the sundance channel i set down the remote and settled back to watch it i did not move from my seat during the entire two hours it's one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there is no way to predict what is going to happen next br br this movie made me a huge fan of emilio estevez i had enjoyed him very much as billy the kid in the young guns movies but i never saw anything he did afterward emilio proved to be very talented at writing and directing as well as acting br br the pacing of the movie is done extremely well i am hard pressed to think of a point where it drags br br what amazes me is that it didn't get an oscar or any real recognition when it came out it is a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not who he used to be and probably will never be as they remembered him again definitely worth seeing
<START> this is wes craven at his worst this is the very worst horror if you can call it horror you will ever watch esp from one of the masters of horror wes craven poor direction poor acting poor set poor atmosphere makes this the biggest pile of rubbish ever the bad guy is totally unconvincing you couldn't even feel sorry for the guy the gore and horror involved in the film is laughable it's just plain rubbish the only good points i can think of is it stars natasha gregson wagner giovanni ribisi and lance henriksen but not even that cast could stop this from spiralling out of control and into one of the worst horrors ever if you still ain't watch it yet don't bother you'll only hate it
<START> produced at a point in his career where he had the juice to do whatever he wanted eddie murphy took on the task of producing directing co writing and starring in harlem nights an expensive looking but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners gangsters running a ritzy club during the 1930's headed by a wisecracking hot shot eddie murphy and his adopted father richard pryor and their attempts to avoid being overrun by white gangsters who think they are taking over turf that it seems they think is rightfully theirs simply by virtue of their color this was an idea that probably looked great on paper but it definitely lost something in the translation this was a vanity piece for eddie and i think he spreads himself a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here admittedly it was a pleasure seeing murphy and pryor together on screen but the rest of the large supporting cast including hall redd foxx della reese michael lerner danny aiello jasmine guy thomas mikal ford stan shaw and eddie's brother are really given precious little to do though i will admit murphy's fight scene with della reese is hysterically funny and probably the movie's best scene murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it shows on screen the art and set direction are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have won an oscar but this one was a big miss for eddie as he definitely tried to wear too many hats
