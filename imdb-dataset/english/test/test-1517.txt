<START> the main attraction of anywhere but here is the superb performance of natalie portman she gave her rather thankless character a lot of much appreciated emotional depth susan sarandon a fine actress is suitably sincere as the mother figure i thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script i am not saying the script was bad in any way i am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times i don't think it was the script writer's fault the film did suffer from being overlong and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes the film does look beautiful with some good direction and excellent performances all in all watchable certainly but maybe more for an older audience 7 10 bethany cox
<START> director kinji is perhaps best known in his homeland at least for his japanese gangster films a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both samurai and battles without honor and humanity and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die and since so little is done to develop them their deaths have little impact when they do come this film has other flaws as well the makeup costumes and sound design are distractingly poor and the battle scenes were substandard as well inferior to other samurai films of earlier years seven samurai comes to mind br br sonny chiba plays the sonny chiba character in samurai the no nonsense master swordsman who strides through the film scowling menacingly what a guy he even gets to wear an eye patch if you were expecting to see the legendary toshiro mifune you may be disappointed his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting he disappears for good br br overall the strengths of the film are its story which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father who may have had some help on his way out early on it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn't be more clearly good and evil after all the older brother stammers and has a birthmark the sure sign of a villain eventually however it becomes clear that in a winner takes all struggle for power there are no heroes and villains only winners and losers
<START> it's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released the dialog was unnatural especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step father i guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog but what was said seemed false and artificial the suspense just wasn't there the music was about as bad as it gets the only reason i watched this movie was because i live in the death valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen fortunately the movie was on tv and so i didn't waste any money renting this sorry excuse for a film i honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here it's too bad that the time of an entire film crew was wasted on such trash i guess the only positive thing i can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good
<START> anne natalie portman tells us about how much she hates her mother adele sarandon that's how the movie begins adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to california without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason the story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter it's really deep and touching thanks to the great work of the actresses natalie was nominated to a golden globe for that role she is one of the most talented actresses i ever saw and so is sarandon they really look like mother daughter the soundtrack is also great the movie is incredible 10 out of 10
<START> i was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip although it started out slowly i found that the realism in depicting the ship the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching the protagonist was destined to be challenged grow and change on this voyage and i wanted to be there for it i was not disappointed the series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in between often in the same scene the same breath there was a wealth of emotional interaction and expression relentless and compelling to observe the movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next br br edmund talbot is a complex character the likes of which we don't see often we may know where the captain stands or mr but they are older men set in their ways talbot was young and arrogant still learning testing himself and being tested he struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched that grew with each hard taught experience i appreciate the excellent characterization it's too rare in movies and television
<START> director who brought us big budget debacles like the avengers and the remake of diabolique has directed this ripoff of the die hard concept done on what looks like a blair witch budget br br a california nuclear reactor is overtaken by arab terrorists but are you ready the terrorists aren't arab they're really disgruntled american soldiers masquerading as arabs we find out that they don't really intend to blow up the reactor just make a statement we're not sure what the statement is but never mind so there's really no threat but then one of the terrorists decides to go it alone and actually blow up the plant because he's kind of crazy so maybe there is a threat after all but the army goes in and all the bad guys are killed so there was no threat oh and a good guy is killed too let that be a lesson to everybody br br if all of this sounds muddled and kinda of a waste of time then you got the idea of what watching meltdown is all about br br the script never bothers to introduce the characters or to even give any personal details that might flesh them out or emotionally involve the audience so we're left with one dimensional characters the expert that nobody will listen to the trigger happy sergeant the slimy politicians the dweeby engineers the story skips from one clichÃ© incident to the next in a formula composite of practically every action movie you've ever seen but at nearly every turn just when we think something may be at stake the script flinches and we find out there's actually nothing to worry about br br like die hard there's an police officer who's on the inside unbenownst to the bad guys the big twist is that the cop here is a woman oh and she's injured too but not that bad just enough to make her wince a couple times oh and instead of the walkie talkie that bruce willis had this cop has a magic cell phone that works everywhere even underground when he's not yelling at everybody else bruce greenwood his jaw made out of granite tries to soothe her over the walkie talkie he even makes a joke once but we're afraid his face might crack after all this is serious business br br but mostly it's scene after scene of people arguing the military expert is arguing to wait it out his reasoning doesn't seem particularly sound but he's supposed to be the smart guy in this movie so the people at the white house argue with him the army sergeant argues with him too the nice pakistani nuclear engineer argues with the main terrorist the dialogue is absolutely b movie all the way and lines like stop the broadcast stop the broadcast may have you in rolling off your sofa as you wonder if the characters are actually referring to this silliness br br maybe to compensate for the lack of production quality the camera work is kept jittery in that faux documentary 21 grams style that's supposed to lend immediacy and energy to the scenes but the way it's indiscriminately and amateurishly applied here it's downright annoying even pretentious further attempts to ratchet up the tempo are made with the inclusion of nonsensical black and white footage that's randomly intercut with the main action but this too is pretentious and annoying in that blair witch kinda way in short the stylistic attempts look very amateurish br br the music lives up to the visuals it's and cheap sounding sort of like a porn movie but with less melody and lots more heart beat sounds the graphic treatment is howlingly bad too cheesy graphics in huge red font scream out to us 9 28 pm as though the actually makes some kind of difference br br meltdown may work as a marketing concept but it's clear that the script was a second thought fx part of fox put this cheesy production together and dropped several million dollars on it now that's what i call a meltdown
<START> made at the height of the black power movement this movie portrays african american arnold johnson getting made ceo of a corporation after the white ceo dies the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous ceo once in power he decides to turn it into a militant organization br br i don't know how robert downey sr did it but he did it is the ultimate jab at america's power structure it's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of richard pryor's mind this is a comedy classic in every sense of the word a real masterpiece hilarious
<START> i rented dark harvest the first one because it looked like a cheesy monster on the box type of thrill ride scarecrows also freak me out the movie had an effective title sequence but what followed was pretty lame flat bad lighting acting editing direction recently i noticed that dh 2 the maize had a pretty extensive ad campaign i thought maybe the first one was marginally successful so they upped the ante on this one a bit possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and fx from the killer scarecrows well there are no scarecrows in the video not a problem the problems start in dh 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept with strange shapes and bars wiping away titles and whatnot as far as the actual photography every time the sun shines in a shot you'd have all these blown out whites confirming that you're watching some ultra low budget mini dv project that some filmed at his uncles farm the acting was not acting at all the cheap rip off of the shining twin girls was below freshman film student standards the editing was extremely amateur and lazy the sound was jarring and choppy e g every time the editor would cut to a new shot you'd here the sound change perspective with it it's as if someone gathered their friends and family actors took a video camera out in a cornfield for three days put a light on top of it for the night sequences no joke that's what they actually did burned through some tape stuck the footage in their computer cut a very rough version tossed in some music bypassed any imaginative sound work or mixing burned it directly to dvd and threw it on the video store shelf any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct to video work that is void of any skill or style just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get somewhat of an image on tape doesn't mean it should be released to the public if i could give this a rating lower than a one i would
<START> there's something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some cheech and chong material one of the songs in up in smoke well i often wish more songs these days began that way but in this excuse for a video the stoner duo are showing us the videos for four songs from their album of the moment also titled get out of my room you hear a voice over during the opening credits in which some anonymous producer describes the record as being a novelty recording that will just take up room on the charts unfortunately this opening voice over hits the nail right on the head br br most music recordings endorsed by the seem to keep to a rule of putting the best material early in the album often when one gets past that first song the discerning listener notices that the recording has little if anything to hold their attention bands that defied mainstream convention on the other hand often saved their best material for last or at least spread it evenly throughout the disc in this case cheech and chong appear to have decided to hedge their bets the opening piece get out of my room is a hilariously themed song with an incredibly bad video many a viewer of a 1980s music video will find the sloppy direction somewhat nostalgic cheech's conception of british punk is also incredibly funny br br where it all goes downhill is the second number i'm not home right now nothing kills interest in a song quite like repetition and it's tough to get more repetitive than this aural turd honestly one feels the urge to slap cheech in the face and tell him that we get the idea he isn't home right now so please move on the next song along the theme of love being a strange thing is the absolute rock bottom not only for this collection but for cheech and chong in general it's almost as if this song was made for the sole reason of padding out the album's running time br br fortunately the stoner duo saved the best for last but it is also curious to note that chong is completely absent from this cut born in east l a is a simple number based upon the old bruce springsteen number that mocks reagan's view of multiculturalism as one is by cheech's tale one has to wonder how many poor schleps who couldn't speak a word of spanish were deported to mexico simply because their skin wasn't bedsheet white racism was an integral part of america's culture in 1985 and it remains so today if anything it has gotten worse so one has to wonder what born in east l a would be like if it were written in the current era br br unfortunately two cuts does not an album make especially when there is so much boring filler between them the interviews before get out of my room for example are quite funny not side splitting like much of up in smoke but funny enough to justify their existence unfortunately the two middle songs are reflected in their making of footage boring song makes boring filler if you cut out the middle half hour of material from this video you'd have something substantially better br br i gave get out of my room a three out of ten they are earned by the first and last video i'm pretty certain that the stars look at material like this today and wonder what they were thinking
<START> this one is a very solid randolph scott western he plays bat masterson and goes to liberal kansas to clean up the town he becomes good friends with robert ryan who played a very straight up leading man role it was not until after this that robert ryan began playing much darker roles in fact in 1947 randolph scott made one other movie which was not a western and never made anything but westerns after that until he retired in 1962 this movie has good pacing and builds up to the climax steadily i can't say any more as it would give away the plot be sure to see this one 8 10
<START> screening as part of a series of funny shorts at the sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival this film was definitely a highlight the script is great and the direction and acting was terrific as another posting said the actors' comedic timing really made this film lots of fun
<START> i've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and can't seem to do it but with a movie as bad as night of the blood beast the plot hardly matters an astronaut crash lands and is believed dead his body later reanimates but is found to be carrying the embryos of some strange alien life form but how did they get there and where's the alien that implanted the strange creatures in john body br br imdb lists the runtime for night of the blood beast at 62 minutes is that right 62 minutes it had to be longer than that it felt interminable to me even with the mst3k commentary which was very funny by the way the actual movie felt much much longer and it's pretty much a snoozer from beginning to end i like a lot of these alien invasion type movies of the 50s but not this one it failed to grab my interest on any level the baby aliens were too silly looking to be taken seriously the titular blood beast was pathetic and none of the characters did anything for me add to that the usual low budget roger corman trappings and you've got a real loser of a movie
<START> i only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much pornography has a useful purpose in society can't say i can always think of one but it probably does br br personal viewpoints set aside i really thought this film was pretty funny i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography i bought it because i am one of those 'alice' obsessives who will watch anything about in wonderland' i own just about every version there is on dvd so it was an obvious choice to complete my dvd collection with this i must admit i was beyond my expectations and the whole thing would have been thoroughly offensive if it hadn't been so damned funny besides the music is really good and i like musicals br br not everyone can make a good nudie musical anyone that has seen 'the first nudie musical' knows what a stink bomb that was considering what a low budget bill worked with 'alice' is pretty remarkable as a musical it's better than some musicals made on costly budgets br br the film can't totally escape the dirtiness of porn i usually watch the xxx version for full shock effect and some of those scenes are because we are talking about lewis carroll i found myself feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where 'alice' kristine debell starts masturbating it made me feel like a voyeur and the gratuitous lesbian scenes with 'alice' and the kitty cats were a bit too br br the film has a great sense of humor about everything however there is one especially funny moment during the queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says who do i have to f k to get out of this movie hilarious br br i'm not sure i buy the whole sex is good for you ball your brains out philosophy here but sex is human and nothing human disgust me i don't know if i really feel that way but i couldn't resist saying it some people think everything should be about sex i dunno jeez just show some responsibility and decorum this movie definitely scores points for the sex minded but i wouldn't push your luck next time you might really freak someone out i mean we are dealing with children's literature here
<START> when i saw the trailer for this film i said out loud to no one in particular this film is going to bomb i also said that about the matrix and look at what happened there now i am not a box office guru by any stretch but i usually have a pretty good gut about what is going to be good and what is going to really suck in this case i was blinded by my complete and utter apathy towards david duchovney let me put it to you a different way i don't like his as a person from what i have read of him in interviews he is unbelievably pre madonna like and he is full of himself considering all he has done is x files or as an actor playing god was a really poor film but he came off thinking that for some reason he deserved big bucks on the big screen but i am happy to say that even though those things may still be true about the man return to me is delightful and has it's heart in the right place bonnie hunt has directed a beautiful story and she has told it with class and grace this is one of the most romantic films i have seen and even though it may seem to be a bit sad and maudlin in its premise give it a chance and you will be hooked br br it has to be said and this pains me to do so that the reason this film works so well is because of the story and the cast duchovney and driver are so wonderful and believable here that i honestly wanted to cry along with them there is one particularly powerful scene when duchovney comes home after his wife has died and he slumps down on the floor of his house as it always does the family dog looks to the door to wait for his wife to come walking in she doesn't and with his shirt collar still stained with blood rob duchovney tells him that she is not coming home ever he then calls the dog over to him and they seem to share a cry together the dog lets out a small moan and then rob cries and this is one of the most realistic moments of pain i have ever seen in any character in any movie you can feel his pain and at that moment i forgot i was watching an actor that i generally don't like and i felt that i was watching someone that i knew the loss of his beloved this is powerful stuff br br another strength of the film is the supporting cast bonnie hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of irish and italian characters that share a common bond they share a pub called italian pub that is a delicious name all by itself and heading the scale of clashing cultures is carol o'connor and robert loggia these are two proud old men that love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece i think it is respectively and that is the character played by minnie driver this scenario is ripe for comedy and hunt doesn't miss anything here br br bonnie hunt and james belushi also share some funny moments together as the middle aged married couple and belushi gets top points as he accepts humility gracefully and shows off his ample keg of a stomach for laughs with his family consisting of three or four kids there is very little time for him and the wife to have quality time and again hunt handles this with perfect elegance br br this is a wonderful story of finding true love knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family return to me is a wonderful romance and even though i still don't have a great admiration for david duchovney i have to admit that he was perfect in this role and i could not picture anyone else playing his character he was sensitive and believable and the movie was good because of him not just because of him but he sure added to the flavour br br if you are a sucker for a good romance and you want a good cry then this is the film for you br br 8 5 out of 10 i will see anything that bonnie hunt puts out with her in the director's chair
<START> it's that film that loads of people hail as a classic apocalypse now now a re cut re up redux 22 years after it's original release br br the film is loosely based on conrad's heart of darkness it's main plot if it has one being capt willard's journey on a naval boat through the vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue colonel colonel kurtz we see the characters and situations he meets and he tells the colonel's story along the way br br my initial feelings towards the film is that it's not particularly gripping at times especially early on but at least a good dose of comedy is put in in the form of surfing fanatic col as the film progresses however a good deal of tension is built up with willard's reading through various reports on col kurtz until the end is in sight when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end br br the usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional and i found the performances of martin sheen marlon brando robert duvall and frederic forrest to all be worthy of a special mention the score i found initially sounded out of place but as the film progressed i'm not entirely sure if it did actually get better or it fitted better or if it had just grown on me but by the end of the film i was thoroughly enjoying it br br this is the second time i have seen the redux version i have seen the original around four times i'll say now that the first time i saw it i was disappointed i was expecting a classic film with lots of war the fact that willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that is the film seemed unnecessary this is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully as with all films that are more character than plot based as the second time around you know where the plot is going i had a similar experience with it's a wonderful life which is now one of my favourite films br br with the big four vietnam films apocalypse now wins over the rest on atmosphere but lacks the action and involvement of platoon the emotional intensity of the deer hunter and cannot really be compared to full metal jacket probably my favourite of the four apocalypse now is a great piece of work especially towards the end where it becomes staggering and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn't mind some casual violence
