<START> why is impossible to write in french very kitch this journey in the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities nevertheless current in 1976 these big of monsters is completely ridiculous the film deserve however a remake as was king kong the last one with a little more supplied scenario the professor has resemblances with the professor calculus and is rather funny david the character is enough inconsistent but cross spend to the people from below a good message you unite and will overcome you altogether we would say a film made in the 40s now that i said everything or almost the evil of which i thought of it we can say that if we have the brain get tired or anything has to see of the other one then the thing matter is even rather entertaining hugh such is my opinion translating french to english with sorry for possible mistakes
<START> i love pop culture but i was a little apprehensive when i first heard about this then i seen an episode and i love it i was a little upset when i found out that christopher would no longer be playing doctor who he was probably the best one they've had he fits the character so well it's sad to see him go i really don't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as br br i think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures such as the the story lines and characters can more than make up for that i'm currently waiting for season two and i will review that as well in case for any reason quality goes down br br anyways i think everyone should try to see one episode i did and i have been loving it ever since well written well casted and well produced this show is worth the hour of viewing doctor who gets a 10 10
<START> anyone who watched alien vs predator must've known that the conventions of the alien were not exactly adapted for the film amongst some of the unusual elements the rapid growth of the aliens over seemingly a matter of minutes aliens with extremely long tails and so on however the idea of the predator species providing the impetus of city and temple building to create a hunt for would be warriors sounded so appealing that i couldn't resist br br i had hoped the end of the film would not be the impetus of this sequel and unfortunately i was wrong for those who forgot how the first film ended the dead predator had an alien burst through his chest which carried the traits of both br br for this film i'm going to just go through a list of good and bad traits br br the good lots of gorgeous people especially the men br br the bad lots of gorgeous people get munched by both the mutant predator alien and the predator br br the good an interesting idea of the predator planet br br the bad an inconsistent scale of a town its a small town without many opportunities but with a very sophisticated read big city sewer system and homeless is it a small town or a city the police force is one sheriff and three deputies or so i counted br br the good um br br the bad why do these mutant aliens predators grow so fast in a matter of five minutes they seem to grow to their full size i mean c'mon what are these things chia pet aliens and while we're on this subject why is it that an alien inside a body mutates but an alien in a human's body doesn't does that make sense br br the good still thinking br br the bad why would only one predator come and why does it pour acid over all the remnants of the aliens but it decides to murder a cute deputy and then skin him and hang him upside down i mean so much for being incognito br br the good ah i'm stuck i guess there's lots of loud sounds br br the bad how do these mutated alien predators procreate apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss type of motion they deposit several offspring into the woman's body yeah just what you'd like to see eh pregnant women having their bodies explode into mutant aliens as if the previous way wasn't gross enough i mean there isn't even an alien queen br br the good did i say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous br br the bad when a nuclear device blows apart buildings how does a helicopter manage to survive the blast and how tacky is it for one of the passengers to mockingly chide the pilot i told you not to crash i mean given the nuclear fallout when he wakes up in the morning he'll have no hair left br br i could go on and on but i think you get the message mutated alien predator bursts through dead body grows over the matter of a couple of minutes kills all the predators and manages to get crashed on earth more mutant alien predators are created while one measly predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species predator kills humans mutant alien predators kill humans humans kill humans sucks to be a human in this movie eh br br if you're impressed by lots of bangs and bumps you'll love this movie br br if you liked the first i suggest you skip this sequel
<START> bonny hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut minnie driver and david duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry sure the plot is unlikely but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film carroll o'conner does a great job as grace's grandfather other great character actors play his card buddies jim belushi is hilarious as the down to earth husband of megan part of the extended family br br faith family and marriage are respected a few sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor br br and in the background that wonderful dean martin tune return to me br br recommended
<START> everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense unfortunately very little of delusion makes any sense jennifer rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man kyle secor secor on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance jim metzler the embezzling yuppie is very unbelievable as the novice revenge seeking adversary when jennifer rubin gives back the money she has carefully been concealing all credibility flies out the window and the guns pointing final showdown between secor and metzler is beyond ridiculous avoid delusion unless you are delusional enough to believe the misguided positive reviews here merk
<START> the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by ito the series' star would complete the series in the fourth installment grudge song directed by the capable who also directed in the excellent stray cat rock sex hunter the original female prisoner 701 scorpion is one of my all time favorites the sequel jailhouse 41 is nearly as good it's generally considered the best of the series and i might agree i think if it ever gets a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my opinion is nearly as good as it's much slower much more contemplative it has its share of violence and nastiness but there's more focus on the story and the characters eludes detectives in the first scene she is handcuffed to one and his arm off Â and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed and hooks up with a freelance prostitute yuki yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofy looking madame with a cage full of pet crows what really surprised me is how sad the movie is story which is never resolved it heartbreaking the images are startling and direction is masterful it's too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the series this is an awesome film
<START> this movie had an interesting enough plot about clones and organ usage but it fails as the lead actor is so annoying and whiny you want him dead not that anyone else is very good in it either but when you hate the character that is supposed to be garnering your sympathy the movie just fails to work funny enough it looks like a movie is coming out in the near future that has a plot that mirrors this one with more action and a better cast still though i won't be able to think of anything else but this film if i were to watch it this movie has a super dumb clone that is somehow smart enough to figure something is wrong with his camp where people bicycle at one mile per hour and wrestle for no reason the counselors tell them that when they are ready they go to america but our hero has his doubts so he snoops around and learns the awful truth which sends him on the run from the bad guys who shoot and hit the guy repeatedly he goes on the look out for the man he was cloned from peter graves is in it and so is dick but they add nothing to this movie which looks like something that was made for television on the plus side though when the island comes out the makers of this film can proudly say we thought of it first
<START> this blake edwards film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy a drama or a musical no matter the sheer presence of julie andrews is reason enough to see this comedy drama musical spy spoof julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film rock hudson looks tired but he's is more than fine as julie's romantic interest authentic world war i cars and planes add to the appeal overall the film is very entertaining the dvd release is an edited by blake edwards version of the original release supposedly this is the only version that edwards would allow but turner classic movies has shown the complete theatrical release version recently recommended
<START> we were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here well we got it home and could not believe what we saw its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor the main character is all over the place one moment he is like an immature little kid the next moment he is mature and intelligent then heroic then a perverted stalker br br the worst part is all of the out of place sexual content i have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy but this is just presented in a way that is creepy nipple slips close ups of a girls crotch many times in white panties or a swimsuit it was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters br br we were expecting something of a mature nature but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue if you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and this is for you if you are looking for something beyond that this movie was empty the characters and dialogue were just plain irritating br br
<START> this film is the one which you fall in love with alfred hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time the most influential aspects about his films are sheer simplicity gripping drama the another best thing about hitchcock's films is a definite gripping end br br any thing said about the man who knew too much is less the cinematography acting dialogs camera works are magnificent in this movie the song que sera sera at the end shall remain in our memories for life time the film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends rarely would hitchcock include humor in his films this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie br br this film is absolutely brilliant as good as vertigo
<START> this picture is a bad and blown up rip off of the michael short film extinct from 1995 while michael idea was original and perfect for a short film setting a sound of plot was poorly adapted from story and not fit for a full length feature film one would expect from a major hollywod studio the tragic flooding situation that ruined the sets in prague was just one bad link in a long rusty film production chain in this case for a studio to release such a product it is a shame especially for warner brothers a studio which broke new effects grounds with shows like babylon 5 in 1993 on television visual effects for television shows pioneering cgi in episodic television in the mid nineties were way more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this picture in cases like this sad as it may be can the film
<START> this is one of the more unromantic movies i have ever seen br br casting richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself supporting cast not too memorable br br story the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting the story is weak not enough happens to make a movie about there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here br br the setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive br br not destined to be a great one to remember
<START> this is my favorite movie of all time i just love all the trouble all the teams get into its great michael j fox looked so young but then again i guess he was br br the teams are so stereotypical you just have to laugh
<START> i had the funny chance of seeing this on mystery science theater 3000 four years ago i must admit it wasn't as badly done as some other science fiction horror movies of the time the plot revolved around an astronaut that came back to earth with alien inside of him now the plot is quite weird well if you can even call that a plot seeing a space program run out of one building and an old pickup truck is drop dead funny i'll admit it was horrible by today's standards and 20 years ago but i can see myself 43 years ago watching and being charmed by this movie it's not even close to the badness of invasion of the neptune men manos hands of fate or future war br br
<START> imagine diane from cheers the self centered over character now imagine she was trying to make a film movie this would be it if you just looked at some of the shots without any sound you would think hmmm this could be a good film br br now if you turn on the sound and listen for anytime at all you quickly realize that the person that made the film knows nothing about films beyond what they read in a book i was continually thinking is this thing a foreign film it was that bad br br if you don't remember cheers then think of mr beans holiday remember the defoe character that made the horrible movie well imagine that horrible movie without mr bean saving it that is what this movie is i'm not saying anything about what the movie is other than it is an attempt to make a dark moody film about a hit man going back home at least that's about all i could get out of it
