<START> i rented this dvd because i'm a big science fiction fan but this thing i won't call it a film because it was obviously shot very quickly on video seemed like they made it up as they went along i'm still not sure what it was about there's these guys dressed up in some weird s m outfits and i guess they're from another planet anyway not much makes sense in this low low low budget film if it was their first film i'd cut them some slack but i think it's like their 5th film and it's really really bad br br very bad acting not one good actor is this movie this director must have been out of his mind to even work on a horrible film like this don't waste your time or money on this dvd please people don't it is not even worth the 99 cents i paid to rent the dvd in fact i'm going to tell them the dvd was messed up to get my money back i don't believe in giving anything at all a bad review but i must here my advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship please find another profession to get into how could you make a rotten movie like this i would give this negative stars if possible it's that terrible
<START> 'it's supposed to have got good reviews' says the g f if so i can't find them she goes off to sleep and i endure michael douglas as a good ol' boy now there's a new one matt dillon all screwed up john goodman losing his cool paul reiser running around in bdsm leather oh it's a riot all right br br the hitch is you're probably going to lose interest pretty soon on liv tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain she might not have the register for her part but it's immaterial this movie is not about character development in fact i'd go so far as to say there's no character at all what you're supposed to appreciate here is the plot br br no one is 'bad' in this movie some people wonder why all these 'stars' even in here for goodness sake sign up for such a junky project odds are they thought it would be fun maybe they did have fun who knows hey maybe they got paid good too br br but you have to fork over money one way or another to see this turkey and that's probably not a good idea
<START> the film opens in a stuffy british men's club full of gents in leather chairs smoking cigars this is world a messenger delivers a small box to him which he opens to find a pair of gold earrings the site of the earrings sets off a reminiscence about the time he spent in the company of gypsies the rest of the film is flashback br br golden earrings has been a long time favorite of mine and is probably the most romantic movie i know dietrich plays against her usual type here she's dark haired earthy and not in the least bit mysterious instead of a femme fatale tower of strength and energetically sets out to use all her resources to help survive and reach his goal to make sure that he's a really convincing gypsy she pierces his ears and has him wear her dead lover's golden earrings with his clothes and some grease she transforms him from an effete british gentleman into a wild and sexy looking man br br when i was growing up i used to hear the song golden earrings which is sung in the film i think the tune is a little by dietrich there's a story the gypsies know is true that when your love wears golden earrings she belongs to you
<START> a clever and bizarre angle to beauty is in the eye of the beholder at times you think this is campy and over the top but the underlying poetic soul comes across strong and believable thanks to the performances of the two leads one worth tracking down
<START> i was given this film by my uncle who had got it free with a dvd magazine its easy to see why he was so keen to get rid of it now i understand that this is a b movie and that it doesn't have the same size budget as bigger films but surely they could have spent their money in a better way than making this garbage there are some fairly good performances namely jack beth and hawks but others are ridiculously bad droid for example this film also contains the worst fight scene i have ever seen the amount of nudity in the film did make it seem more like a porn film than a sci fi movie at times br br in conclusion awful film
<START> this has been edited for space br br chan wook park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify nominally a horror movie the central character is a vampire the film actually has elements of comedy theology melodrama cultural invasion and its analog of viral invasion of a body romance and few other things as well it's a film that has almost too much on its mind the film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic european literature in this case emile zola's it's an odd mix that doesn't always gel but none the less has an incredible power here it is almost 24 hours since i saw the film at lincoln center with a post film discussion by the director and i find my cage is increasingly rattled its not so much what happens is bothersome its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect br br the plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood its not explained he actually survives hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick unfortunately all is not well the priest finds that he needs blood to survive he also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire and its no not possible for him to go out during the day things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family the priest some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend from there it all goes sideways br br an ever changing film this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was it's a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways br br the film has enough going on that one could and people probably will write books discussing the film br br the two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance the vampire part of the tale is brilliant there is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the affliction that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside sitting in the theater last night i found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked i think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life it's contrasted with what happens later it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn't going to work its not the dark world of twilight or lost boys rather its something else i personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible the sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool the romance is also wonderfully handled sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done but it's the other stuff the looks the talk the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special i love the looks the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected and the mad passion of possible consummation this is one of the great screen romances of all time it perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love and lust if you've ever loved deeply i'm guessing you'll find some part of your hear on screen i know i did the statement i just wanted to spend eternity with you has a sad poignancy to it it's both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion the tragic romance will break your heart br br i won't lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great its not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great especially the actors who i have unjustly failed to hail as amazing the whole doesn't always come together the various genres thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other frequently i was wondering where the film was going i hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly br br i liked the film a great deal i loved the pieces more than the film as a whole its been around in my head since i saw it and i'm guessing that it will do so for several days more like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward one of the meatiest and most filling films of the year
<START> mr carlin left our common forum in june of 2008 shortly after going to the hospital for pains in the chest he had a history of heart trouble the media and comics everywhere covered the loss more than i or he would have ever expected but he was the grandfather of observational comedy br br this recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the prospects of life thereafter filming of the project occurred shortly after his birthday which he was happy to have attained observed i have followed carlin's career from the days of fuzzy black and white television and enjoyed his topical record albums br br it is a privilege for any carlin fan to at least see if not own a copy of this particular show he was still fast moving and with great timing even at 70 as he would say he is not smiling down from heaven on you if he's doing anything at all it's not taking harp lessons perhaps he's looking up
<START> a very bizarre bringing to the screen of william shakespeare's tragic love story br br the que family and the capulet family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence the hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy in the middle of all of this insanity are tromeo and juliet literature's most famous star crossed lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs to br br the film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original or close to original lines but the infamous troma bizarreness pervades the film from beginning to end that makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes but it is nonetheless pretty inventive tyrone tybalt in shakespeare has a particularly funny death scene 7 10 br br many differently edited and rated versions exist each contains violence profanity drug use and sex all with a big dose of bizarreness
<START> did the writers pay people to come up here and write positive reviews i mean really it's a bit hackneyed and spike isn't that funny he seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny there are so many mediocre gigs in this show like once the opening sketch was talk show apply directly to the forehead over and over and another that featured spike and another dude getting high and it wasn't even funny they didn't even do anything but sit around and laugh over and over ha ha and another that featured spike talking to a korean guy who ate duck and told him that he had a pet duck ha ha i mean really spike just gets funny guests on his show that's why people like this show
<START> i live in rome where the turkish director of this film lives and works from my italian friends i have heard many good things about his films so after seeing the preview i really wanted to see i am deeply disappointed one of the most pompous pseudo religious highly improbable and naive films i love film but this one is really heavy and bad the main character is really crazy and should be locked up in a madhouse made me sympathise with the negative character of an aunt who runs a dirty dealing company that only wants to make money and i consider myself an anti capitalist that bad
<START> do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of any sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour is there even just a single genuinely funny parody film anymore all i see are zero quality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera these movies are not funny they're not clever they're not entertaining they're just useless in every conceivable way br br the comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself sports movie it's the same thing though there are a few different writers for these films the wayans did some and seltzer did some others and i'm sure there's another pair i can't even tell the difference in direction or humour to be honest it all seems like the same people wrote and directed them i can't tell if the comebacks was done by the people who did scary movie or the guys who did epic movie or someone else it's just the same jokes from all the others br br if you have any shred of taste or value for humour don't see this movie if you have self worth don't bother seeing it if you have any respect for film making don't even consider watching it don't see it in any broke down derelict theatre that may still carry it don't rent it don't order it on netflix or pay per view don't it and don't even watch it for free on od avoid it like the plague br br the only conceivable reasons i can see to watch this film are as follows br br a masochism if you like torturing yourself there's very few better ways b seeing a prime example of why to avoid anything that says fox atomic c you're being paid considerably high amounts of cash br br i really would not watch the entire thing if someone offered me 100 to do it it's just mindless mental collapsing torment br br you might as well watch
<START> the monkees head is one of those peculiar phenomenons i've noticed that when something doesn't make sense people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings which its creator never intended such is the case here br br the movie is a stream of consciousness spectacle of the monkees floating in and out of various sketches blackouts set pieces etc similar to the ones on their tv show but while the tv show was played for laughs this doesn't seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep trippy pseudo intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes all in all it's the monkees doing the same schtick but now it's consciousness raising because the laugh track is removed there is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing it just drones on with colored lights br br the music in head should prove to anyone beyond the shadow of a doubt that the monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability the tunes are mostly garbage the only one that's even listenable is song which opens and closes the film but the thing is that was a gerry carole king song and while it's above average for the monkees it's below average by and king standards it's like hearing one of the old peter and gordon songs that paul mccartney wrote for them you might think it's a pretty good song but then you find out who composed it and you realize it's a throwaway mike nesmith's song is maybe passable the rest is worthless davy jones has i guess what the filmmakers imagined to be the big number in the picture since it's the only song presented as show biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence but it falls flat too just because the song isn't any good br br i have to admit i always liked the monkees so the movie is a real disappointment sure they were cheesy but they were so cheerful about it br br they knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it but then they got ambitious in head they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product but the truth is they wanted something more they wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists maybe not like the beatles but something approaching that head proves that they failed on all counts 1 out of 4
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film i had read the book a good ten years ago and was intrigued about how it would translate to film br br the screenplay is very true to the book which i was charmed by this is a rarity in itself these days the characterisations were solid and believeable and the kept me shifting in my perceptions even though i already knew the ending from the book br br an intelligent and well crafted film
