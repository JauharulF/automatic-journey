<START> i thought godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until i saw this monstrosity my friends and i went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie we could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created we decided to look in the low budget horror section we looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women we finally decided on last slumber party the whoops we made a mistake it seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in k mart the actors were picked up at a salvation army and as for steven tyler we will just leave that to the imagination the plot of this movie was ridiculous spoiler alert while watching the movie there is absolutely no closure at all then come to find out all the events were just a dream this movie should also have been about 30 minutes if all the camera zooms on still shots and scans of walls were taken out it would have been much shorter all i can say is i'm glad there wasnt a sequel
<START> the inspiration for the naked gun movies casts leslie nielsen who had only recently started doing comedy as the incompetent but heroic frank always having to solve an absurd case like airplane and the movies based on the series the humor relies on mel brooks style spot gags and silly comments namely the yes it is remarks along with the fact that nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him and of course the final frame in which something keeps moving br br it's too bad that the show only had six episodes at least it spawned the movies you can't go wrong with leslie nielsen in these sorts of roles i suspect that they all had fun filming it really funny br br before airplane leslie nielsen had starred in movies like forbidden planet harlow and the poseidon adventure as late as 1987 he co starred in nuts alongside barbra streisand and richard dreyfuss but since the first naked gun movie it's been all comedy all the time
<START> despite the potentially fascinating premise series 7 is weak attempt at attacking reality television aside from its bargain basement production values which present an eyesore 10 minutes in the overall tone of the film is misguided several reviewers have attacked the acting in the film but i think the real problem is this lame attempt to make the film into a farce aside from the fact that the jokes are not funny a pregnant woman swears a lot a young girl gets a bunch of guns it doesn't gel with the overall tone of the film had the makers actually made series 7 to bear a striking resemblance to actual reality tv colorful yet hollow edits lame sound effects sweeping camera motions maybe their point would have been more solid or at least more palatable instead series 7 meanders through the already harried world of death and game show you can just imagine the director slapping himself on the back for stating the obvious
<START> this movie is too stupid for words even if you consider it to be a parody on movie making if you consider it to be completely camp even than you're wasting your time watching it for you've seen it a hundred times before but maybe you are a big fan of high shrieking girl voices you're still loving barbie and ken and you can stand this typical '80s electric guitar background noise well than you'll have a chance
<START> i too saw this movie when it first came out i was a teenager at the time and i saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife i remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds the cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly the boy was a little much but the girl character was very interesting i thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend i have not seen the movie since and i wander why it has gone to the wayside i would love to watch it again to see if it was as good as i remember the elton john sound track was excellent
<START> i don't understand all these bad reviews i believe this movie was one of the best in the puppet master series being made on a low budget one can comprehend why the special effects and acting were not spectacular but they were not completely horrible br br greg brought a lot of charisma to the role of andre toulon he has a lot of potential and i hope to see more of him soon and though the cinematography was not excellent and there was minimal violence and gore this film was a lot of fun i am a big puppet master fan and have grown to expect blood and gore from the films of this series but i can say that i was never bored through the entire course of watching retro puppet master so if you ever get an opportunity to see this movie don't automatically regard it as unworthy of your time give it a chance you might like it
<START> this is by far the most vapid idiotic insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air and this is coming from someone who remembers san pedro beach bums br br my wife loves watching reality shows and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a walk the end result was straight out of monty python's ministry of silly walks sketch i couldn't laugh hard enough br br and then there's the ubiquitous ms banks as in laughing all the way to the she has to be the most annoying self important woman on tv since rosie o'donnell left the view as if modeling was doing great things for mankind please i've never found her attractive and i don't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth br br someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women
<START> as much as i hated the movie that this series follows i can at least says that was amusing the animated series is quite possibly one of the worst things ever produced the animation is quite often inconsistent although it does stay consistently bad the shape of a characters face is even capable of drastically changing in the same shot the script and voice acting also leave something to be desired since most of the cast seems about as talented as the cast of a third grade drama play characters like and dj are so forced into stereotypes of their nationalities that episodes containing them are almost physically painful to watch not that the series isn't painful on a regular basis anyway episode plots seem to strive to reach new levels of lame with every turn and are so full of plot holes it amazes me they had time to show commercials truthfully it amazes me anyone wold pay to advertise during the show in addition to being a bad series it is an even worse adaptation of street fighter many of the characters maintain the failed adaptations from the movie examples include ken and ryu being idiot con men even though ken is supposed to be rich blanka being friend charlie and chun li being a reporter it takes talent to take something as bad as the movie and make it worse
<START> david tennant and sarah brilliant acting had me in tears as many of the scenes were so familiar to me my husband suffered a sub in 1977 and required a major operation which involved lifting his brain and plugging the leak like tricia i was naive enough to expect that he would return to being his former self after over 25 years of loving and caring for him he abandoned me without warning to go and live with a woman he hardly knew he then for and i am now going through a divorce i do hope the programme helped people to understand what it is like to cope with brain injury
<START> well i am a dancer so automatically i liked this film the only thing i didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as i thought there would be but i have to say the it was a good dance film i think there should be more songs too but it was a good film as i said before my rating 9 10
<START> i loved this film i have been waiting for this film to come out so i could see it i saw it opening night and loved it some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but i thought it was great the actors did great and it was scary and made me jump paris hilton did a great job for her first film everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role the set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made the two brothers did a great job and the death sense were great the killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them i can't wait until this film comes out to video so i can get it and see it over and over again the over view of my review is go see this film if you like films and you will not be sorry i loved this film i give this film a 10 out of 10 it rocks
<START> imagine you have just been on a plane for 18 hours you have been on a business trip to south africa you are a high paid professional you've lived in the us for 20 years you are in your thirties you have a wife a little boy and another baby on the way one thing even though you have a green card you are still egyptian on transit you are asked to come with 2 security guards next thing you know you are overpowered hooded and chained and after a brief but still reasonably civil interrogation you are to be rendered this is what happens to anwar el at the beginning of the movie his is a story of pain and literally torture it's one of several story lines one follows his wife's attempts to get more information one follows the cold bureaucrats behind the rendition another story deals with the family of the man who leads the interrogation of anwar el there are some other stories too and by the end they all neatly come together though the more famous actors like reese witherspoon as the distraught pregnant wife jake gyllenhaal as the cia rookie forced to watch the interrogation in northern africa and meryl streep as cia hotshot corine whitman it is really the more unknown actors that carry the story and give it it's heart for me the actor playing the unfortunate mr el omar was the heart and soul of this movie his portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done it's almost as if he was being tortured for real also israeli actor was very impressive as the part worried family man and part extremely cruel chief of torture hard to watch and not exactly fun but still very worthwhile
<START> most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on nazism and fascism made at the height of those success br br sadly in the final moments of the film chaplin abandons all pretense of making art not to mention comedy and switches completely to propaganda and not anti nazi propaganda either but some of the most mawkish and idiotic progressive propaganda ever to ooze out of hollywood br br never mind that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even capable of giving the speech we see him give delivered ironically with a disturbing wild eyed fanaticism such trivialities must not be permitted to interfere with the message
<START> in an industry dominated by men and in lack of products with a female mark on it is it always nice to see a film shown from the woman's point of view i would welcome more films from female writers and directors and i think lots of other women with me
<START> don't watch it here's a hint tune in to the last 5 minutes and you'll catch her in a bikini otherwise you'll just have to sit through the flick and endure her helium sucking voice view for screen time with the inexplicable aussie accents of the lost city of atlantis or wherever the heck she goes to to locate her missing father we now know why kathy pursued a non speaking career of modelling she couldn't have survived the death threats from those poor headache suffering victims who heard her voice for more than 30 seconds the rest of the story is some kind of weird poorly lit mad max mish mash
