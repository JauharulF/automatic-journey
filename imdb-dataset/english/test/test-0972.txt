<START> i saw this film at the new festival in new york it was by far the worst film there it's use of full frontal nudity and a wishy washy script and direction that neither commits to a re make of nor decides it's a neil labute flick left me feeling 'why would anyone ruin a perfectly good cast like this ' it lacks irony and fills the vacuum with sentiment which causes the times when the movie turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face as your mind and heart search for what could be going on in the film but isn't i wish the director and editor had re edited the film because maybe there's more story there that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience
<START> cowboys and indians is an excellent film the writing acting directing could not have been better this was a story that begged to be told and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so stories like this one are not pleasant ones but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world it is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed a film that can do that is a rare a special thing andrew is an excellent writer and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film br br thank you for telling this story br br ruby
<START> the mod squad gets started the formation of the without even bothering to develop any of the characters or show us why anyone is doing what they are doing br br moreover most of the events in the movie seem ancillary to the plot without even a smack of character development the plot meanders from gen x club scenes to action scenes and back again br br
<START> journey through the final days of liberally sprinkled with flashbacks to a sexually active and diverse childhood br br it's definitely not a feel good romance movie it is a romance movie but one without illusions everyone's an adult here not your cup of tea if you want another sleepless in seattle or notting hill
<START> it couldn't have come out at a worse time just as the nation was entering the reagan years the boom boom 80s the time of no regrets no concerns it got no word of mouth and opened poorly the studio ditched it but hair is possibly the best musical ever made with forman directing and choreographing it's a startlingly beautiful well acted well written triumph that few people remember the casting is perfect the musical numbers unforgettable and even the downer of an ending doesn't diminish the film's indomitable spirit br br if you haven't see this movie you haven't seen the best musical of all time seriously
<START> it's important to check your expectations when you see hatchet the buzz that has been generated on this site far surpasses the real impact of the movie what may help someone about to see the movie is to realize that it is not supposed to be scary it is pure camp and an attempt at fun it is not funny just campy don't expect something like shaun of the dead nor something like friday the 13th part ii through infinity br br hatchet does possess passable actors the cinematography is straight ed wood creature effects and make up are silly probably on purpose gore and blood is something between romero and dead alive hatchet is a movie of it's between shaun of the dead and leslie vernon it's between campy and comedy there's a difference it's between ultra violent and violent comic book br br instead of capturing the essence of american horror or whatever other silly jargon that has been used to describe the movie it tries to capture something between seminal american horror like friday the 13th and new horror like shaun it thankfully stays away from torture horror br br in the end hatchet is between a bad movie and a decent movie br br i think it is happening more and more that people involved in movies are flocking to sites like imdb to rate and comment on the movies that they are involved with at very least there is campaigning going on for people associated with the associates to leave positive feedback and ratings there is no other reason for this movie to have stared out in the high with 600 votes and quickly fall after wide release this movie is on just better than the horrorfest releases and should not be so bloated
<START> this thing directed by french sensation patrick sebastien is worst than all the turkeys that you may have seen forget independence day kazaam the patriot etc you get the picture this one's the pits sebastien is a tv celebrity in france if you need an equivalent let's say he's jerry springer with an i q of 13 this is his first movie let's hope it's the last i hope troma or someone would distribute this film in the states so that you guys out there can the french stench at it's worst let's cut this short this is the masterpiece of s t
<START> anyone who correctly identifies the opening images as god killing himself without reading the end credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a rest home in transylvania i would imagine this as being a favorite movie at twin peaks dark lodge on movie night if time existed there i would think that a better title might have been how much fun can you have with someone who's almost dead in the forest with only neolithic technology the answer it would seem is quite a bit so despite the silly god killing himself the uber pretentiousness an apt phrase taken from a previous letter the more clearly alistair crowley hi i'm the beast deal with it than christian i can't believe another viewer had the thick headedness to see the judeo christian bible in this despite all of that this is a daring important work that most people should not see i am both impressed and creeped out that it was made at all
<START> scooby doo and the monster of mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern scooby doo animated features loch ness monster is a considerable improvement br br this time the gang head off to scotland to see the highland games and visit blake castle daphne's ancestral home and wouldn't you know the castle happens to be in the 'quaint' fishing village of on the shores of loch ness br br during their stay they meet a few interesting folks first there is fiona a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the loch ness monster br br sir ian the boss of the national heritage museum of scotland he is staunch non believer of br br the the own a cozy inn on the shores of the loch the sons are a couple of local jokers always into mischief br br del a wild paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her br br and finally duncan the dock master who has seen too many times to count br br most of these characters are stereotypes which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression however if you can immune yourself to it you'll be alright being from scotland i can't help but wince at the awfully mimicked scottish accents fact we don't sound like that br br soon enough looking rather more demonic than shows up and causes havoc looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands the usual chase scenes clues and shaggy's wacky disguises follow there are plenty of laughs the animation is splendid with some atmospheric scenes and locations and the plot a lot better than monster of mexico br br the only bad thing this time around is the music i miss louis scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too where are the hex girls when you need 'em br br the region 2 dvd is in crystal clear 1 78 1 anamorphic widescreen the region 1 ain't with dolby 5 0 sound some okay extras are included definitely worth getting
<START> a film like crossfire puts another film that spreads around its social consciousness i e the recent film crash almost to shame not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of intolerance is rotten more significantly although i'd wager crash throws the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this but because of how the storytelling and contrivances never get much in the way like with crash maybe it's not really necessary to compare the two as crossfire is in its core all deep into the film noir vein like its going out of style it was interesting actually to see what the director edward said on the dvd interview where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower on purpose so that more could be spent on the actors and the schedule went through at a very brisk quick pace but then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting set ups that it took a lot to do just for a small scene like when robert mitchum's first goes in for questioning under the captain robert young the contrasts of shadows seamlessly in the room is exquisite that there are many other lighting set ups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell the bars silhouetted against them and see what i mean br br but back to the substance part of the film it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery but one that we as the audience don't take long to figure on the answer it's then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that wouldn't be found in a common crime picture then as there are really no 'criminals' for the most part in the film there's a very calculated risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the worthwhile message against anti semitism but direction of his top shelf cast along with a really terrific script by john paxton fleshes out the characters least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message and what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it mitchum helps that along even in scenes like between him and young where its very much based in the situation of the story's moment i e a detail in the plot by injecting a little sly wit into some of the dialog it may already be there in the lines but he helps make the character with a good edge for his scenes br br then there's also robert ryan who excels at montgomery as a man who you know you don't like much at first just through his b s demeanor but you're not totally sure about either then once it starts to come clearer ironically through a subjective view point of the suspect mitchell george cooper at the apartment of the soon to be deceased his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blind way it's a good performance when also countered with cooper who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility it's really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this however and while you're watching the film it's more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes and in the sometimes stark overpowering camera moves on the actors so the message is in a way secondary not that it isn't an important one especially for the time period coming right off of ww2 but years later its seeing the actors even the ones that don't get the big marquee status like gloria grahame as ginny the femme fatale of the picture if it could've had time for one which it doesn't and william phipps as leroy the hick working off one another that sticks much strongly in the compacted screenplay br br is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too as for very long stretches we hear nothing and mostly when it does come up it's incidental to the character's surroundings he could've just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis most specifically the opening audience grabber into the film by sticking clear of that and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast it standards in genre material to a very fine memorable level my favorite scene would probably go to story about an irish immigrant he tells to leroy where all such elements come into place well it might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs and i'd still throw down murder my sweet as the director's masterpiece in this kind of picture but it's assuredly higher in quality than something of the b level too
<START> a film is beyond all expectations an excellent insight into the human condition what exactly drives mila to have her ass painted what could push a human so far that there only way to escape is to have there rear passage repeatedly painted by strangers br br this film is not afraid to stair in the face of the ass painting issue simply breathtaking roll on the sequel or whatever comes next from the geniuses who made this
<START> i guess they reward idiocy today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on sight br br this is a morons delight the worst stereo types of every ghetto and high school movie is dragged out twisted around and made even more unbearable every character in this movie has a sob story beyond sympathy lets pray for a remake where the whole school gets nuked br br spoiler how does a school so run down have the internet in the first place
<START> i really like this movie i like it not just because it's a great early 80s movie with a great soundtrack but i found that it has some thought provoking moments they are just moments not the entire film it's definitely not like less than zero br br the scenes deal with typical peer pressure and also with more difficult problems like the betrayal of trust these problems are not easily resolved or forgotten by the characters certain scenes will stand out and invite reflection on one's own teenage experiences and how those experiences may have affected one's character and outlook as an adult br br you can watch this movie and think about the problems young adults must face and about your own experiences or you can just pay attention to the boys' quest to de themselves either way it's a good movie
<START> utterly ridiculous movie which makes fun of the college admission process while it is true that the sat's is not everything in evaluating a student for admission to college what the movie talks about is utterly ridiculous and not worth repeating nor viewing br br college officials are made to look like stupid people who have an extremely narrow view of the entire process the film is an insult to hard working high school students who work hard and then have to suffer through a long process until they receive that letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they have applied for br br this movie certainly deserves rejection on all levels
