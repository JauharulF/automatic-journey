<START> i don't really know what it is about dirty dancing there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie i cannot possibly recount the hundreds yes hundreds of times i've watched it beginning to end but every time i do come upon it on tv i am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there i am for two hours loving the movie as if i'm watching it for the first time although patrick swayze and jennifer grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more to see this passion and commitment and i can't help tearing up a tiny bit at the end when patrick comes up to the houseman family and tells her dad nobody puts baby in a corner classic moment for all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy maybe in a way it is but it was the of the 80's films and put patrick swayze right on the map his performance was immaculate br br three cheers for dirty dancing br br ps the soundtrack is fantastic an absolute masterpiece
<START> this is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account let's filter the more judgmental ok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent low budget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost 100 accurate dramatization of dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isn't a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer 2001 was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a past tense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmer's psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isn't anyone's fault but dahmer's that 17 people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you don't see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesn't look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmer's death in 1994 due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior that's about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as i've stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but it's not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of america's most remembered serial killers i think it's safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer
<START> i rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on or the movie itself purely based on the chance that it's one of those rare overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy br br unfortunately this is not one of those movies i am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality or worse deliberate agenda but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse it is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to cope with the difficult realities of their life that is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it br br here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the us in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men and when i say evil i mean evil all white people in this movie are sinful racist sadistic abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants it would be a sad story if it wasn't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious br br the portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction the immigrants are saintly clean and could serve as ointment for boo boos and the world over i couldn't help but laugh when i saw these field workers presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiseled hair cuts from a top notch hair salon a little restraint and a more unbiased hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie evoking some intended emotion rather than sarcastic snickers
<START> ok from the point of view of an american who i assume do not know much about rugby this would be an amazing film for them first of all its got heart good morals the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy however to us where i come from rugby is the number one sport it is a way of life it is a game played only by the bravest and the victorious are hailed like heroes as though americans do for their baseball basketball stars am not really sure if it was the cheap budget or the maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan my whole life i can see than some of the actors didn't even knew rugby existed before acting in this movie in summing up to me this movie was terrible if you watch it and thought it was great please make time to go online and maybe google all blacks this is new zealand's national team and the ones who made the famous believe me they will make the highlands boys look like school girls
<START> horses on mars is an engaging animated short that takes a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those yet to evolve the story is personal and at times sentimental and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that involves the viewer in this science fiction story i was fortunate enough to view this short in widescreen format at the 2002 sundance film festival and must suppose that when transferred to the small screen it will lose some of its ability to draw the reader into the no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics
<START> although credit should have been given to dr for stealing the story line of horton hatches the egg this was a fine film it touched both the emotions and the intellect due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old justin henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character and each one's predicament the thought provoking elements linger long after the tear jerking ones are over overall superior acting from a solid cast excellent directing and a very powerful script the right touches of humor throughout help keep a heavy subject from becoming tedious or difficult to sit through lastly this film stands the test of time and seems in no way dated decades after it was released
<START> in 1970 feminists invaded the 'miss world' beauty contest in london and brought the occasion to a halt by pelting the stage with flour and eggs why because rightly or wrongly they felt the event to be demeaning and degrading to women i offer no criticism of their actions its a free world we live in what i want to know is why don't their modern day equivalents invade the studios where shows such as this are made and do likewise br br 'sex the city' is all about four self absorbed women from new york carrie is a slave to fashion who turns into a pussycat when a man so much as eyes on her charlotte yearns to find the perfect man they don't exist love so she can use sex to ensnare the poor devil lawyer miranda scares men away by nonsense like 'out of touch with my emotions' and lastly we have samantha the living embodiment of the old martini ad anyplace feminists hold up these characters particularly samantha as a shining example of modern day womanhood well if shouting rude words in busy restaurants is progress i think the feminists should take a long hard look at themselves and what they're supposed to represent br br had 'sex the city' been the creation of a man it would have been pulled from the airwaves for being sexist instead like 'charlie's angels' before it it has conned supposedly intelligent women into thinking it has acted as a positive force for good there's something very clinical and cold blooded about the show 'the benny hill show' was sexist too but at least it was funny
<START> for a good take on the roman empire watch the excellent bbc produced miniseries i claudius this just sucked the acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera hans matheson was irritating cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated viewings even caligula was tame i think this film was silently supported by religious groups who shall remain nameless the overt tones of christian favoritism and persecution were blatant if that gives any hint stay away what ever you do the running time is so long that i was able to read harry potter's first book faster than the time it took to view this tripe br br italy has done better don't let hans cute face fool you he is not a great actor he is a great bore
<START> to be honest fellow imdb reviewers i enjoyed this show a lot the reason well it didn't try to be more than it is i mean a sitcom with regular expectations with a well known and repeated plot funny and talented actors and clever jokes oriented for a post college audience br br this is what grown ups is all about trying to be mature but in a funny way br br white is funny as always and delivers some witty and hilarious sex oriented jokes the humor is very 90's without taking in account the tendencies of the new millennium and that's the main reason in my opinion why the show didn't have success it got stuck in the 90's br br oh and mrs ribisi was really funny and perky br br my favorite show has to be the one that deals with karma biting the ass not a cult classic but i'm sure it's part of regular early 2000's nostalgia
<START> in victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and they are sent to live in the country the children adapt to their new situation make friends and enlist the help of a kind old man they wave to on the train to help reunite their family br br actors who direct movies are often not very good at it jeffries however the great veteran actor of dozens of british comedy classics is one of the few exceptions his brilliant conception he also wrote the script from the novel by e of a classic british children's story is what raises this film to art whilst the story may be highly idealised the wonderful performances and the fabulously evocative yorkshire dales settings combine to make a truly memorable movie the photography by arthur is the definition of good movie making not a shot is wasted in telling the story but at the same time the images combine to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere agutter is simply perfect as the kind hearted bobbie okay i fell in love with her at an early age but i defy anyone to disagree and cribbins whose comic acting pedigree is on a par with jeffries is unforgettable as perks the humble yet proud railway porter this is a film out of time romantic charming hugely enjoyable and with a beautifully naive sense of good hearted kindness towards all
<START> the dog can act unfortunately nobody else in the cast of this sordid faux children's film can a stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two children much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold hearted father in what can only be described as dickensian the evil widower forbids his children who may or may not be mentally challenged from playing with benji neither the children nor benji obeys soon the children are kidnapped and benji has to help the police find them it's only then that the old man realizes that benji is good not bad br br tom lester whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim witted eb on green acres plays one of the kidnappers so does the regrettably over utilized deborah previous screen triumphs include beach blanket bingo and the woeful it's a bikini world she also played both gidget and tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her good girl reputation by playing it bad br br stay away from benji he's a dog and this movie is a dog
<START> i chose the english patient for a history extra credit assignment i thought that this movie would be incredibly boring instead it has become one of my favorites it portrays life in wwii quite accurately and the love story is amazing the love story made the movie so incredible i felt this interesting feeling of passion or something it made me want to watch the movie over and over again kristin scott thomas and ralph fiennes are amazing actors and the way they played their characters is amazing the look wonderful together and actually seemed to be in love i recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to watch as a leisure activity or for an assignment
<START> an obvious vanity press for julie in her first movie with blake let's see where do we begin she is a traitor during a world war she redeems that by falling in love her friends who are presumably patriots because they are german citizens are expendable and must die and she winds up as a heroine ok the scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for french intelligence can't even be described and we won't even mention rock's romantic scenes with a female by the way when they visit a museum look at his gaze i it on video and it's priceless is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie i don't know and you won't either
<START> it is beyond me why two million danish people each week sit down to watch this terrible show the dialogue is terrible and not realistic the characters are hollow and simplistic there's a tough man a tough woman and a sensitive man the writers actually say that they have modeled the characters after greek mythology give me a break all the characters are of course brilliant policemen when i have watched this show i have longed for district hill street and nypd blue these are brilliant shows and is a lousy copy this program is a symptom of the disease danish television is currently suffering from
<START> i don't understand why everyone is hating on barney if you hate the show so much then don't watch it its stupid how everyone is changing the i love you son to i hate you if you don't like it fine whatever thats your opinion but there is no point to degrading the show when it isn't even that bad ok so its corny and yes it has its flaws but its a kids show kids don't want to be sad and miserable they want to be happy and barney helps that and even in the show there are moments of sadness and anger and etc and yes barney uses magic but the kids see barney as a figment of imagination kids need a place to escape to express themselves the world is a miserable and hard place we all need a place to express ourselves and be happier barney does this to us this show is great i watched barney when i was younger yes some people find it stupid but i watched it and i'm top of my class it might not necessarily make you smarter but that's not the point i believe that the point of barney is to provide a place where kids can be kids and the spirit of childhood can be expressed where imagination lives on so many teenagers now are unimaginative and are scared to express themselves barney helps encourage that barney helped me to not be afraid and to just show myself for who i am i'm a sophomore at high school now an ap student with a 4 0 a drama student with a love for theater and art and with a new baby cousin who loves barney i watch it with him and enjoy it and sing along with it yes its corny and silly and whatever but its great for kids who wants to be an adult who doesn't have time to have fun im a kid at heart and i love barney its great for kids and those who are a kid at heart br br its a great show for babies and toddlers so stop hating say that you don't like it but stop it with the dumbest show ever or a load of bull or whatever keep it to yourself take a chill pill or whatever here's something i never liked sesame street but you don't see me going grover is a load of bull or cookie monster should die or whatever i hate all of the t that people say about books or movies like barney or twilight if you hate it ok whatever no one cares don't go saying hate things about it cuz you might just offend someone
