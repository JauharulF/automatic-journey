<START> i don't care what anyone says this movie was crap the only thing it had going for it was camera work which was very well done as for the dialogue i have heard so many people talk about it sucked too yes it was honest and true to life but so what i can hear anyone talk like that on the street or in a fast food joint what made the dialogue good in movies like pulp fiction and gosford park was the fact that it is written dialogue that takes time to think through another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture i believe that the male character could have been a lot stronger but instead it seemed weak in fact the movie seemed to revolve around the male character and then he completely disappears in the last twenty minutes the girl in the film i found completely repulsive not in appearance but in her needy needy ways saying she is in love with a guy and actually getting jealous of him the next day what a crock of crap final thing the sound was terrible and i hope it was only something that plagued my theater instead of actually being on the final cut of the film there was a constant buzzing sound during several scenes and it was actually taking away from the talking going on the one good thing again was blood's job as the dp but the actress that played the main guy's ex girlfriend did a very good job as well these two things couldn't save an ultimately terrible movie which i refuse to call a film br br 2 10
<START> i just got home from seeing radio i've not seen such an inspiring story in a long time my kids are ages 8 and 5 and i would like to take them so that they may feel the message as i did you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are not judge them for their differences cuba gooding jr and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie i don't know why we can't have more movies like this rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis
<START> the problem with other actors cast in the of dorian gray is that they either looked too old for the part hurd hatfield helmut berger josh david gallagher ben barnes or that they were unable to pull off the english aristocratic manner without being stilted dorian is the perpetual 19 year old or so all milky skin and locks as described by wilde so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part i e who can portray the callousness and but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens and peter firth pulls it all off in this excellent british tv adaptation br br gielgud as henry while considerably older than what wilde had in mind does wonders with his scenes wilde's have never sounded so natural and unforced especially george sanders in the 1945 version was pretty feeble by comparison and his costume didn't fit br br finally jeremy bratt plays basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio again a fitting interpretation in general the film includes enough gay subtext without turning dorian himself gay he's all things to all people and supposedly there's no drug or sexual perversion he hasn't tried in the 18 years covered by the story but that makes him more than homosexual he seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here as he should according to the novel br br of course the budget of this production was not very large so everything feels a little stagey particularly encounter with sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look also the final shot of dorian a puppet i suppose in his white toad like make up is more hilarious than convincing and death scene is inadvertently funny also as far as i recall basil should have been killed seated at the table br br but all in all this is a very worthy adaptation i'm sure wilde would have liked it the only thing missing is the sensual side not so much sex scenes but wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers luxurious cloths and precious gems isn't really explored here i e the aestheticism is completely missing but like i claudius the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values
<START> i don't know who financed it or why but this want to be vampire flick is really awful it tries to be hip and appeal to the young mtv generation audience but it is just downright laughable the acting is horrible and the directing is horrendous i heard the budget was 600 000 i want to know where all the money went
<START> how can this movie be described oh yeah i've got it wretched br br i'm not big on chop socky but this is just plain garbage anyone who would waste their money to pay to see it is just too sad for words
<START> i think josh is so great the rest of the show is fun to watch but i think it is the handsome and sexy josh that makes the show las vegas really fun to see in the days of magnum i loved tom selleck i thought he was the sexiest man on the face of the earth a hunk on a television show is a must in order for women to enjoy watching something especially just for purposes of innocuous entertainment i would have done anything to win a date with tad hamilton josh is incredible and i will always have a super crush on him josh is definitely a hunk and i will watch las vegas all the time josh is a big reason why too
<START> george zucco was like boris karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance the mad monster is no exception to that rule it is by all standards a poor if entertaining film the filmmakers obviously didn't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days still zucco is fine and believable as the mad scientist br br the film itself is enjoyable on a camp level normal horror movie fans for the most part won't take a liking to prc films however these poverty row productions have a small but loyal cult following occasionally they would rise above their limitations with detour being the best example of this usually they looked like this for all its technically poor qualities the mad monster is an amusing enough way to kill a rainy afternoon the dvd from retromedia is recommended as it pairs this with another prc production the black raven the original theatrical trailer and best of all an interview with glenn strange talking about his role in this movie 4 10
<START> yes it might be not historically accurate actually only 6 soldiers of 9th were killed there and yes it has some mistakes and exaggeration bended machine gun come on or the that history lesson about how afghanistan was never conquered by anyone educated russian officer would know history much better than that take for example british campaign in afghanistan and yes it does not have multi million dollars hollywood style special effects but it's strongest point in showing soldier's life there their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are being killed in front of their eyes in my opinion really does a good job showing all those things br br again movie has it weaknesses but in my opinion it appears to be one of the strongest russian movie for the past few years br br 8 10
<START> combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired with a script that the screen writers for touched by an angel might have passed up as being too ozpetek still keeps us interested at times in fact i wanted to focus on the positives but i found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that i think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones br br this movie is at heart pun intended a story built on a big twist style ending this kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like una or god awful garbage like the films of m night shyamalan falls somewhat closer to the latter i found the cinematography in general to be above average the tracking shots of irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mother's house for me the grotesque parody of michelangelo's when giancarlo comes in from the rain and irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch one big issue that i took exception to in this film was method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place this worked to fantastic effect in facing windows but when employed here it seems that is no in fact besides the ridiculous story the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of it's main character it made the final breakdown scene even more bad br br in this movie ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate driven societies by urging us to be more spiritual not necessarily religious and more altruistic and while i'm certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view i felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object could the characters have been anymore two dimensional i tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless was the evil aunt eleonora anything more than a caricature it goes for the people on the side of right too like the good aunt maria clara and the elderly doorman and just in case we might have missed point he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own br br this brings me to an interesting point about the director's use of color he clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black as well as irene when we first meet her and after her life conversion the evil aunt eleonora and of course the good but confused padre black is a color that suggests a definite course the mind is set and emotionless it is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor the business suit it is also the color of mourning such as the finery sported by the suicidal duo finally black is the color of piety such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that irene emulates in the second half of the film br br the other main color and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart is red it is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component the character who wears red is bold emotional receptive to new ideas and indulgent red is a risky color in modern times it challenges our perceptions of the and at the same time makes the vulnerable yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism as the earliest members of cro magnon man buried their dead in red and indeed the first man named in the torah adam is named after the hebrew word for red red also has an anachronistic flavor looking back on the past where red and by association a less self driven attitude towards life was more accepted so when we encounter the red filled room the mysterious covered walls complete with a red accented and a red painting of a whirling dervish of mother good characters maria clara and wearing resplendent outfits of red and finally the painting of mother in a formal red gown we can see where sympathies lie br br a word or two about the soundtrack i found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story the quasi baroque theme that signified irene was great for it's monotony and feeling of malaise the absolute best use of a constantly repeated baroque theme such a this would have to be in kubrick's barry lyndon with it's masterful repetitions of an 8 bar attributed to one absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while irene is chasing benny through the house it is of the famous aria ne from opera la wally the aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever as mother was a dramatic soprano we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter as in the movie irene is soon destined to never again see benny alive i just have one minor question of the soundtrack why include the famous tango yo soy maria i love the song and personally could hear it all the time but it didn't really fit here
<START> murder by numbers is a pretty good movie even though the plot rolls along at a snail's pace what with sandra bullock's character getting all mixed up with her partner and the movie flashing back to a previous trauma situation she had been in it does succeed in keeping the viewer involved in the film br br having said that i do think that it does a good job in setting that eerie sort of who done it type atmosphere it keeps you guessing at which one of the boys really was behind the murder if not both of them i think ryan gosling and that other kid lol do a good job of selling that bully versus dork relationship not sure about gosling playing a bad ass but for a guy who would later star in a movie like the notebook he did a pretty good job once the movie gets rolling though i really found myself involved in the story sort of asking myself oh my god what would i do if i were in that situation like i said a good csi type movie maybe not for the extreme crime drama movie junkie but a good all around flick br br 8 outta 10
<START> very stark very drab no real drama why not just make a documentary this isn't exactly the passion of joan of arc the only reason for seeing chronicles is to hear the performances i love bach's music and even i found it hard to sit through this misery of a film the great gustav plays in two senses of the word bach we don't get much of a sense of him as an actor since he's given so little to do dramatically mostly he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms bach's life of course was not an errol flynn movie it was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard this probably means that the life isn't a terrific candidate for a film the music of course is another story i recommend the stations of bach far more information for one thing and some insight into the music which is after all why bach interests us in the first place
<START> a minute to pray a second to die is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting storyline it is filmed beautifully with a relatively high production value for a film in this genre br br alex cord does a terrific job portraying clay mccord an outlaw who is suffering from increasingly debilitating seizures he is seeking amnesty before his enemies close in on him but is being too cocky for his own good when he asks for it robert ryan delivers the best performance in the film as the governor of new mexico mario and arthur kennedy are also great here br br this movie is very good but it doesn't stand out to me as being one of the best spaghetti westerns out there it's lacking too much in style to be in the same league as any of the great ones it does have some cool spaghetti overtones but overall it's a bit too much like an american western this is especially evident in the music score which is ok as movies go in general but pretty dull by euro western standards the soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from the unforgiven although there is an interesting story here it is told in a manner which is a bit too conventional for my tastes if a spaghetti western fan and a hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together this one would be the perfect compromise br br all of this is not to say that anyone should avoid this film i did enjoy watching it very much as i said it is a very well done film and i recommend it to anyone who likes westerns spaghetti or otherwise
<START> if this movie had a point i never discovered it a very depressing movie which supposedly is about the final evacuation of the residents living in a dam site area on the northfork river in montana the problem is that there is no actual northfork river in montana there are several north forks but they are branches of other rivers which divided into north and south forks br br the opening scene of the movie is a coffin bobbing to the surface of the lake but the scene is never tied into the story and the viewer is left to speculate as to its meaning but much is left to the viewer's speculation in the movie another example is when a team of dam employees responsible for the evacuation of the residents arrives at the dam headquarters another group of people are departing some remark which is almost inaudible is made about these people which makes no sense whatsoever and there is no followup in the movie to explain it br br the movie is butchered into several stories and the film keeps switching back and forth between stories which is quite disconcerting and the stories are weird in one of them the occupants of one property refuse to be evacuated because they are living in a home that is built like noah's ark br br another senseless story centers around a sick orphan who is dying and somehow he is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time if anyone can figure out what the ghost story was about the author must have explained it to them br br the scenery was stark and the sun never shines there are snowy mountains in the far distance i guess the purpose was to set the mood the time period is set by the fact that the all drove ford of the 1946 48 era although the events are supposed to have occurred in 1955 the acting was mediocre when i saw the billing for this movie it said that darryl hannah was in the picture if she was i didn't recognize her but i surmise that she was the ghost lady
<START> about this film was the title song after 30 minutes i discontinued watching because it was so lame bad story bad actors bad movie if you want to watch a good movie watch pulp fiction instead
<START> in this tale of a tightly wound christian family that has three of its four members born again after a cake caused car crash what really stands out is how grounded most of it is where there is so much potential to go over the top and how truly inspired most of the acting is where most of the film's moments particularly its frank and innocent discussions of sexuality after three of the four family members have their guilt and shame removed is hilarious it is also thought provoking and the characters stay with you br br how often for example does a character in a comedy spin from near caricature to full bodied emotional being in the course of one scene how often do we see a cast that can pull back from showboating mid sentence in order to show a bit of the humanity beneath the character's skin even many of the bad guys in this film have moments of heart breaking honesty even while much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrifying there is truth and history behind even the most questionable acts in this film which is a difficult task in satire br br how refreshing it is to see a darkish comedy that can dare to be humanistic how nice to see actors so fully committed to character that they can dare to let them be ridiculous and sublime br br and as a gay person i do not think i have ever been quite so touched by a heterosexual sex scene as i was by the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accident br br bravo bravo one of my favorites at this year
