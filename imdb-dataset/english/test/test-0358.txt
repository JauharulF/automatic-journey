<START> given the budget and the inexperience of everyone involved livin' tha life could have been worse jamal wants to be chris tucker whom i've always found very annoying as a previous commentator has noted but peanut edward d smith while some of his over reactions go on way too long a director's problem has some comparatively subtle and funny moments such as when he is trying to instruct jamal on the proper method of smoking a joint with a buddy throughout he is usually more poised and self possessed than jamal which could have been the germ of a nice exploration of the contrasts in the relationship but wasn't developed very far br br but the inexperience of the writer director cinematographer etc is no excuse for his inattention has he ever seen a movie faces are important has he ever heard of a closeup even ed wood could do a closeup i don't think it's much of a budget issue i could only give a general description of what any of the actors look like and not just because of no closeups but the lighting lights for outdoor shooting may cost too much but you can make a with pieces of paper that would have required moving the camera closer to keep the out of the shot helping to solve the closeup problem at the same time if that's too technical you can turn the actors around so they are not in shadow or you can expose for the shadows and if it hadn't been shot in l a i'd say take advantage of cloudy days it goes without saying that the movies this one steals from are all with the possible exception of weekend at bernie's better than this one but livin' tha life would have left a much better impression if it hadn't made the viewer squint all the way through just to catch a glimpse of whatever the human element might have been br br p s the scene in the barbershop is just stupid
<START> this movie quite literally does not have one redeeming feature the characters are one dimensional cliched incredibly misogynistic and stupid the script looks as if it was cobbled together from 100 other movies the acting is horrible and some of the 'gross out' humour made me feel nauseous br br shame on you gregory for thinking any of this would be funny or interesting br br the worst movie i've seen in several years
<START> this film is by far the worst film i have ever seen in my life a woman the ex pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex husband killing people for no reason in baths to achieve her goal the women i don't think ever went to acting college she just spends the whole film making stupid expressions and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera failing on most occasions she makes friends with her ex husband's wife and son she does this to use them against her husband at first when you watch this film you think that the ex wants to kill her ex husband maybe because he has treated her in a bad way but in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back the two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment using whips of course my advice to the general public is do not buy this film do not rent this film and do not watch it like i did at 1 on fox
<START> at first glance a film like northfork a town set to be flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters who are sent out to evacuate the remaining townspeople could be just an ordinary film as we soon meet a remaining priest taking care of a sick child a greedy land owner we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily digest however when one is first introduced to this film you notice the amazing wide open cinematography and a scene involving a church hall missing a wall that opens up to the pastures and scenic view of the mountains with cattle grazing it soon becomes clear that after this scene and a few of the towns peoples introduction that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story it is something very special and unique br br at first glance things are not as clear but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer is witness to is stunning and the characters that inhabit this small soon to be extinct area are just in word amazing it's what can either draw you in closer to this film or either have you bored sitting there waiting for something to happen br br the films deep spiritual and dream like qualities give it a slow and methodical approach which i am sure will bore some viewers but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture the film is great to witness br br rating 8 out of 10
<START> this film is slow this film is cheap this film makes friday the 13th look like a best picture nominee the acting is crap the special effects are crap no one dies for like 40 minutes and all the people do is act badly the only thing that saves it is it's ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity going on the funniest part is watching the heroine fight off the attacker she supposed to be trained but she fights like a 70 year old they spend pointless scenes on people who don't die and no scenes on people who do die to the point where you don't even know why they are dieing i love slashers but this is just crap
<START> in the early 00's production companies had a short lived craze for supernatural genre movies in france after the crimson rivers and brotherhood of the wolf turned out to be hits so several movies were green lit or saved from their direct to video fate however france as opposed to the us uk or italy has little tradition of fantasy b movies and it turned out quickly that bloody mallory or the crimson rivers sequel were ill advised attempts at recreating a kind of magic that had never existed in french cinema in the first place as they flopped producers have gone back to their usual fare derivative farces or the umpteenth self referential tribute to french new wave by a former critic from les cahiers du cinÃ©ma br br could only have been green lit during this short window as it serves no other discernible purpose it's your by the book slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references and you'll find bimboesque female characters a french university looking like a us campus and plot twists so lazy you don't even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before even before the movie started br br these elements make all the fun of a 70's or a 80's b movie and you expect them in a 70's or 80's movie however we're not in the 80's anymore and nobody warned director doug headline as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie headline himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early 80's but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes a bore br br when you put together clichÃ©s from a movie and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as wes craven or quentin tarantino you get a scream or a death proof movies that are imitations from old guilty pleasures but also magnify these clichÃ©s and add a great deal to them that's called talent and that's why you can't confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades ago br br takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements from past movies unfortunately for the male viewer the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing there are very strong similarities presumably unintentional between the plot of and the reviled halloween 3 season of the witch as both deal with supernatural druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt at taking over the world on halloween night as even the plot of halloween 3 makes more sense than this one it means that something seriously wrong went with
<START> gilmore girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm wit and charm at age 16 gilmore gave birth to rory gilmore she left her parents house and got a job now and rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy they are best friends the girls have an extensive knowledge of movies and tv shows and are constantly quoting them in the first season needs money to send rory to chilton a very highly rated high school so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents they are happy to give them the money but in exchange rory has to come have dinner with them every friday night i highly recommend this show i love it
<START> well br br first of all as many reviewers have pointed out this is a rip off of the martin cahill story first represented by the bbc and by the john boorman film the general which is a great film and far far superior to this one br br speaking as a native british person the supporting cast to kevin spacey was really good in terms of british and irish acting talent especially peter but it was totally wasted the characters were c p and as for kevin spacey didn't come across as a loveable rogue but as nothing really substantial or significant br br not a lot to redeem this film the best bits are the gags and tricks nicked from the other films it rips off compare notes on this film and the general i'd be interested to see what others think br br
<START> many people have said that this movie was not a good movie at a horror perspective i agree it was not very scary it did have some gruesome ways of torture yes hooks going where they shouldn't but not scary but it was a good movie at a comedic stand point i thought it was hilarious such bad acting from dee snider with his stupid theological questioning and every second word he said came out as what is define then the angry mob at his house with one of them holding a sign saying we're not gonna take it which is a song from his band twisted sister but i think the part that made me laugh the most was the one guy's wife that was dead and dee snider was holding her up and making her dance when i saw that i broke out in tears so i would not recommend this for avid horror lovers but for those who love horror for its comedy i recommend this movie 100
<START> i have seen films come and go in my years and when i see a disaster film i keep hoping i wont be disappointed and with this one i was not in the least the story of a whole country sinking into the ocean was a great concept written by a novelist with intense theories on where this earth is going the characters were top notch and even though i am not japanese i didn't need a translator to give the idea of how people in their most desperate needs can come together for the common good the special effects blew me away i was literally on the edge of my seat watching the tidal waves lava flows and land explosions that must have taken months of work to perfect as for the acting i thought yes this is acting at its best emotions run rampant throughout the film and i cried at the most severe scenes for movie goers alike you don't need to speak or understand japanese to watch this film you can get the idea and feeling from each person and character to understand it well and to follow it along like you are there my hats off to shinji higuchi for directing it i hope he can outdo his work with another mind blowing experience as i said fantastic film
<START> one of the best movies ever the idea of a double interpretation involves we all br br would be a schizophrenic or an e t no doubt in my opinion but let's keep the question open kevin spacey the big screen monster plays as it should be done let's not forget jeff bridges and his great psychiatric br br lastly a masterpiece that for itself can keep our eyes wide open from the beginning to the credits and our minds thinking even when the movie is over if you still didn't watch it go right now and again again
<START> i'm not going to go into too much depth but showtime was a pretty funny movie there wasn't any slapping your knee funny scenes that i can remember but it had it's moments the cast is pretty good robert de niro is good as usual and eddie murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance rene russo was just fine in the film no complaints there there were two characters in the story that i liked that they didn't explain much at all the first one was trey sellars' eddie murphy's buddy at the gym played by ken campbell i supposed he was just a friend of but i wanted to know more about him the other character that i liked was mitch preston's robert de niro's fellow cop partner played by nestor serrano i guess he was just another cop working with mitch preston but i wanted to know if he was his partner or what not i think maybe i'm putting too much thought into a movie i mean after all it's a comedy who cares about the characters i guess i do though i was really pleased to see this was directed by tom dey who also directed shanghai noon ever since i saw that movie i was looking forward to his next work i think he did a pretty good job with this film and i again look forward to his next work br br all in all it was a good movie but i wouldn't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you're a die hard robert de niro eddie murphy rene russo fan it was worth seeing in the theater but not for full price i'd recommend seeing it at matinee price br br also here's some movie trivia for ya the guy who played the camera man played by judah is the guy in the music video everyday by dave matthews band he was also the clerk in meet the parents also starring robert de niro and on top of that he also played derek brother in zoolander both zoolander and meet the parents star ben stiller just some useless trivia for ya br br i hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading br br chris
<START> this movie is awful at first i thought it may appeal to children due to the cuddly ewoks the fury little people from stars wars after sitting through this monstrosity of a movie i am certain that not even a 4 year old would find this movie interesting the special effects are by far the best of this movie and compare well for other 80ies tv movies the script is bad the actors especially miller and unbelievably bad and the flick is so predictable that i still can't believe i was able to not touch the forward button on my vcr however i came close to switching this mess off more than once
<START> their purple moment br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format silent br br black and white short film br br two luckless nightclub laurel and hardy are unable to pay their bill provoking violent retribution from a hot tempered waiter tiny sandford br br typical l h scenario less substantial than some of their best work from this period but worth a look nonetheless stan takes center stage this time round caught up in a financial dilemma after holding back part of his wages to fund a night on the town only to find out too late that his aggrieved wife fay has replaced his stash with worthless coupons some of the prolonged closeups of laurel as he slowly becomes aware of the unfolding disaster reveal his genius for characterization and mime 1920's morality is represented by patsy o'byrne playing a hatchet faced busy body who takes great joy in alerting l h's respective spouses and lyle to their husbands' bad behavior the ending fizzles but the movie still has much to recommend it directed by james
<START> after some further thought about this film i find it's far too easy to dismiss this as the boy's dream i have actually received some spiritual strength from northfork angels do exist we definitely are entertained by angels most of the time we aren't even aware of it at a point of spiritual and emotional in my life i personally really needed this film yes as i wrote before it speaks to so many can't wait to get to heaven br br being so sick of all of the fx and formula stuff i found this film to be genuine cinema all i can say is it touched me in so many ways that i still am sorting it all out north fork is a wonderful film one that brings the viewer's mind out of the gutter and into the heart the spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me pay attention as you'll need to use the brain and heart god gave you to follow the story i think it's possibly a bit over the heads of some but i feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly i want to view it several more times just so i can take it all in br br the industry needs to study this film to realize we do exist br br my thanks to all involved in the making of this film
