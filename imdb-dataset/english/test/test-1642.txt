<START> the girl in lovers lane is one strange little low budget film on its surface the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named brett halsey who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny lowell brown and the girl carrie joyce meadows that meets who would like to look out for him nothing overly interesting happens goes out with carrie gets danny out of trouble carrie's father drinks a lot etc until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when carrie is murdered her father blames pulls him out of a jail cell and just about beats him to death now their roles are reversed and danny has to save br br until i read the reviews on imdb i thought that maybe it was just me reading more into and danny's relationship than was really there but i see now that i'm not alone it was quite obvious to me early on that and danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959 the homosexual nature of their relationship while never openly expressed is still quite obvious their living and sleeping arrangements reaction to finding danny in bed with a prostitute inability to commit to carrie and that phone call at the end when danny tells his parents he's brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there's more to their relationship than initially meets the eye i'm sure they exist but i can't think of any movies i've seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this one br br as for the movie i don't know any other way to put this Â it's boring as i wrote earlier nothing much at all happens for 90 of the run time the characters are dull and the actors aren't good enough to give the girl in lovers lane much of a spark the lone exception is jack elam his crazy jesse is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching elam had creepy down pat but i guess the biggest problem i had with the movie was with character motivation and logic carrie is killed and is immediately blamed what about crazy jesse who has been stalking carrie for probably her whole life anyone think to ask jesse where he was that night her father has seen him bother carrie at the diner yet he never considers that the leering jesse might have something to do with his daughter's death not a lot of logic there and what about jesse's confession danny grabs jesse by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession out of jesse real tough guy huh why would he confess so easily and after he confesses no one thinks to grab him it's awfully nice of jesse just to stay put and not run off in any other reality he would have never spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder the fact that the girl in lovers lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something i'm not willing to do overall i'm giving the girl in lovers lane a 4 10
<START> to put it simply this was a pompous piece of canine poopie overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment after a while i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed up anal retentive br br and this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn't have all the scenes are in a sort of washed out blue steel hmmm the last time i checked candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors in fact the light they put out tends to be more in the yellowish orange range of the spectrum so where's all the blue steel grey light coming from br br this movie has fancy sets and glitzy cgi fx but it's still dreck it's pathetic junk put out for today's movie goers who are easily by pathetic junk br br i very much enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices but this was a total hack job br br universal studios' 1941 the wolfman is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what could be done nowadays br br i'm done with this franchise the first movie was reasonably decent the second still somewhat entertaining but this one i couldn't even finish all the way to the end because it was so boring
<START> okay it's 2005 and when you finally get to look at this film you will probably exclaim that it is dated but here's the thing the screenplay was bold the exposure of the music industry at that time was as bold as well and it took some time for this to get music that was created by african americans to be promoted on the same level as white acts in some cases it still is but back in the 70's this film addressed some of the background many never knew now we've got american idol pop idol and other such things that allow us into the minds of the record execs and how they think they should market something that sells and not market talent br br when i was a kid i loved the earth wind and fire release of that's the way of the world which contained some of their biggest hits shining star reasons and the title little did i know this was a soundtrack of a movie until i moved to los angeles and got the wonderful z channel br br the z channel showed this film as part of a harvey keitel retrospective gee i had no idea harvey keitel did so many movies and when i saw this one i was surprised this movie is not a cinematic masterpiece but it does deserve more merit than it got it's a nice little film more than a vanity piece for earth wind and fire harvey keitel does a great job as a torn record executive trying to fight the system there are a lot of lessons to be drawn from this and a lot of insider trade that was exposed br br if you can find this uncut it's worth a look
<START> rock hudson's second venture in the science fiction genre after seconds is embryo a film that combines elements of the bride of frankenstein and pygmalion in one rather weird film about for lack of a better word a test tube baby that grows up to be barbara carrera br br hudson is scientist experimenting in organic development and gets a chance to first experiment on his own doberman pincher when it is accidentally hit by his car br br some secretions from the female dog are given to a prematurely born puppy and it grows remarkably into an adult exalted with his success hudson takes a fetus from a dead accident victim and gives it some of the same stuff br br what he gets is barbara carrera and she develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious rate what she doesn't do is develop emotionally still hudson passes her off as his new research assistant to friends and family like sister in law diane ladd son john and daughter in law anne br br embryo doesn't explore some of the real issues in this kind of science it exploits them instead the special effects as they are are pretty second rate hudson looks like he lost interest in the project about halfway through the film br br now what would have really been interesting is if he had gotten boy child and it grew up to be a harlequin novel hero now that would have been something rock hudson could have sunk his teeth into
<START> this movie simply does not work the action scenes were shot to look stylish but just come out looking sloppy seagal barely fights and a lot of his scenes are shot from the back if you look in some of the scenes it is not even him but a 100 lb lighter stunt double the movie is just all around bad
<START> and this movie easily exceeded my expectations the fact that it is written and directed by peter dalle led me to believe it was in style with other films i'm used to and bored with seeing him in anyway i grudgingly went along to see this flick and that i'm glad for this stuff has humour and depth 9 out of 10 see it
<START> this movie really shows its age the print i saw was terrible due to age but it is possible that there are better prints out there however this was not the major problem with the movie the problem was that although the film was made in 1933 it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered only a few sentences in the film in the most amateur fashion sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and cleaverly hide the fact that the film was dubbed well its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious it just looked cheap br br overall the film looked low budget and silly it's really a shame though because there was a grain of a good story a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and or has no interest in women but in the 21st century few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess even with a few glimpses of the naked and somewhat chunky hedy lamarr it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted even by 1933 standards this film was a poorly made dud about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to america she looks like 2 completely different people br br it's such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film i don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews for technical problems alone the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it
<START> the first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history almost as good as the shower scene in psycho and the acting by robert walker is fantastic a psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murders thatÂ´s the story and overall this film is very good but theres one problem why guy haines go to br br the cop in the first place 4 5
<START> having already seen the original jack frost i never thought that jack frost 2 would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again a pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first a pix sequel and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more a pix sequels br br it's hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring which are essentially snowballs with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first jack frost had no such effects br br i'd strongly recommend that you see the original jack frost before seeing this one both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense sense being a relative term br br now only if there was uncle sam 2
<START> usually i start my reviews with an explanation of how and why i watched the film i'm reviewing with this i simply cannot explain i needed to be awake early for work the next day so the last thing i wanted to do was watch a film that i didn't know anything about but something kept me glued to my comfy futon as i watched this heather graham vehicle oh that's right boredom br br graham plays a bohemian nut case who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the guy she married played by luke wilson when her hubby decides to set off in search of better things work women and scripts presumably begins a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from his spiritual wheelchair it sounds like i'm making this up but sadly i'm not in reality this is little more than an acting exercise for graham as she gamely gives this phoebe from friends role a work out oh and goran er visnjic is in there as well for some reason br br the tv schedules had this down as a comedy but i failed to find a single laugh anywhere it struck me that this was a personal journey for lisa krueger the director and writer in the same mould as girl interrupted but even that had more laughs than this graham's character is simply too self centred for the audience to care about and i felt sorry for the hen pecked husband as he bravely fought for his freedom from his clearly mental wife very little of this film made sense as characters simply appeared in the story as though they were standing around waiting for graham to turn up like the extras in the truman show in fact the only positive note i can produce from my scribblings was heather graham nice baps and that wasn't because i was too tired to enjoy the film br br in truth it's very difficult to think of anybody to recommend this film to graham purists a very small number of overall movie goers i think you'll agree will have to be committed to watch this dross and possibly hippy students who collect american indian dream catchers will take something from this i was amazed that the average rating at time of writing was 5 0 that would make this film as good as die another day and gothika in my book and that simply ain't right committed is a quirky oddball mess of a movie that neither entertains or enlightens it's complicated pointless and simply too boring for my tastes and probably yours too don't even think about watching this
<START> the show is great no words to describe it wonderful music incredible dance the editors couldn't spoil it not because they were not that bad but because the show is really that good br br the editors are compulsive cutters you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs it's ok to show various angles but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average they manage to film the start of a jump with one camera then cut it in the middle and show the rest of it in another angle br br no matter how much they tried they couldn't spoil that wonderful show it's a must for dance and music lovers
<START> each story has a lesson for young and old but what more i have to say may spoil a future story but i believe what i have to say is for everyone just for one particular episode the soldier and death br br okay of all the stories the one that sticks out for me is the soldier and death because is was the point in my life i realized that life was terminal i am not kidding the airing was on my 8 1 2 birthday and i will always remember it i didn't remember its title until tonight but i new the synopsis may 15th 1988 br br it is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part in life it is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact i am living proof currently 28 yrs old that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults br br i write this with tears in my eyes heath ledger a wonderful actor my own age died today it kinda reminded me of many lessons i have learned in my life so i write this as a reminder to young and old no one is immune to whatever is in store for us br br i hate to say that death is going to happen but this story was the first time i saw death as not a bad thing but a part of life was quite literally in this story i can't help it it was a life changing moment for me and will alway be br br and for that br br i love you jim henson and i still remember much of your work in life up until the day you died and your memorial muppet show and thank you brian henson for keeping the workshop alive honest i do thank you all of your co workers editors and interns br br the stage is just a stage and a show is just a show but imagination will create magic that forever the world will know br br thank you br br and for all who doubt me dance magic dance
<START> i just saw this stinky old boiler on tv best watched with a very large of dr jungle juice at hand this cheese fest is hilariously bad on the very slim plus side raquel was in her physical prime she looks good and you get to see a fair bit of her since she plays a go go dancer she had great legs that's for sure there's also some minor interest for screen buffs in the footage of los angeles ca '69 and in spotting actors in minor parts who went on to better things veteran thesp ron rifkin 'brothers and sisters' delivers a toe curling early performances as sailor the faggot junkie barman who rats raquel out to the bad guy you might also recognise the gun toting security guard in the hit and run scene it's a very early appearance by gordon jump who gave such a lovely performance in as piece of br br the 'plot' of such as it is follows the travails of an exotic dancer welch on the run from her murderous ex husband luke askew this turkey is classic production line hollywood sludge a paint by numbers script pedestrian direction hokey shots edits and effects ultra cheesy stock music plywood sets and performances to match br br the cast is as uniformly dreadful as the screenplay although raquel is capable of fair performances in the right vehicle this old clunker is so bad that she doesn't really stand a chance and neither does the audience one of my favourite moments occurs when raquel awakes up in the hospital sees the vegas cop who's pursuing her murderous ex and asks how did you get here to which he of course replies in a plane oh the humanity and you won't be able to take your eyes off the doctor michael who has what might well be one of the very worst walk ons in the long sad history of bad cameos i don't think i've ever seen anyone stand in one spot so badly before br br love interest joe james stacy ambles through the film with a fixed look that's somewhere between bemused and embarrassed and no wonder this bomb puts the cast through just about every made for tv clichÃ© in the book from spectacularly dreadful turn in the dreadful nightmare montage to the pure schlock of the 'romantic' horse ride along leo beach br br spoiler warning just about the only interesting thing in the whole film is the denouement in which raquel finally gets her own back and hilariously enacts the title by setting the baddie on fire whoever the stunt guy was really earned his money on this one he goes up like linda in a heatwave yet even this fairly spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crew moves into shot near the end br br there are so many crappy things about that it's oddly compelling i found yourself wondering if this could be one of the worst films i've ever seen made the answer seemed to be a resounding 'yes' until i saw the film that followed it roger corman's mega trashy classic 'the big doll house' which takes awful to a whole new level i can heartily recommend these two as a double bill you'll laugh yourself silly
<START> a touching movie about a talented woman who struggles with a society and a love that structurally underestimate her the issues are subtly addressed and timeless as many of the depicted difficulties between man and woman still exist in dutch society today this movie is a tribute to all modern women without dwelling on feminism not only the story is well told the acting and the scenery are great as well
<START> whomever thought of having sequels to iron eagle must be shot in this case once was enough iron eagle was a good movie to watch even though it is unrealistic it is still entertaining iron eagle ii has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia i didn't even bother to watch iron eagle iii but from looking at the r rating i assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies well iron eagle iv is probably the most inane sequel lou gossett jr returns as the always delightful chappy sinclair another jason returns to fill the role of doug masters canadian jason who looks just like jason from the first iron eagle but wait here comes a possible spoiler wasn't doug killed in iron eagle ii the writers must've been for a story so they revived doug masters by saying he was a prisoner of the russians this movie was the cheapest done of all the iron eagle films why do movie makers find it to make sequels to unappealing movies ex police academy movies i have always liked gossett jr 's work in these films he was the only one holding this turkey together let's hope this was the last of the iron eagle sequels let it rest in peace
