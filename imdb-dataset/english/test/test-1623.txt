<START> this is a movie that should have been a mini series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space the whole story is constantly being bombarded with sub plots character introduction and meaningless pieces information that go nowhere there is a underlying plot where boy meets a girl she has doubts but gets married anyhow and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real they turn out not to be but her husband won't believe that she was not unfaithful and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her as she was not unfaithful to her husband with that said there are no less than 1000 sub plots and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible in the first 15 minutes you are inundated with so many things and situations that you just stop caring you don't care about any of the confused and screwed up cast that drifts in and out of the story like vultures feeding on a corpse each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer after a half hour and completely disinterested i stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity i couldn't imagine where it was going but like staring at a fire i just couldn't get up and turn it off the production values are superb but the resulting movie is a waste of time wash your socks instead
<START> this is the best comedy period it is so underrated clever witty humor great casting jerry stiller is the jewel in the show he is so incredibly funny and quirky simply a comical genius doug and carrie have great chemistry i so do not see what the hype is about when it comes to everybody loves raymond it is so overrated with lame jokes mostly forced humor and just not the witty show i can't remember laughing in more than 1 episode king of queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you serious belly laughs which is normally caused by arthur spooner i think its about time this comedy gets the hype it deserves and not the lame raymond co
<START> spike is a comic genius demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that have made shows like letterman and the daily show successful his likability is palpable he seems to find the unique angle of the joke not the predictable sitcom path thank god his comedy is reminiscent of the award winning arrested development cross your fingers that has a longer life span the topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by unnoticed by everyone else yet when he creates a joke around them out you wonder how you missed it the first time around i particularly enjoyed the sketches unfair target will be a cult classic in no time set your tivo's people this is a show not to be missed
<START> the movie is really cool i thought it sticks to the original game quite well and some of the battle scenes are depicted in such high detail it's incredible i thought the movie could have been a little better if they'd give you a little more information before the end but trying to figure out what's going on is what hooks on you this movie br br the cg is beautiful i don't think they could have done a better job graphics wise every little detail the way they move the way their swords look everything is perfect the way they make the characters look is almost like they're real people br br the music was great and i found it entertaining to listen to just how much of it was remixed from the original game with new instruments and effects br br all and all i'd recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys fast paced action and a good storyline i would definitely play the game before i'd watch the movie though
<START> the kite runner began as one of those important films that most people fawn over because they are told that they should if they want to be among the elite and quickly descended into an idiotic film of absurdly outlandish proportions br br i've never read the book and never felt the need because i honestly don't care sure i'm called uninformed for saying it but i truly have no interest whatsoever in just another pull at your heartstrings copy off of all other story lines to get emotion from the readers novel even if it is set in afghanistan br br that said i watched the movie i heard good things about its beauty and how touching it was and decided why not as it turns out there was a very good reason why not not only was the so called main character completely unsympathetic i get it he was young and this is a film about redemption but honestly he was horrible i hated him and not in that good 'anti hero' way he was just a dull idiotic self absorbed character that i felt nothing towards but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that i couldn't believe how everyone else was fawning over how beautiful it was and how they cried and it moved them i'm sorry but i only feel moved by something that feels realistic sci fi has been known to move me fantasy as well but this please this surpassed many other movies for pure absurdity my biggest peeve hassan was brother really you sure you didn't just rip that off from a thousand other stories positive that that particular tidbit wasn't just added in to try to pull more tears out of your audiences y'know the type of people who look for reasons to cry during a movie i was rolling my eyes when that twist was revealed knowing that it could only go downhill from there not to mention flashing back to star wars amir hassan is your brother nooooo that's not true that's impossible oh and it certainly did filled to the brim with clichÃ©'s and just plan dumb storytelling like good guy miraculously escapes bad guy against all odds with help from spunky kid who despite being viciously sodomized and having no clue who you are is willing to help out with a conveniently placed weapon that holds special meaning to you ooh and don't forget the oh so idiotic finally getting vengeance on the kid who teased you when you were little who surprise surprise has turned into a psychopathic adult trust me guys i understand you like to live vicariously through movies but that'll never happen you know that kid who teased you in high school he's no terrorist he's probably an accountant br br oh and i must mention the cgi tastic kites i think those were on par with the matrix movies and transformers bravo you guys bravo br br it seems this movie was just made for western audiences who need to a reason to care about the middle east hey an overly emotional friendship story will work this is one of the most shallow movies i've had the misfortune of seeing it poses as deep well but when you get right down to it it's nothing special br br unfortunately the core of america's audience will do what they're told and follow the it's about controversial material so it must be good way of thinking
<START> i watched pp the other night i have to say i was very impressed with how real the film seemed it felt very much like a documentary i also think that the film presented realistic possibilities in the film the war in vietnam escalates to the point where china has become involved what if that had happened i think the scenarios would be similar to the one portrayed in the movie we have had camps before in this country and still do br br highly recommended for everyone especially radicals br br i kept saying that if i were in the position that those kids were in that i would just lie my ass off i love america and its grand wars wink wink
<START> dr stephens micheal harvey runs a mental asylum he has a different approach to the insane he conducts unorthodox methods of treatment he treats everyone like family there are no locks on the patients doors and he lets some of the inmates act out their twisted fantasies he lets sergeant hugh dress and act as a soldier and harriet camilla carr be a mother to a doll including letting her put it to bed in a cot dr stevens is outside letting judge oliver w cameron gene ross chop a log up with an axe it turns out to be a bad move as once dr stevens back is turned the judge plants the axe in his shoulder soon after nurse charlotte beale rosie arrives at the sanitarium having arranged an interview with dr stevens about a possible job she is met by the head nurse geraldine masters annabelle as anne mcadams and is offered a trail position she gets to know and becomes well liked among the patients however things eventually start to turn sour the phone lines are cut an old lady named mrs rhea macadams has her tongue cut out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just aren't right somehow then one night all the sanitariums dark secrets are violently revealed produced and directed by s f this film has a great central idea which builds into a cool twist ending but ultimately is a bit of a chore to sit through because of it's low budget restrictions and a rather slow script by tim pope there are just too many long boring stretches of dialogue by the inmates not a lot really happens until the final twenty odd minutes the film has no real visual quality as it's set entirely in the sanitarium and it's grounds which is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere there's no graphic gore in it a few splashes of blood here and there and thats yer lot there's a bit of nudity but like the gore not much the acting is pretty strong especially and the photography is flat and unexciting and i can't even remember what the music was like the twist ending is great but it just takes far too long to get to it a film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by it's budget ok i guess but i think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half an hour 'tales form the crypt' episode
<START> i finally watched the third film in mehta's trilogy fire to begin i'd say that water was the unquestionable masterpiece on all levels fire comes next with earth close behind in order of quality fire there is so much going on in this film that i'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in the writing is superb the script creating friction that starts the entire process of heat from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships br br mehta is one brave lady she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced false and repressive about the great society from which she came from india is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change that she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of water after having had the script cleared shows that there are still many taboo subjects which indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face cannot examine or discuss them worse if someone like mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues she faces death threats so as much as india thinks of itself as a tolerant society the facts are not always so whereas earth was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after indian independence fire and water are pointing at personal social and religious issues which as i say are considered so strongly in a negative sense that an open artistic dialog is still many years away as i write this water is scheduled to actually be shown in india later this year i'll believe it when i see it br br fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that i saw in a price above whether it's arranged marriages which it used to be like among jews about 150 years ago or like it is among many modern indians they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women or just plain loveless marriages however this is not the real issue mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery water or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages fire i am no expert regarding either the secular or hindu laws concerning divorce the film seems to imply that the stigma of divorce is almost as bad as the sad marriage in any case mehta's film is a very moving powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern indian relationships up to probing scrutiny that all three of these films have made themselves felt in india as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack i admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough superb disturbing provocative taboo shattering
<START> cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes on the lam looking for the real culprit the familiar hitchcock theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is nicely played out in this entertaining fare that has elements of the thirty nine steps and north by northwest although it is not as good as either of those classics there are some impressive set pieces including the finale on the statue of liberty the plot is implausible and unconvincing and after a terrific start it seems to run out of steam cummings is likable if somewhat stiff in the lead lane is the blonde but not the cool variety of the director's later films the supporting roles are generally well played
<START> victor mature as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper may be on the poster but robert preston as a failed union colonel who led his men to get cut to ribbons by confederate artillery at shiloh and is sent to a fort in oregon for his incompetence has the most interesting part married to a young and hard to recognize at first anne bancroft the uncivilized mature lusts for the colonel's wife giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference another man's wife at one point by james whitmore who plays mature's older and wiser mountain man father figure directed by anthony mann this film is lost among his more famous westerns with james stewart but even so you really don't need the indian menace to make this a film worth seeing although preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the indians under submission in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout
<START> i cannot get over how awful this movie was my eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible awful one song soundtrack there are four kids and dog and they run away from a hospital then get away with stealing two cars and a bus no one gives them any punishment or anything to correct them the acting is just so awful it sounds like an instruction video for social studies class i cannot think of one thing that i like about this movie nothing even the kid that loses his dog made me want to vomit he gets his dog back without the lady even seeing the dog run out the door maybe the dog was trying to escape out of this movie then there is some horse manure in the whole mix it was torture watching this movie then at the end the oldest boy says something like staying together isn't a crime and they all hug him and love him stealing gas is a crime stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have went to juvenile hall or something avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together
<START> crazy scottish warrior race stranded deep in outer space low on food and budget free started ten now down to three who will help these men of pluck with visual effects that semi suck but i kinda liked the freaky being if i met one then i'd be fleeing but not if i had scottish mates we'd f'n swear and avoid that fate so in the end it wasn't botched it was a dvd i'm glad i watched but if they ever make a sequel dump some actors not all were equal some were good with gritty acting some were wooden and should maybe pack it in but the action kept me watching all the shooting shouting didn't stall i'll tell my friends not to fear and watch again in another year
<START> well now that all of the director productions company's friends and relations have posted their shill reviews after seeing this at various festivals i guess it's time to show reviews written by people who actually paid 10 bucks to see it br br like the director's dear jesse the only other one of his films i have seen loggerheads suffers from a lack of focus and too many ideas crammed into an indie budget i swear this guy might have better luck doing miniseries i kept waiting for the various plot threads to come together but they only intercepted at points blatantly forshadowed in a way obvious to all but the most dense viewer it was like watching a season of lifetime made for tv movies crammed into one long did i say looong sketch on the old carol burnett show maybe an enterprising male suitor could take his girlfriend to see this and then exclaim hey remember all of the chick flicks we went to last year the one about the adoptive mother the one about the gay guy the one about the christian housewife we went to three chick flicks last year so now we have to go see terminator 4 i guess one has to do anything to cast a familiar actor to get funding but what oh what is bonnie hunt doing in this flick she isn't exactly known as a dramatic actress and this attempted performance won't be sending mr oscar to her door i mean speaking of lifetime original movies wasn't valerie bertinelli or farah fawcett available ms hunt has always come off to me as cold maybe she should have played the other mom i wish i would have chosen capote to fill my weekly gay themed indie allowance oh well maybe next week i think there is a good reason why capote is playing at tons of theatres all over the nyc area and this one is playing at only one let the distributors faith in this flick assure to to run in the opposite direction if you don't trust this review
<START> infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that surrounds them and i have yet to come across a worse offender than wes craven's the hills have eyes having held back from watching this for years i was really pleased when i got it for christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying i needn't have bothered br br after a promising if familiar start that firmly sets the film in the world of survival horror things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wasteland br br looking like it was shot on a budget of 5 with the cannibal costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and red indian attire the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic wasps who take a detour on a road trip to california to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone when they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesh eaters and have to fight to survive br br while hoping for another deliverance texas chainsaw massacre wrong turn or devil's rejects i actually realised i'd stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video store's bargain bin br br with gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound close ups i can kind of see how an 18 certificate in the uk is justified but with those close ups trimmed this wouldn't have looked out of place as a saturday afternoon thriller on itv br br the whole silver mine nuclear test site subplot is just a mcguffin to justify pitching the family against the primitives but given how easily the savages get their asses whupped it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passers by br br and then there's the ending or lack thereof the hills have eyes seems to be missing either a third act or at the very least a satisfying denouement instead i was just left wondering yeah and
<START> i was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 i saw this film three years ago at the vancouver international film festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so i could send everyone i know to see it it's like taking a trip to india colorful magical thought provoking aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy the characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through rajasthan is like dreamlike sometimes it's hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is real the movie has that same quality great soundtrack too
