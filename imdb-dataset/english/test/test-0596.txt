<START> this film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the very protracted end br br the plot is confused and laboured the actors have a couldn't care less attitude maybe they were paid in advance bad move or knew they weren't going to get paid and the sets were featureless boring and cheap br br i fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as i assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then more life time wasted br br if you must watch it then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once but maybe you'll need an antidepressant instead br br sometimes it's good if celluloid degrades
<START> wow this movie sucked br br this movie was a embarrassment to the original br br everything about this movie was awful br br the acting was horrendous every part except the part of the manager was terrible br br luke perry though only bit parts was absolutely awful this was is worst role ever even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone you'd want to punch even in the end lol br br this movie reminded me of those kid movies that go that extra mile making a part goofy way beyond the funny stage the humor was for 6 year olds br br if your over 12 and want something worthwhile to watch skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead
<START> perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the usa runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons br br unlike the often innocuous criticism found in the simpsons a pretty good show in its own right and the rude for rudeness sake humour in south park every bit of this series follows a plan the criticism of us society from its to its selfishness carries much more bite than it does in any other animated series br br the cultural references in also tend to be obscure sometimes anyone browsing the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught in that it is different from the simpsons which usually uses pop culture instead of the high brow stuff often hidden in as other people writing about it notice there is a growth in the characters bernice and also by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy as is made clear in episodes like the once and future duck love her until the end of your days ' and in takes a holiday when he takes a chance to tell beverly all those things he couldn't tell beatrice the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality br br one can't avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness br br all in all in my opinion the best cartoon ever made in the usa and one of the best series ever i doubt it will ever be on dvd though far too many things the duck said make much more sense today
<START> this movie desperate measures was i'm not quite sure how to even put it into words was this supposed to be a comedy i couldn't stop laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was i love michael keaton and i cannot actually comprehend that he did this they did a good job at keeping my attention because i couldn't wait to see how much more ridiculous it was going to get minute by minute i actually just registered on this site so that i could get this out i don't review movies i don't have time for this but i cannot let this go knowing i haven't done my civil duty by letting people those who have an iq of 85 and above know that this is no action thriller it is honest to goodness funny you people that actually got thrills off of this scare me go watch a good movie like million dollar baby clint eastwood's acting is not superb but i was balling at the end exercise your brain america
<START> spoiler alert please don't read if you don't want the movie spoiled br br i was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it so me my friend made plans to see it after school today boy are we glad we did the movie starts off in italy with a planned heist with a group of guys charlie mark whalberg steve edward norton lyle also known as seth green you'll get the nickname later handsome rob jason statham left ear mos deaf john donald sutherland plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks this leads to the whole opening which is a good 10 to 15 minutes and involves a boat chase which opens the movie up right while driving away in their get away van steve turns on the group steals the gold and kills john who is pretty much the retiring leader of the group fast to a year later where where stella charlize theron john's daughter is one of the top safe crackers that anyone can ask for charlie who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death as he called him out of retirement for the heist says that they've found steve who has gone into hiding and want to get back at him for what he did she at first declines but later agrees and the back together along with getting the help of wrench franky g a mechanic to carry out the perfect heist while creating one of the largest traffic jams in los angeles history this movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout there's an on running joke about seth green's character lyle creating and how shawn fanning who makes a cameo stole it while he fell asleep and eventually lyle will only answer if refered to as there's even a funny line in the movie by seth who goes he said in an interview he called it because it described his hair like it was nappy he it that because i was napping when he stole it the begining and ending sequences are pure genius and everything in between fits perfectly the only negative thing i can think of with the movie is that edward norton's acting was a bit weak he wasn't a big tough bad guy he acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare minimum which is a fact as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation but even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film the movie is still very enjoyable and i definetly recommend seeing it and even if you're not interested in the actual movie go to see seth green shine in the comedic role he's perfect rating out of
<START> this movie is excellent the passion between jade billy is memorable and the acting was great this is why you don't leave a 16 year old and a young man like that alone together it shows why a single mother shouldn't date a younger man with a teen aged daughter in the house cause he looked young enough to be son br br i give it ten out of ten the acting was wonderful and the movements between the actors was correct br br the age difference between jenny and rob was good too because they were similar in age br br overall its a fun movie but i think nobody under 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes
<START> some tv programs continue into embarrassment my beloved 'x files' comes to mind i've been a fan of dennis farina since 'crime story ' another late lamented show 'buddy never had a chance the series had a good premise and great actors it's really really a shame
<START> how do i describe the horrors first some points first this review should be taken with a grain of salt i saw this over 20 years ago when i was a boy at the museum of modern art in new york city br br secondly i am giving away some scenes and plot points however it does not have much of a plot br br finally i don't enjoy these type of art films anyway br br this film was directed by proto auteur luis bunuel he was a surrealist and dadaist these were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's was the school of art that made things hyper real yet often had freudian symbolism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an infant dada or father br br made in black and white it was also made by a band of communists or as they preferred the term socialists bunuel and his group of fellow film makers and artistes had been working on a number of symbolic ideas and issues in spain and france between the world wars br br and surrealism influenced a lot of artists the police doo doo doo da poet arthur munch the scream rene magritte floating hats in space salvador dali melting clocks and even hitchcock psycho no norman rockwell br br here's what i recall most about this film a girl meets up with a cow her eye gets slashed by a razor clownish men cavort in a meadow there is not as i said much of a plot but then again that must be the point br br this was attacked as porn back then and would be again today one of the trade marks of surrealism is a significant anti feminism
<START> university professor justin thorne jimmy has got it made a good looking sophisticated teacher with a loving wife and two adorable children he plays the saxophone owns an expensive car and his students love and respect him but when temptation calls in the form of one of his bright pretty sexy and willing students jennifer carter naomi watts he foolishly gives in the next day he is being charged with her rape and his perfect life could be forever ruined br br when we see an american actor in australian film we know we are not in for a masterpiece but even viewed with low expectations gross misconduct is a huge flop based on a play with a rather unimaginative title and then adapted into a reasonably enjoyable book it fails to engage convince or even remotely interest its audience on a most fundamental level the script is awkward and unconvincing the acting is for most part not much better watts gives an acceptable performance demonstrating for one of the first times on screen her emotion rawness but she is the only good thing about the film which seems almost like even it can't wait to be over br br the direction is not horrible or distracting in anyway but it is just painfully mediocre apart from the afore mentioned naomi watts who could be forgiven seeing as this was early in her career the acting is wooden and gets steadily worse over the course of the movie the usually reliable jimmy doesn't seem to have been trying in this one and who could really blame him all these small failures however only add to the film's ultimate fatal flaw which is that the focus is entirely in the wrong place any empathy for the characters or interest in the outcome is lost in a sea of what is basically soft core entertainment of an adult kind by the end audiences will probably be bored tired and wishing they'd done something else with their ninety minutes unless you just want to see naomi get naked 4 or 5 times you could definitely afford to give this film a miss
<START> another go round with the monkey king going west sort of br br beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward br br a monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world but an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town the evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever the battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety the monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys the monk ends up with a bunch of lizard imps who plan at some point eating him however the bad guys arrive and he's off an odyssey with the ugliest of the lot br br can a movie that starts off the rails go off the rails don't get me wrong i really liked this movie but its so scatter shot and all over the place that plot and logic simply fall away as some scenes simply pick up mid action with no way of knowing how we got there the final battle to rescue the disciples is completely out of left field this is one of the messiest movies i've seen in a while but it made me laugh and smile like no get out the movie starts and you have no idea where things are and then whats on screen is either interesting or funny and you just go with it how do we get from thing to thing is often beyond me its full of odd asides and strange references as we go from heaven to the ocean to space to the rib cage of some mythic beast to god knows where this movie floats all over the place which helps keep it fun since you don't know where it will end up and is the reason m keeping details to a minimum and its funny very very funny at times br br and the action is very good even if a good chunk of it is unabashed cgi animation which provides for some cool images the golden staff the spider attack formation the angel in flight and its very touching action and comedy aside this is actually a wonderful love story its the story of an ugly imp and a monk who end up falling in love and having other complications its a interesting look at the nature of love and what is true love you will be moved br br however much i enjoyed it i was still annoyed by its scatter shot construction the films inability to hold its ideas together and to tell a complete story really hurts the film and takes away from the enjoyment every time we get to a bump in the road the bumps take you out of the movie itself and make you realize how much is being cribbed from other sources br br absolutely worth seeing since it does have many choice moments just be prepared for some bumps and you'll have a good time
<START> lets face it australian tv is for the most part terrible but this is a real diamond in the rough that not enough people are watching the chaser crew who do the satirical newspaper and try something new by mixing live comedy pre recorded skits and political satire into one show filmed in front of a live audience sorta like rove but funny they love causing controversy and this causes some of the shows funniest moments especially chris telling his wife to f off live on breakfast television and julian handing a novelty cheque signed by saddam to the head of the it has to be one of the funniest aussie shows since the program
<START> this movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that have done br br it looks like a commercial from beginning to end the the whole time on a tripod it doesn't have pace rhythm it's illogical what a mess you can tell what's gonna happen since the first 15 minutes and the ending wow br br spoiler br br jesus christ how the hell got shot are you serious worst scene of someone getting shot ever br br end of spoiler br br bad directing bad script bad acting really bad overall i wouldn't recommend this movie at all it's a waste of money and time
<START> i haven't actually seen a lot of movies with holly hunter but seeing her in broadcast news was a pleasant surprise she is a hard nosed journalist jane craig who has devoted all of her time to tv news show her colleague aaron altman has carried her torch for a long time without saying anything the love triangle is completed by tom he is the slightly aloof ex sportscaster who is the new reporter to jane he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting turning it into not serious business much to her surprise jane finds herself attracted to tom br br holly hunter is doing a great performance as the perky journalist but i don't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague tom it's something with them that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him almost as impressive is albert brooks who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent for his job but doesn't get quite as much in return actually for a while i thought he was steve guttenberg from police academy 1984 he has a few funny lines and if this was a meg ryan picture they'd call it a romantic comedy br br running over two hours a few scenes could have been edited or left out completely eg jane's and aaron's trip to central america also i'm a sucker for happy endings and had preferred a different ending than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later
<START> bloody marvelous recommended by a friend who knew i liked thomas kretschmann in the pianist and downfall i loved the flow of the narrative how the characters moved from hope and ideals of valour through shock fear disintegration desperation and utter annihilation a first rate anti war movie that must have created quite the stir in germany not a proud moment for anyone and the study of a generation lost this movie was excellent at conveying the remove of the command from the ground troops and in pounding the utter futility of trying to control untamed nature and the russian psyche if i didn't know i would have thought it was a russian movie it was so fatalistic what an uncompromising ending a
<START> mind numbingly boring utterly predictable and in the end simply laughable that pretty much sums up the disaster that is indecent proposal starting with a decent premise the whole thing just unravels and becomes a complete mess basically the story boils down to the question would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars here of course the answer is yes because otherwise we wouldn't have a movie quite frankly we'd have been better off if we didn't have a movie br br our married and financially troubled couple are played by woody harrelson and demi moore they go to vegas to get rich yeah that'll work anyhow a billionaire played by robert redford takes a liking to the wife and makes the million dollar offer for one night with the wife he will give them financial security the aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining the script is so predictable you can say the characters' lines before they do the performances leave much to be desired harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying and it is quite safe to say that demi moore will never have to clear space in her home for any academy awards why is she a movie star again in a part that should be full of emotion she conveys none only redford escapes mostly unscathed he's appropriately slimy yet suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch but he can't save this film awful script lousy acting plodding pace zero entertainment indecent proposal is downright awful
