<START> ok say some college in southern california has an movie making class and some dudes were enrolled just to film girls and they gave them a camera and then they were drunk stoned or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera and they turned this in for their grade and failed br br that is my only explanation for this this thing good god they left the date and time counter on during some of it the picture started in new scene way before the sound and forget about a plot well apparently there was one and they had to tell you all about it once the 3 hour introduction sequence was finished but i am glad they did because i never would have gotten it by watching this br br stay away from this
<START> i viewed the first two nights before coming to imdb looking for some actor info i saw the 9 rating which surprised me since i was not that impressed by what i'd seen as reference i happen to believe lonesome dove was the best tv western ever i grew up next to the mgm back lots in culver city in the 50s and have a certain sense of reverence about the western genre br br so i saw the glowing first review and decided to read more there i found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development poor editing feeling that it was shot on the universal back lot mgm's is long gone and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about ld my impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was less than a 4 0 br br this got me to wondering about the process that yields a 9 rating if the people giving the 10s and 9s do not take the time to justify their vote is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation i have long used imdb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available now i am not so sure
<START> a lot about usa the movie can be summed up in its title it draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of hollywood like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified i'm not sure i agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events although truthfully i can't always tell exactly where he stands but i admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across audio tracks of speeches radio interviews poetry etc play as large a role here as visuals most of the time the visuals of the story are accompanied by these audio elements to good effect i'm kind of a radio buff so it was satisfying to hear the way that radio was integrated into the pace of the movie in fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another that's not to say that there aren't characters real people but except for jim the protagonist a kind of '60's drop out with an erratic state of mind the others come and go pretty quickly a few make a very powerful impression especially a guru like taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself when he breaks out into a spontaneous song of prayer while driving jim to the subway it is a very powerful moment on the cover of the dvd is the quote the danger is clear which is taken from president bush's speech that paved the way to our incursion into iraq in retrospect hearing that speech at a climactic moment in the film brought home how we are living in a historically charged moment which will always be remembered
<START> this film is a hodge podge of various idiotic cliches for instance boy meets spoilt rich girl and gets her to fall in love with him by harassing her in college an over used backdrop in recent indian commercial films a male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest the climax is predictable having been used ad nauseum in several other films as with many other recent commercial hindi films the film abounds with the incongruous insertion of songs which probably contributed to the film's success more than anything else
<START> this episode sucks br br over the past few years i have watched all episodes of next generation and voyager and am now watching enterprise br br i am thoroughly enjoying this series until this episode i stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment it is more like an attempt at slapstick br br it does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb and leaves the audience gasping it does little to build the series br br why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me was it the writing was it the directing was it the producer we'll probably never know br br but one bad apple isn't bad i suppose i say that hoping it is only one
<START> the thomas crown affair is a terrible remake of a not very good movie redeemable only for the topless shots of former supermodel renee russo br br that's it the plot is negligible pierce brosnan phoned in his part and dennis leary as usual plays an annoying irish cop but i couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful ms russo there's an okay love making scene on a stairway a terrifically sexy ballroom dance a topless beach scene and a roll in the sack oh and there's a painting stolen from a museum and a gets sunk br br but let's hope other directors recognize ms russo's perky attributes and cast her in more highly visible roles
<START> i think that toy soldiers is an excellent movie it's one of the only movies that aside from some well known actors has an unknown cast that can actually act in my opinion the plot is captivating it keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that couldn't possibly happen in real life i think that everyone would enjoy this movie sean astin always seems to pick the perfect movies to be in that showcase his talent he's very underrated and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves other movies that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this movie and rudy really showcase him because he is the main character in both i hope that he someday gets the accolades he deserves for his acting if you want to see a great movie you need to check this one out and if you are a sean astin fan you will definitely like this movie
<START> this is a beautifully made film finely balancing the fragile human stories both before and after 1945 and the indiscriminating combat of war the use of outtakes from battle of britain a film that does not nearly so well portray the 1940s enhances rather than detracts from the whole a deeply impressive work this lived in my memory for the 2 years since i saw it and i have just bought it to explore the making of extras br br i highly recommend this film movie like aces high it alternates between viscerally exciting or scary air combat sequences where the viewer might experience actual loss of characters they'd come to care about but also unpredictable interactions on the ground where skillful writers and real life experiences inform some involving and moving events this also underlines the fact that for many people 1945 marked not just the end of one conflict but the beginning of another and even today we still don't recognise the loss bravery and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes or even worse we venerate them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that entails making their sacrifices all the more valiant br br watching this movie is an experience which will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy and back to love that endures even beyond death if all war films were like this we'd never have to fight again br br did i mention it's worth watching br br 10 10
<START> while the dog was cute the film was not it wasn't the premise or the theme that was a problem the premise had great possibilities for humor and pathos both the theme is a worthy one helping other people is more important than amassing a fortune br br sadly the adorable dog the unique premise and the theme were undercut by poor acting stilted dialogue and amateurish filming br br even my youngest child who will sit through almost anything gave up before we had gotten halfway through how many times can that dog run up and down the same hallway i can't spoil it for you as i never saw the end it just was not worth watching all the way to the end
<START> if i had watched this movie when i hit rock bottom i probably would have sunk into the deepest depression of my life and may have been nearly desperate enough to try it the only thing is in the real world when you rob millions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals everything doesn't come up roses unless you are an investment banker or government affiliated so how does that matter i had been rejected from school after school and it stings so it is a brilliant topic for a movie and when you give yourself over to the imaginary to let yourself watch this movie without applying real world ramifications it can truly touch someone in that situation and let them know they are not alone overdone soliloquy completely tears apart the established educational system as we know it really all i can say is that as i am in college now looking back on where i was and watching this movie i can truly appreciate it in a way i never would have been able to otherwise it is juvenile and contrite yes but it is an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom and i cant think of a better way to end my night
<START> there is a serious scene in this movie a scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches it takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons they make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire the main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire some would call that too sad and or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick i call it honesty most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements this mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die the violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying a bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd br br renny harlin showed a hint of this in his first and sadly only hit die hard 2 the villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across the scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people on board going down but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used however to fit the spirit of the first film die hard 2 was mostly a fun action movie here that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive the violence is bloody the one liners are hilarious but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichÃ©d film wisecracks at key moments of action the plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films the villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power it is less ridiculous but also more frightening than that from recent films the bourne trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style but this film is from 1996 and 7 years before the bourne identity with matt damon made it to the big screen br br another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine and this is well before the movie version of tomb raider became a hit what's more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down john mcclane and then take his still lit cigarette this movie marks geena davis's second action heroine role and she still didn't manage to score a hit while angelina jolie stars in tomb raider years later and scores a hit the reasons are beyond me completely br br lastly this movie isn't all dark edged there are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film the climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break thus there is formula here but it is the anti formula for the everyday hollywood action movie formula 9 10 br br classification 13 violence profanity
<START> the secret life starts with the worst possible narrative intro the crimes committed by jeffrey dahmer are too horrible to make a film about okay so what are you suggesting that we shouldn't bother to continue watching as the film won't be accurate or bloody anyway and they were right too the film isn't the least bit shocking and contains almost no blood or gore at all although i think that's mainly due to the low budget production values and not because of dahmer's crimes being too horrific basically the secret life jeffrey dahmer is just one sequence repeated over and over again young pitiful and mentally confused jeffrey picks up victims always males as he was a homosexual kills them and then talks about how it wasn't his intention to hurt them and about how lonely he is this gets boring really quick and even the admirable performance by unknown actor carl crew can't save this movie from being a total dud still this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly muddled dahmer that got released in 2002
<START> joan cusack steals the show the premise is good the plot line interesting and the screenplay was ok a tad too simplistic in that a coming out story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quite so positive then again it is fiction all in all an entertaining romp br br one thing i noticed was the inside joke aspect since the target audience probably was straight they may not get the gay stuff in context with the story br br kevin kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that screenwriters sometimes don't take in consideration when suggesting kline for a part br br this one hit the mark
<START> this is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without a doubt the best the festival has had to offer i went into this film with little to no expectations after learning that the director was responsible for the awful vampire flick the forsaken and i left pleasantly surprised the film stars lori of in crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed she moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a gravesite to overworked children back in the day unlucky for them the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone in their path the film works on many levels it's well done suspenseful it has spots of good cinematography and capable performances by compton especially the atmosphere is spooky yet slightly underwhelming the score is decent and the makeup effects are gruesome and simplistic the film keeps up a creepy and unsettling tone and the kids themselves with pale skin torn up lips and hollow eyes are pretty scary and unrelenting the film is original and inventive without being to artsy or complicated i can't see this film making it into a wide release without some trimming and slight fine tuning but they definitely have a good product on there hands and should pursue some type of theatrical distribution however the theatre in which i saw it in was horrible the sound was dreadfully messed up which i felt took away from the film majorly and it stopped in the middle because they couldn't center it on the screen which killed the mood a bit all in all though it was the most satisfying of entries maybe because it had the least expectations but nonetheless was a welcome addition to genre films
<START> i think samuel goldwyn was trying to accomplish two things in this film first the film is a homage to jascha considered to be the best violin virtuoso of the past century secondly having brought to the screen the dead end kids with his film of the same title and seeing them sign with warner brothers he was trying to create a second gang of appealing urchins br br though the film was good there certainly was no demand that the kids from this film be reteamed for another feature br br leader of the gang is gene reynolds who at one time played the violin but now leads a street gang of disreputable urchins his stepfather arthur hohl breaks the violin his late father gave young reynolds and threatens to send him to reform school over the feeble protests of his mother marjorie main br br young reynolds happens to stumble onto a music school run by the old music maestro himself walter brennan and his daughter andrea they take him in but they have their financial problems with a lot of creditors led by porter hall br br this film is mostly to be seen today because it's a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear jascha who as you gather is the solution one way or another to everybody's problems joel mccrea is in this film also but has a rather colorless part as andrea boyfriend br br besides one thing the film does do is touch on albeit gingerly on the topic of child abuse and battered spouses arthur hohl is one mean man and marjorie main is very clearly a much battered wife br br the kids in the cast do well reynolds tommy kelly terry and a young girl under the name of jacqueline nash who grew up and performed as gale sherwood nightclub partner to nelson eddy she had a nice soprano even as a child br br but it's you see the show for
