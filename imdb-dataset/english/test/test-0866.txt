<START> this movie totally sucked don't even rent it you'll hate it the plot didn't make sense the characters sucked and why was that penguin trying to get the pebble anyway if that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty pebble than the relationship would not be based on love only on money i very much disliked this movie hate is such a strong word and penguins cant fly even if they believe than they can do it they cant p s i am not who you think i am
<START> based on a ray bradbury story a professional photographer brian kerwin returns to his modest home near a tiny desert town where most of the citizens wishes he stayed away a lonely boy jonathan latches onto him for the attention and the two witness the landing of an alien craft in the rocky region of the desert the aliens turn themselves into the images of townspeople kerwin must convince evacuation of the town and falls in love with the young boy's mother elizabeth pena acting is pretty shallow the story line is no worse than some others this movie leaves you feeling that you got shorted on a decent ending supporting cast includes howard morris dean norris and mickey jones
<START> this was gene kelly's breakthrough and that alone makes it memorable throw in rita hayworth as his love interest and comedian phil silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser which is exactly how it turned out br br kelly plays danny mcguire a nightclub owner in brooklyn brooklyn is always the wrong side of the tracks in '40s films whose star attraction and love interest is rusty parker rita hayworth rita is lovely and even plays a dual role as rusty and grandmother rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of john otto kruger who romanced and lost grandmother br br the plot revolves around danny cutting rusty loose to the detriment of his club because she has a chance at success that he can't give her but naturally that's not what rusty ultimately wants because as usual in films of that time the right guy is the only thing on the girl's mind there are no surprises but everybody does their thing well br br kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window he was the master at that sort of dance and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once the melodrama gets a bit thick and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two but kelly takes this film to the next level this was before he became a mega star and too smooth perhaps for his own good an underlying edge of rawness to his character lends it a believable and almost wistful air br br kelly's character in the 1980 xanadu also was named danny mcguire this film was the beginning that film the end of a terrific run for a dancing genius clearly this film meant a lot to him highly recommended
<START> i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher both have delivered less than memorable performances films while the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment the specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job responsibility to save lives at sea the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowing i haven't seen such angry seas since the perfect storm co star clancy brown hbo's carnivale great to see him again played the captain of the coast guard's alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins the film wonderfully and finally gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard it had the audience applauding at the end

<START> remember before there was sidney there was dudley br br dudley digges is barely recalled today because his heyday as a fixture in sound movies was the late 1920s and through the 1930s except for one major performance the ship's good natured if tipsy doctor in the 1935 mutiny on the bounty most of his films are barely revived more's the pity because he was a wonderful actor in 1931 he played casper gutman the original actor to play that villain opposite ricardo cortez's sam spade in the first the maltese falcon similarly about the same time he played the recording angel in leslie howard's version of outward bound the same role that sidney greenstreet tackled in between two worlds a decade later br br digges could be likable and lovable that ship's doctor again or detestable in china seas as the judgmental first mate sneering at poor lewis stone but then proving he's as big a coward in a moment of crisis he held his own against paul robeson in the emperor jones he is the chinese freedom fighter working with gary cooper in the general died at dawn digges could do anything br br here he is mr thompson the hypocritical and thieving warden of a reform school that frankie darro and his friends are sent to for committing a robbery and injuring a greek american store owner it is the latest incident for most of them digges is as bad here as in china seas but it is a close thing to totally dislike him he's able to somehow transcend his roles more later about that br br darro has a gang of urban delinquents including a jewish boy and farina from our gang as pointed out in another review it is a prototype of the bowery boys we see them shake down car owners to pay them to watch and protect their autos when one guy won't do it they calmly wreck his car the snatch and grab robbery at the store of the greek american is also rather graphically shown his skull getting fractured when pushed br br the boys are rounded up and brought before stern but decent judge arthur byron who realizes that he can't leave the kids with their parents the parents are unable to watch them or are incompetent unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence a jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son stereotype father and the an italian father whose willingness to cooperate gets his son out of going to the reform school br br once there the boys find the regime oppressive occasionally one of the guards or the nurse madge evans tries to speak up for them but digges has no time for coddling his is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves unfortunately digges and his bookkeeper partner are greedy they have been serving inferior food to the boys and pocketing the profit br br one day a new official comes from the state to look at the reform school it's jimmy cagney who is a hack ward whose gang got the vote out for edward maxwell as a reward he could not get the park commissioner post cagney was made an assistant school inspector he is supported by his hanger on pal and factotum allan jenkins in his first warner brother film br br the irony is that if digges were a bit more careful cagney would probably have let him continue running things but cagney arrives to see darro brought to digges for fighting the warden and have had problems about respect earlier and digges now intends to punish darro who flees but get seriously injured by barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip cagney stops digges and lets evans treat injuries and she explains the reality of the situation to cagney and her own idea of real reformatory reform of the boys by building up trust in them with responsibility br br the film follows this to the end showing that cagney and evans are on the right path turning the reformatory as a republic for the boys to run properly this leads to conflict with digges whose profiteering is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies but the scheme is derailed when cagney himself finds he may be in serious trouble with the law digges sees his opportunity and fully takes it but then he goes too far far more than he ever bargained for br br the 1930s had many films showing kids taking steps to right wrongs and change things darro appeared in such as wild boys of the road cecil b de mille did this day and age where the kids teach a lesson to a gangster played by charles bickford that scares the hell out of him so it went in the 1930s the mayor of hell reaches a similar intensity of vengeance and juvenile justice seeking but that's the one problem of the film character is a and hypocrite so we never really cheer for him yet if he wasn't a thief we might go along with his view even if it is counter productive the scenes at the start of darro and his gang preying on people actually make the harshness digges would follow seem fairly understandable even if his thieving ways are not also he has one moment when he's justifiably angry at cagney at that point in hiding from his own clash with the law giving orders over a phone from long distance to a befuddled digges when digges learns what's actually happened he is justifiably furious at cagney lecturing him about proper behavior it is the closest thing to making mr thompson sympathetic in this fine movie
<START> the cast of all that returns for good humor in the good burger a place similar to an old fashioned fast food restaurant the comedy is terrific the fun is non stop and though clichÃ© is a passer for kid and family comedy br br a movie for all ages this movie is meant to enjoy laugh and pretty much a lazy movie for a rainy day as that's what i'd save this movie for a rainy day usa aired it today and since i know that the cast of all that is in it i thought that it might be a bit of a chuckle burner but in good fun as keenan thompson and kel mitchell probably one of the best young duos of that time were terrific together the pieces came together and everything worked out and it made it into good family fun together with some lazy day work to get off the bad day br br may i take your order
<START> i thought this movie was great if you didn't take it too seriously just sit back and enjoy hilary swank in all her greatness and laugh when the monks go to boston ma i also think this movie has a great message about self control and inner strength plus mr was so sweet i wish he'd teach me karate
<START> we can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world br br those who understand and those who do not those who understand put this movie to its grave along with hackers while those who do enjoy this movie for the sake that none of this crap could happen ever br br for a movie to attempt to be a modern movie with fiction applied to it it has failed horribly only a old and below can enjoy and only and up could be scared to have their identity taken it losses out on the main market for a value i watch it now it is more boring than when it was first released
<START> i know that was a goofy movie but i enjoyed it immensely it's one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says bill murray i almost always like movies involving the underdog and this movie has more underdogs than you can count it's overall a kind movie some of the adults are not wrapped tightly but the laughter is accepting rather than brutal like so many teen movies these days the rich kids across the lake take a beating but no one i know minded at all i never went to camp but i did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the bits and tricks ran true they were even understated at times but i'm sure that was an accident the cast performed well with bill murray showing hints of what he would become it's not groundhog day or broken flowers but hey a good goofy laugh should be appreciated these days but then it just doesn't matter
<START> this film brought me to tears i have to say that if i did not have a beautiful husband at home i would ask this beautiful piece of art to marry me aaron carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star while timothy barton writes quick and witty dialogue that only furthers the genius of carter's performance kyle is pretty gay but his performance was nothing less than spectacular he is also very handsome and cute i'm thinking about asking him out on a date and giving him a very sweet goodnight gift br br if you would like to discuss this film in the future please contact me br br nick vassar class of 2012 malibu california malibu west
<START> hey this ralf seems to knows a lot about people we have nine women and nine men taking part in a speed dating event each person has five minutes to talk to each opposite a good idea to make a movie out of these conversations and even better it works very very well the dialog is witty original and authentic each person is subtly characterized without falling into the clichÃ© trap something that is unusual for german movies remember all these years we germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies such as workaholic or br br but now the time has come for young german directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are entertaining and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time the timing of is good too although it presents mainly dialog it keeps the tension and interest after a while you actually become curious to see how this man and that woman would do some of the participants meet later on for a two some it's fun to see them interacting together in real life of course the film has a few drawbacks it's not very cinematic but can such a movie be the musical soundtrack could have been better but all this is only marginal br br the most important thing about this movie we have some damn good actors here imagine this all of them are still pretty unknown even here in germany most were derived from the munich or bavarian theater scene but i predict that out of the 18 main actors at least 11 will quickly become very well known in the movie and tv scene over here it's great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces well done br br for those who want to read more here's a rundown of all 18 actors spoilers br br sebastian weber silent waters are deep memorize his flower garden monologue you can win any woman's heart with this one br br anna a hell of a woman every time she opens her mouth you can't help but laugh and feel good listen how she pronounces asshole and calls the pink shirt guy a br br felix the from above is fun to watch the inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around his looks somewhat reminded me of flo weber of stiller br br katharina schubert this woman has everything love hope despair beauty her do you want children scene is a classic a great actress of whom we will hear again no doubt br br david now is this guy a loser or not almost as authentic as paul giamatti in sideways i hope this is not method acting br br julia the good looking woman in the circle julia used to play theater in my hometown kudos i think she will appear in many tv series to come br br martin the revolutionary guy catches the cutest and most conventional woman in the end would you like to share a taxi with this guy br br von she gave a stunning performance in last year her trance like performance in this movie is no less see her beautiful face and hear her dirty laugh the best scene in the movie belongs to her br br matthias i know these write down everything guys back from school i'm not sure whether the hot blond got her allergic reaction because of him or his cat portrayal of such a chicken is outstanding br br the sister in law of my ex girl friend was the same talker like her the day i met her was the only day in my life i needed tranquilizers so bad here br br thomas the nice and desperate guy in the circle has a comical talent that is way better than most so called comedians on tv br br lisa wagner the victim of sebastian's flower garden metaphor lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy her story made me feel good and sad at the same time wow br br oliver the good looking man in the circle no wonder he catches julia in the end these two really fit together i think he will appear in many tv series to come br br julia the cute conventional woman i hope she won't be underrated julia's face changes from naive to hurt to furious are great br br stephan the nature boy from likes cooking eating Â and good sex watch the body language between him and the hot blond usually plays politician on stage br br anja the bargain girl has some good moments but beg your pardon fails like most actors in playing a drunk on screen br br christian plays the arrogant and narcissistic guy couldn't believe that this very actor owns two art house cinemas in munich br br plays the girl who sleeps with every man around i'm sure many male visitors will go for her i have heard she can do dramatic roles as well so i'm curious
<START> rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion what makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real it's almost hard to remember that it's only a movie this is by far madeline stowe and alan performance of their careers the film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit the only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it i have yet to see it other than on laserdisc this truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on dvd it really is that good
<START> southern cross written and directed by james is a waste of good celluloid and actor's efforts a formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it's promise which this film does not it is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past it is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains follow them this was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other it makes one believe that somebody told there was a ghost town in the chilean foothills and he said oh great lets do a shoot out scene there br br don't even waste your rental money on this it is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama
<START> i admit i have been a fan of harrison ford for many many years now so it didn't surprise me that i enjoyed his performance here but i also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done i don't know whether i buy into kristin scott thomas as a congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman i took notice of her in the first mission impossible although her part was small she stuck out on the screen br br here her and ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash they are seated together and this is where the plot takes off apparently ford a police detective in wash d c discovers that his wife was having an affair he further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a new england congresswoman br br the story takes on many subplots as ford and thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages the uncovering of and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one br br i think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable
