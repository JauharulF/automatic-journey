<START> i just love this show it's so funny and cool is such a hilarious and interesting character i love him he's the thing that makes this show what it is although and are so funny and charming too everything about this show is great for me because it always manages to make me laugh no matter if it's only once an episode it's just so funny and all the characters are so lovable and cool it makes the show worth the time to watch unlike some crap on disney channel give this show a try next time it's on if you've seen the movie and even if you haven't seen the movie you'll find this to be very enjoyable anyway so go ahead
<START> an obvious cash in on the insert monster here on a plane gimmick flight of the living dead is about what you'd expect it to be br br the film has little or no plot which is what you'd expect from a film of this type although it is fun in parts i must say the zombie action is particularly entertaining once the film picks up it never stops the pacing is solid br br the practical special effects are pretty good but the cgi is terrible and distracting br br the ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel let's hope that doesn't come to fruition br br if you're a die hard fan of the zombie sub genre of horror films i'd recommend it to you it's worth at least one watch however if you're just an avid fan of the genre leave it on the shelf br br 3 10
<START> please don't kill me i'm just an actor can you play dead it's difficult to describe this show it's like a crime dramedy where the bad cop is an ass literally what's great about the show is some of perfectly awful one liners cracking out such gems as adios blimp mcgee provides some great laughs at points sadly at other times the show seems to drag along at a slow pace making it almost hard to watch this is definitely the kind of show you'll love or hate there's essentially no it's not the best show on adult swim but it has some strong points it's worth looking into just to see if you enjoy it i know i did
<START> any person claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it otherwise i can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title br br the fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable instead of casting franco nero as the ninja they could hire some experienced martial artist instead in any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar his kicks and punches are lame br br there's enough of old action movies with good action this is just a waste of time
<START> a little while ago i stumbled upon this dvd while browsing netflix and with such an impressive cast decided to give it a go br br never before have i seen a movie try to be a new version of an existing great movie scarface and failing so spectacularly br br the main issue seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be in scarface tony montana was the self proclaimed bad guy his spectacular rise and eventual downfall wasn't sad it was a great and the only logical ending to someone who lived such a life br br damian as director writer and lead actor sees kilo as some sort of hero or at least a complicated guy however he doesn't want to do the grunt work of creating a realistic sympathetic character he was raised by a white mother except for the six months of his childhood where his father a gangster himself showed him his life for reasons never fully explained or even really mentioned he decides he wants to be a drug dealer and actually drives to the bad part of town approaches two dealers and says hey i'd like to buy some drugs he drops his father's name and in apparently no time they are not only rich the two guys who are supplying him are acting to him for reasons again never explained br br wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to prison when a police informant lies about him however since he's dealt large quantities of drugs before why should one feel sympathy for him going to jail for it this time the most obvious case of wanting to be the good guy is in his prison execution of a white supremacist rapist played by gary busey in scarface tony montana kills someone in prison because he pretty much has to in order to elevate himself it's done he moves on but in this case they ham handedly have to make busey not only a rapist pedophile but also a white supremacist a little overkill don't you think i won't go into detail in this regard too much more but their desperate message of please like me i'm a complicated gangster fails on every level try as they might i didn't feel bad conflicted or sympathetic when his buddies are killed following a shootout his wife is also killed shortly after she called him out on being a lousy father and during an attempted escape when he decided it'd be ok to ride right next to a car filled with gunmen while his wife is in the car and his eventual demise br br suffice it to say his acting can be fairly summed up as lousy his only achievement bringing the term wooden to starry new heights busey should be credited for actually putting effort into his ridiculous role tiny lister did well stacy keach is playing his warden from prison break role robert wagner is coasting for a paycheck faye dunaway while a touch dramatic still turns in a performance better than this movie deserved brad dourif is in the film for about two minutes and does what he can and to give the film credit it does one up scarface in one way jennifer tilly now holds the title of most ridiculous attempt at a hispanic accent sorry robert loggia in short this movie had an interesting premise but a poor story arc unsympathetic characters and hit or miss performances i'd advise mr to ease up on the forced sympathy next time really we don't need to like your character we just need to be interested better luck next time
<START> if you live in the suburbs are relatively well off financially and do not really have much contact with the city life of england then this is the comedy for you not something a mass audience would go for but if you're like these characters they show you'll love it to pieces overall this is a comedy that the snobs at the bbc will sit back and laugh at for their pleasure and only a select few of the publics comparing it to bbc comedys like only fools and horses fawlty towers black adder and other classics this series tends to drift away from the bbc's regular product to the audience and deliver to somewhat of a folk culture
<START> the trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised good campy fun with lots of very good looking naked broads if you were expecting a major hollywood movie with major stars stellar budgets and mpaa tamed money shots you will be very disappointed br br however if you are a fan of the old b movies with unknown but very good looking young stars that act amazingly well given the material some hokey but surprisingly well done special effects and very tight naked nubile bodies this movie is almost heaven
<START> blond main character always believes in everyone and when you stick together you can do anything shy guy best friend with curly hair rip off of wants to be a movie director has a secret crush on zoey spanish best friend rip off of miranda weird smart girl quinn rip off of and the popular stock up prep logan rip off of kate and little brother max annoying rip off of matt br br zoey is the semi popular girl with 2 best friends the only thing it's missing is the funny little cartoon lizzie mcguire has and hillary duff was a lot cuter jamie lynn spears looks more like a tooth pick in a tube top
<START> i watched this movie probably more than 20 times the jokes are now 10 15 years old but every time i watch it it makes me fall off my chair two of the finest actor salman khan and aamir khan plays the lead roles here even if aamir khan is a much better actor and got the better role smart guy in the movie salman khan matches and sometimes perform even better as the dumb guy all the characters are memorable this movie is filled with hilarious one liners and funny situations a little too silly probably don't try to look for logic in this movie let your brain relax for some time i promise it will be an experience to remember
<START> this contains some spoiler information but the movie is not worth watching anyway br br why ellen barkin and peta wilson agreed to be a part of this debacle by writer director damian harris is beyond me the story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques which includes going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them the tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients and he sleeps with them all br br even more over the top is the notion that the female victims to a horrendous s m crime belong to a large yet secret group of s m lesbian executives br br full of bad editing and continuity errors the film is sterile in all of its ritzy locations including barkin's detective salary apartment and the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep br br damian is a bad writer and a bad director he tried and failed miserably to create a atmosphere at times furthermore he couldn't get ellen barkin to give 110 i firmly believe she realized the film was pathetic and gave up trying br br standouts were peta wilson who wasted time studying with a dominatrix for the part the highly under rated character actor marshall bell gave his absolute best as always br br and since damian couldn't deliver on any level it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters br br most importantly he doesn't know much about the real world of bdsm and chose to create the typical hollywood reality of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous br br save your time money and braincells and pass this one by
<START> this film is my favorite comedy of all time and i have seen a lot of comedies first of all i should not this film had no script just a storyboard the dialogue is almost completely written by the actors which makes this film absolutely the cast is one of the best comedic you will ever see the story is about the dog show in philadelphia and some of the contestants in them parker posey shines and is absolutely great this is one of those films that most of the laughing comes from the absolute pathetic ness of the characters
<START> on watching this film i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity karen carpenter was a carefree but very unconfident young lady whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs as with all celebrities of today they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks styles etc this had a huge effect on karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight which eventually caused her death this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching but on starting to view it then i was hooked in the same way that the tina turner story does then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life the acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining br br i would recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet watched it it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged
<START> oh where the hell should i begin give a brief summary of the story no either you've already heard it or don't want to either way it sucks much like the movie i happen to be a semi large horror movie aficionado and i must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsily executed movies i've ever had the displeasure of viewing br br the script is horrendously stupid the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest all of those torture scenes would have been a lot more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet capt howdy how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them first off they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they don't even know and second we don't even know their damn names why the hell should i care if they live or die not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards capt howdy after he's been reformed please i was cheering when he got his just deserts he deserved them hell he deserved worse also we're forced to sit through a pointless sequence lifted directly from the silence of the lambs and here it's done horribly of course he's gonna give them a false address and even if he had given them the real one don't you think he'd be waiting and not piercing some guy's johnson upstairs retarded br br then there's the dialogue everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid the dead are so dreadfully dead when they're dead what the hell kind of crap is that dee snider at one point says knowledge is power well if that's true this film has absolutely no power whatsoever br br then there's the plot holes yes i know this is a horror film well wannabe horror film but damn you could drive a semi truck into these holes first off these have got to be the dumbest cops i have ever seen ever i mean dear god these guys are morons call for backup idiots second how the hell did that ring fall out of captain nose this piercing expert guy says that's the biggest one i've ever seen but if it's so damn big how the hell could it have fallen out so easily did capt howdy just leave it at the crime scene because he wanted to get caught they sure didn't make it seem like he did also they would never release capt howdy and i know that for a damn fact he would be in jail for the rest of his life and there's no getting around this much less let him return to his old house where he killed tortured everybody impossible and implausible br br and now the acting dear god did these people suck linda is the only thing good in this film she's poised and amazing too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap amy smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence even the usually entertaining robert englund is underused and ineffective here dee snider plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever i never felt threatened scared or intimidated i'd rather have seen dee snider in alexis arquette's role in bride of chucky it would have been so much more fun to see this talent less hack get it by that lovable psycho doll br br dee snider just plain sucks he can't act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he can't write did he write this damn movie in his sleep and he's obviously dumber than freaking jessica simpson this film is just a way for dee snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about self mutilation and modern primitives and blah blah blah either it's been done before or it just didn't need to be done i was bored throughout the whole damn thing br br the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fails miserably it doesn't manage to scare shock or disturb in any shape way or form this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid br br gets a 0 out of 10 avoid at any and all costs not enjoyable in the slightest
<START> possibly the finest moment of tv at least in my memory as millions could watch shakespeare's gripping kings cycle richard ii richard iii play out on prime time tv i believe it was on friday nights no word was left out and the plays awoke in me who was then in elementary school a thirst for history and a hunger for shakespeare and drama br br let's see these reissued on dvd what a set this would be
<START> this movie is poorly written hard to follow and features bad performances and dialog from leads jason patric and jennifer jason leigh the premise believable but weak undercover narcotics agent succumbs to the drug underworld deserved better than this lili fini zanuck flop the competent supporting cast sam elliott william sadler others was not enough to save this film br br in addition this movie also contains the absolute worst love scene in cinema br br moreover the soundtrack is vastly overrated specifically the revolting sappy without substance tears in heaven by the otherwise legendary eric clapton br br rush is wholly unenjoyable from beginning to end br br 2 of 10
