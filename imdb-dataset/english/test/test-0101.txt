<START> don't get me wrong i assumed this movie would be stupid i honestly did i gave it an incredibly low standard to meet the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going different story for a different time as i began watching i noticed something this film was terrible now there are two types of terrible there's freddy vs jason terrible where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is and then there is a movie like this the cat in the hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me as i watched the first bit of it not only was i bored senseless but i felt as though i had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie mike myers is usually brilliant i love the majority of his work but something in this movie didn't click one of the things that the director producers writers whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book red black white on any character but the cat coincidentally or not they also refused to capture any of the original and i hate to use this word but it fits zaniness of the original the book was like an ice cream sunday colorful and delicious and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust br br avoid this like a leprous prostitute
<START> usually alan alda plays characters that are too soft and overly verbal it's probably how he really lives this time he fits the character though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered br br the 1971 prison riot and the state of new york's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event only a few journalists have told the true story this film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the riot revolt had a major impact on this country maybe the movie will stimulate someone to research the history br br i can't remember a feature movie made from the perspective of the prisoners though there is a great pbs piece with the actual survivors participants the perspective of the guards held hostage is explored in against the wall with kyle maclachlan samuel l jackson clarence williams iii and frederic forrest br br back in the day we shouted it was nice to hear it in the movie brought back memories br br the worst part of the movie are the natural wigs morris chestnut and the other african americans must wear it would have been easy for these people to grow a 'fro
<START> great film a very worthy 7 10 br br tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit temporarily look who we the british amongst others are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the 80s br br this film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story however once the main objective is achieved i e ridding the communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten about br br this film was good it was a well deserved 7 10 it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well although being a good film i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good us v evil russia isn't your thing
<START> yesterday i finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie my knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds of the trailer but i had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to increase br br as i saw the movie those untied pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing with some apparently inexplicable details but in the end everything is disclosed as a simple succession of events of bad luck sorte nula in portuguese above everything i felt that the story made sense and everything fits in it's place properties of a good script br br i must also mention the soundtrack which helps the creation of an amazing environment br br and if you think of the resources fernando fragata used to make this film i believe it will make many hollywood producers envious
<START> it didn't take too long after halloween had kicked off the slasher boom for the category to be cursed by continuous mediocrity as early as 1983 the genre was already struggling to release more than three decent offerings per year and by '88 the stalk and slash flick had become pretty much the whipping boy of horror cinema by that time major studios were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction which left it up to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that john carpenter had created although there was still an impressive number of features hitting shelves in 88 most of them were weakly produced and taken as a whole they were eminently unappealing with that said there were a couple of gems amongst the rubble scott spiegel's intruder in its uncut form was a superb gross out classic whilst evil dead trap proved that the cycle had not yet completely run out of style and panache william lustig's maniac cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later dead girls and mirage proved to be the last beguiling breaths of life in the ailing category br br it was the continual release of schlock like berserker blood lake and rush week that cursed the slasher movie to eight years of obscurity it finally took the big budgeted flamboyance of wes craven's scream to provide the necessary resuscitation having not heard anything about demon warrior before i came across it unexpectedly i instantly assumed that it was part of the low brow trash that led to the downfall of the slasher phase but with that said the movie boasts an intriguing premise that sits comfortably beside scalps and camping del terrore as another welcome addition to the native american influenced catalogue br br a truck pulls up on a woodland road and out step two laughably dramatised rednecks the hillbilly are only on screen for around for ten seconds and then they are murdered by an unseen menace next we meet a troupe of five young adults that are heading to the same location for a spot of shotgun target practice on some of the local wildlife the area is owned by neil willard and has been passed down through three generations of his family his grandfather stole the land from an indian medicine man that was rumoured to have left a curse on the property according to legend every ten years a demon warrior with an extreme hatred for mankind stalks the forest reaping revenge on those he deems responsible for the pilfering of the tribe's home it wouldn't be much fun if those myths were a falsehood so regular as clockwork a maniacal assassin turns up with a taste for blood will the kids be able to stop this phantom br br demon warrior is best described as a bigger budgeted but still woefully cheap re imaging of fred olen ray's scalps the bogeymen from both films are virtually identical and the director even throws in a sequence to confirm my suspicions things start promisingly with some crisp friday the 13th style first person cinematography and a couple of shock jolts that were composed with finesse by director frank patterson thomas did a good job with the photography and the tribal drum score makes a refreshing change from the more traditional late eighties synthesizer rubbish flourishes of suspense are juxtaposed with a couple of credible directorial embellishments and there are even a few attempts at humour the killer looked successfully creepy in demon attire and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main murder weapon was a deft touch from the director br br fred olen ray's notorious slasher was notable for its stark and credibly unsettling atmosphere unfortunately despite being produced on twice the budget demon warrior never comes close to the film that it so desperately emulates rumor has it that the majority of the actors were drafted from the texas university and were not even paid for their inclusion in the feature so of course it goes without saying that the dramatics are appropriately abysmal i especially enjoyed the hilarious john Â an native american don't ask that portrays about as much emotion as the trees in the forest that surrounded him warrior started with some credible glimpses of panache from the director that actually led me to believe that this could be a welcome inclusion to the slasher index unfortunately the poisonous cocktail of heinous acting and an ending plucked directly from seriously changed the initial plan i had in mind for a rating it's a shame that the dramatics were so scraped from the bottom of the thespian barrel because at times demon warrior showed flashes of potential br br all in all movie is a mixed bag of ideas Â some of them were good but mostly they were staggeringly mediocre because this was released at a time when the slasher genre had been watered down to avoid the happy censors there's really no gore worth mentioning even the sequence is relatively tame compared to olen ray's graphic depiction demon warrior has the odd moment of credibility but not often enough to warrant a purchase not as bad as the aforementioned berserker blood lake et al but not really that good
<START> few people realize it but there was world literature in the ancient world before the greeks came on the scene besides the literary remains that are in the old testament of the jews there were considerable works from mesopotamia and egypt the summit of the former were the religious poetry and the epic of gilgamesh the egyptians produced many poems but there main addition was a tale of adventure of a traveler and physician called the story of it is from this work actually a fragment that we don't know the ending of that the novel the egyptian came from br br the story is unique as is the movie the egyptian was a best seller in the early 1950s and darryl zanuck decided to take a chance making it yes he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend bella as as well as the rest of the cast victor mature edmund purdom peter ustinov michael wilding and gene tierney but he was aware that these films rarely made large box office one can chalk up this as an example of zanuck trying something different br br the number of movies that deal with ancient egypt are very small land of the the egyptian the ten commandments both de mille versions moses holy moses cleopatra the mummy all versions the scorpion king if there are 20 films about ancient egypt it's is tremendous but the egyptian is unique while the second ten commandments discusses the great pharoah ii yul brynner and his father seti i cedric hardwicke and the films on cleopatra deal with her few other names of ancient egypt crop up in film greatest pharoah was iii who conquered most of the known middle east of the era of b c e or so no film about him has appeared nor of his usurping predecessor history's first great female ruler but the only known pharoah who attempted a religious revolution that approached what the jews and later the christians attempted a type of monotheism is the subject of the egyptian this is pharoah br br in reality was practicing a personal form of monotheism that was not meant for public consumption but it angered the priestly class who worshiped rather than due to our uncertain historic records although official records the tel el letters are quite complete as far as they survive we do not know if the pharoah was killed in a palace coup or not however he died he was succeeded by a young brother or son of his whose name is better recalled than any other pharoah except br br this film is actually quite good as far as it goes wilding makes a good natured who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer is supposed to be mature is good as the ambitious and outside the film ultimately successful future pharoah tierney and purdom do well in their lead parts and ustinov is good as friend also good is ms in a large supporting part in a wonderful cameo is john carridine as a philosophical grave robber the film is certainly worthy of viewing as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of ancient egypt
<START> greetings again from the darkness based on the mega best seller from author the film provides us a peak at the ugliness of post russia invaded afghanistan and the terror of the taliban director marc foster adds a gem to his resume which already includes monster's ball finding neverland and stranger than fiction br br the story of young friends amir and hassan and the unknown bond they share into the next generation this is a story of honor and courage and loyalty and is an unusual coming of age tale some great scenes of the boys when they are kids and then a couple of truly amazing scenes as amir returns as an adult to find hassan's imprisoned son br br this is tight compelling story telling with a message the acting is solid throughout with no one actor stealing the screen although not a pleasant story to watch unfold it is certainly meaningful and heart felt plus a quick shot of midnight oil playing in the pool hall is a welcome gift
<START> i really liked get shorty but this movie was completely disappointing as a sequel first of all travolta does not in any way resemble the chili palmer from get shorty he merely half assed this performance as he has done in all of his more recent movies he totally isn't smooth or have the mobster presence about him that makes you kinda root for him throughout the movie it just seems like travolta rolled out of bed and decided he was good to go for acting in this movie the plot just wasn't exciting or clever there really aren't any highlights that happen the only thing that resembled entertainment was watching christina perform and the rock was funny but anyways long story short this movie was trash and i had to force myself just to get through it
<START> this movie is a masterpiece of brilliant acting and timely patriotic sense of pride in america the nazi saboteurs of the 40's are replaced by the middle east terrorists of today the intent is the same to terrorize disrupt lives destroy property and kill americans we see a wrongly accused barry bob cummings on the lamm trying to uncover the real nazi terrorists plot meeting the beautiful pat priscilla lane and together they travel to new york chasing the devious and evil saboteur fry played expertly by norman lloyd along the way they encounter the also very sinister otto kruger playing the leader of the nazi saboteur ring but disguised as a distinguished model citizen where barry seeking saboteur fry takes him into his confidence only to handed over to the local law enforcement he escapes meets a kindly blind gentleman and his niece enter priscilla lane from there barry and pat travel to soda city cal run into the west coast saboteur gang heading east they trail ends up in the mansion of a unlikely new york socialite the going gets tough when the bad guys kidnap pat from barry and he goes after her with reckless abandon the movie climax is the famous statue of liberty scene which is excerpted in many compilations this is a true blue patriotic flag waving performance at it's best and what is wrong with that see this movie if you don't see another hitchcock film you will be swept up in the patriotic and the love interest between cummings and lane will make you wish they had been paired in other movies she is the beautiful ideal girl next door often underrated her talent shows through in this film see it and go bless america
<START> as a kid i loved the song never smile at a crocodile and if i found myself in this state of affairs which is actually inspired by true events smiling would be the last thing on my mind from the opening set up i've never been so entrenched caught up and finally exhausted like i was when watching this limited budget independent australian horror film about three people in northern territory trapped in a swamp with a very conniving crocodile waiting in the water below them what really brought the film alive was how realistic it managed to be in transporting the fear and uncertainty of the characters' situation to the audience semi documentary camera work with a eerie backdrop and authentic performances effectively take you out of your comfort zone what we get is a patient survival tale than just a bloody all out creature feature onslaught think of open water 2003 where its budget and time restraint made sure it would stay low key but this minimal barrier enhanced the experience br br the slow grinding story might be black and white but it never seemed to become disposable or succumb to formulaic patterns well not largely and the connection between the characters were emotionally engaging even with a bare straight forward script although you can say less is more with the actions and expressions illuminating the lingering thoughts plaguing their minds the ordeal is utterly terrifying because the threat is very alive and never seems to loosen up this is what drives the film's chaotic adrenaline and in which it lasts even when its kept buried through to the very end br br writers directors andrew and david economical guidance alienates and smartly strings along the viewer with its taut pacing and harrowing psychological traits in certain patches the notch goes up with pressure induced suspense and startling images the way the night sequence is executed is immensely chilling and pulsating the menacing crocodile manipulative toys with its fresh meat in a distressingly suspenseful approach sure some moments felt unlikely but never does it get in the way or distract sound fx is the key and at times the lack of any just eats away at you may's musical score is unassuming and doesn't really enter the mixture much but when it does it builds an organic sounding quality the cinematography of john is beautifully devised and rapidly aggressive when the mood changes it was always on the move and claustrophobic but none of this jerky movements the editing was sharply handled and the effects were professionally catered by superbly combing live crocodile footage br br something like this production would also have to rely on its cast to sell to the story in a believable manner and they do it diana glenn andy and especially are persuasively good a lot of the responsibility falls on and she strongly delivers with an inspired turn now this item might cop some comparisons with another killer crocodile film rogue 2007 but the two couldn't be any different in what they want to be and how they end up if i had to pick though i'm leaning more towards this outing for its sheer involvement to snap at you br br a remarkable effort on all fronts with everyone involved showing potential to really look out for
<START> i liked this show from the first episode i saw which was the rhapsody in blue episode for those that don't know what that is the zan going insane and becoming 10 ep best visuals and special effects i've seen on a television series nothing like it anywhere
<START> the only riddle in this film was how it ever got made the british film industry needs to make films people actually want to watch and not look to get money a'la bbc to keep in their life style they have been accustomed to with doing nothing for it br br the film was every thing wrong with british films it relied on stereotypes it had to be about a london were people were either posh and corrupt gangsters or gawd blimey eel types the story script was just pathetically weak to the extent when the police man pulled out his phone and the ring tone was the sweeney theme i just expected it the whole film was a happy shopper sweeney minder rip off br br the priceless manuscript i noted got left behind and lost on a few occasions and is something even i with my limited street wiseness wouldn't carry around in my breast pocket every where to the beach and fights etc saying that vinnie jones is likable which is about the only thing in the film poor bloke br br when derek jacobi walked into the water at the end because he was dickens oh my god what a load of crap and i am being positive here
<START> written by science fiction veterans gerry and sylvia anderson this space fantasy is aptly directed by robert parrish experienced american astronaut colonel glenn ross roy thinnes agrees to a manned flight to the far side of the sun the mission is to be controlled by jason webb patrick and his euro sec space agency scientist john kane ian hendry will accompany ross the two will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same identical orbit as earth except it is always hidden on the other side of the sun ross is the only one to make it back to earth and has a very incredible story to tell special effects may be better than the story line nonetheless fun to watch the cast also includes lynn loring loni von george sewell and herbert lom
<START> this is one of the very best films i've seen in ages it's right up there with the likes of trainspotting and pulp fiction it just epitomises teenage culture today the soundtrack is absolutely amazing overseen by pete tong it's a must see
<START> with batman returns tim burton succumbed to an important priority in american cinema giving a sequel to a blockbuster three years after the most successful movie of the year batman 1989 here comes the hero of gotham city again for the pleasure of many spectators like its predecessor batman returns enjoyed an enormous commercial success tim burton made batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the joker did little to improve the image of gotham city indeed violence and corruption still exist and here the second word is epitomized by max christopher walken and the penguin danny de vito these two crooks who are eager to take control of gotham city are going to make life difficult for batman his task will be more difficult with the apparition of catwoman br br tim burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie it means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first batman but he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that if in the movie of 1989 burton had focused on bruce wayne batman's psychology here it's the penguin that obviously interested him the director attempted to make of him very well acted by de vito an ambiguous character on one hand he's full of bad intentions previously quoted but on the other hand he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man br br batman returns also appears as crazier than its predecessor especially with the cast i think of michÃ¨le pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as catwoman besides at the time when i'm writing this review it makes me remember that a new version of catwoman is currently at the cinema but given the bad reviews 3 out of 10 on imdb it is sure that her performer halle berry must pale into insignificance beside pfeiffer br br ultimately this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it enables to develop tim burton's peculiar style we also still find his taste for the strange and the gothic concerning batman's other adaptations for the screen you can skip them batman forever 1995 and batman and robin 1997 are no good i heard that christopher nolan was shooting the beginning of the batman story and it was to be released next year will it match tim burton's works
