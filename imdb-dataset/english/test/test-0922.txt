<START> anyone who complains about peter jackson making movies too long should sit through this cbs event there's about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots featuring bland by the book tv drama clichÃ©s bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies so i'm not going to complain about that silly science can be fun to watch if it's executed in an amusing fashion what kills this movie is it's 10 subplots all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot the one character that is entertaining to watch in category 6 is tornado tommy despite being a very annoying stereotype br br note that i also didn't bother commenting on special effects their quality should come as no surprise br br not recommended
<START> this could have been so much better than it turned out tom pittman gives a good performance and some of the older actors do well with what they have to work with but it just doesn't work br br first the actors are much too old to play high school students especially howard vince he looks about thirty second it's hard to sympathize with poor marv especially since betty is not all that hot to start with br br spoilers the ending is so strange it looks like the director intended for character to get shot but there are no gunshots he's just knocked to the cement where he lays there until the ambulance drivers pick him up and place him on a stretcher face down what were his injuries a skinned knee goofy vince has just shot his girlfriend dead without any remorse whatsoever yet he simply shoves marv to the ground and rushes off despite the fact that he makes no secret of the fact that he hates the kid and to make matters even sillier marv begs the police to tell his father he's sorry duh hey marv you just got knocked around i think you will have plenty of opportunities to tell your father you're sorry in person and this writer didn't get an oscar nomination skip it unless you get to watch it on mst
<START> while the prominent and over use of the play like format is in total operation throughout the film it is not however this that lets this picture down rather it is the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious script that the film so obviously relied on a little too much with an idea that had potential the simple plot is diminished still by graham's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience the use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege as downey jr proves as usual what a gifted actor he is he shadows the two actresses in their scenes together which is constantly noticeable the pointless yet intense sex scene seems merely to exist in order to prevent the film from being too verbally expressive giving the actors a much deserved break from talking with an unsatisfying conclusion two girls and a guy has very little to recommend it other than downey jr's formidable if not out of place performance
<START> this movie should have been called the eyes of alexander and they should have done away with the bogart concept altogether the film started out with a lighthearted approach to bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face but after the first 15 30 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller where two palm size purportedly laid as eyes into a marble of alexander the great for him and seen by him right before his death so the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size but also because of the tie to the greatest conquerer the world has ever known being an expert on alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction but it makes for a good movie anyway so the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of alexander allusions in both the foreground and background which i really liked ending with a dated shark attack you couldn't go to a movie in '79 '80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience there is a yacht named alexander's father's young wife a man named alexander philip it's been about 5 years since i've seen the film so can't remember all the details some street names and many others it was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director obviously an himself put in when all is said and done the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by kind of a neat ending what would have been more fun would be if they went the indiana jones way and had an action adventure there were many many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting or instance the hand by aristotle version of the iliad that alexander kept with him all his life even on his many journeys across asia would be of incalculable value if found today olivia hussey my all time favorite b movie actress is killed off way too early and should have been the main actress throughout not the girl from the momma's and the though she was herself easy on the eyes if you can find this flick it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see olivia hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on but beyond that i'd pass on it for something more entertaining br br yours nick
<START> i somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment delivered my friends and i are fans of hk film but wow this movie has it all and by all i mean everything a movie shouldn't have underdeveloped and stereotyped characters way over the top overacting cheesy special effects talking robots no less than 20 double foot impossible situations unfunny gags and jokes elementary school premise mindless killings and too long running time for the material throw in the fact that gen x cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear quite simply if you're entertaining the idea of watching this film don't
<START> i am sorry but this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life i cannot believe that after making the first one in the series they were able to get a budget to make another not that the budget could have been much this is the least scary film i have ever watched and laughed all the way through to the end actually i can't believe we watched it to the end but i think it is because we couldn't quite believe it
<START> this is one of crichton's best books the characters of karen ross peter elliot munro and amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting complex and fast paced throughout this impressive novel br br and about 99 8 percent of that got lost in the film seriously the screenplay and the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not fathom what was good about the novel i can't fault the actors because frankly they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to crichton's original work i know good novels especially those with a science fiction edge are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original but this may be the absolute worst disparity in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever the book is really really good the movie is just dreadful
<START> as i was flipping through the channel i came to a channel it is an urban channel i saw this movie on and decided to give it a try i almost became a mass murderer due to this film i have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of dookie the lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely bad i would rather watch star crystal holy cow maybe that is not a good example the main question i have about this film is was it to be a morality film the reason why i ask is because ther was one line where this lady in a wheelchair says i would have been another gang statistic oh my head is starting to hurt after hearing that line i went into the kitchen and pulled out a knife ready to stab anyone who dared watch this movie but some sense kicked in and i just changed the channel to watch the man with the afro paint well that is all i have to say about this movie if you want to endure this pain go ahead but not recommended for those with short fuses or a bad case of
<START> awful is really all one needs to know first think of all the things that could be bad about a movie and then try to make a movie that is bad in all of these ways you will have made the state of maine should feel insulted it's much too nice a place to serve as the backdrop for such trite mindless boring schlock i'm a romantic and i always want movies about two people finding each other to succeed and i tried hard to find the good in this one it was tough very tough i couldn't find a glimmer of emotional connection among any of the characters in this exercise in humdrum dreariness except maybe in one or two of the bad guys br br maine is a good this movie is not
<START> according to milan kundera a porcelain cat holding a red rose is denying the crap well those criminals guilty of making this series probably wanted to show how to make a total opposite of the porcelain cat holding a red rose because teenaged beavis and butthead are enthusiastically from the place where the sun doesn't shine and their crappiness infects the whole stoopid series mtv has received a lot of bad mouthing from it's half nude stripper beauties while this is gathering positive reviews in imdb well newsflash to everybody your butt is cool too if you go out showing it in the middle of the winter something these two probably would do still there is no need to make a film about your butt and yes these two probably would do that too
<START> this movie was bad on so many levels the writing was horrible so even the best actors could not have made this movie watchable it's a shame because they did have some good actors in this movie i mean if anyone has seen any of the police academy movies you would know that steve guttenberg was good his character in this movie was very serious which was a big difference from characters i have seen him play before so that was a plus and i did think that steve guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie with or without the shirt you can not deny that he has a great body sexy face too loved the 5 o'clock shadow look it made him look dangerous at one part in the movie he is lying in bed without his shirt and i have to say i would have gladly jumped in there and tried to take his mind off of his problems so honestly i would watch this movie again just to fantasize
<START> the pace of this movie is quite slow it takes about 70 minutes to get katie to china which we know that she will and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up the storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes nothing surprises you i guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top br br katie a beauty that realizes that looks boys and shopping isn't everything she realizes that she can feel and see the real world touching br br the mother high strung nervous screaming mother wow very innovative that need taking care of by a strong man br br the father patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman br br the boyfriend that only wants to get into her pants br br the comedian clown chinese guy that doesn't know how to speak english properly and made a laughing stock thought hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fifties br br the nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in china that in the next moment is a carbon copy of the mother i e a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anything br br the deformed chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl because in china a third world country according to the film don't have anything and hence needs our charity gah wake up and smell what you are shoveling br br sure that there are some poverty in china but the portrayal of the aid from western countries read usa is so shallow and happy ending ish that it is sad and revolting shanghai where the movie is set is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the moment br br the chinese father that is so nice and goodhearted that in the end has one wish to be a cowboy with a white hat br br the teacher sean astin that has this really heart ripping story not that he tells without feel why sean why br br etc etc it is difficult to actually finding a real person in the entire movie br br this is nothing but a feel good movie for americans below age 15 if you want to learn anything about the world watch e g hotel rwanda instead for a better life story or coming of age movie i suggest you watch the italian cinema paradiso that won the best foreign film academy reward some years back br br the only nice thing in the movie were the small town sceneries that truly capture some not all of the beautiful chinese country side i have been there and seen some of it
<START> i must say that this has to be the best documentary i have ever seen in my life i first say the movie at my friends house and didn't get a chance to finish watching it from that point on i spent my free time trying to find the movie i never found it but on my birthday my friend who knew i had the hardest time finding the movie got it for me as present sean penn does a great job of narrating the documentary i loved how it told the story of each of the z boys and the history of dogtown i have been to venice and the surrounding area many times and had never known what had taken place until i saw the documentary i didn't get a chance to see the actual movie and i heard it was nowhere near what the documentary was i don't know if i actually want to see the movie but who knows
