<START> this film is about two female killers going on a tour to kill random men they meet br br wow baise moi just became the worst film of all time in my list the plot is crazy pointless and unnecessary the whole film is full of violence and sex and i am sure no sane parents would want to show this film to their children i don't understand what people get out of by making this film or watching this film maybe someone somewhere has their perverted desires fulfilled there is simply no excuse or reasons for the existence of this perverted and depraved piece of work br br the only consolation i offer myself is that i watched it on fast forward so that i have not wasted as much time
<START> kazuo komizu strikes again with entrails of a beautiful woman the sequel to entrails of a virgin this time around the story is based around a psychologist megumi who decides to take on the yakuza to avenge the suicide of a doped up and raped patient that winds up on her doorstep one day when she gets over her head and the yakuza capture her she learns their insidious plat of doping up girls and selling them into slavery it apparently ends badly when she overdoses from the cocaine but she soon melds with another body to be disposed of to dum dum Â super slime this he she it makes mince meat out of the yakuza and saves the really br br well it is better than entrails of a virgin but not by much most of the film a whopping 67 minutes consists of rape and sex with fogging and the usual ho hum stuff almost towards the end we finally get our gore groove on with a few cool sequence like an alien inspired penis monster through the stomach scene and a gooey but it still suffers from a hyper low budget feel that makes it fun but can't elevate it from z grade soft horror core fare
<START> i tend to fall in and out of love with anime as the more you watch the more you notice a lot of shows are just poor copies of the few gems or rehashes of old formulas but every once in a while one of the true gems comes along and it's originality just blows you away is truly one of those shows many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation into an animated show is rather poorly done and doesn't utilize the benefits animation has over static drawings is actually based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders beautiful animation great voice acting great music and a complete and well paced story watch it you won't be disappointed and i'd suggest watching it in broadcast order it works so much better that way
<START> i hope we never become to cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this movie beautiful to look at with its romantic english countryside and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty watch this with your children especially your young daughters velvet brown is a wonderful role model for girls this was one of my daughter's favorite films br br the story is based on a best selling book by enid about a girl velvet whose whole life is her horse pi and about her single minded pursuit of her impossible dream i won't say anymore about the plot less i spoil it for first time viewers she lives with a big loving family in a small coastal village br br this is the movie that made elizabeth taylor a star and to watch the film is to understand why she is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that matches her outward beauty trusting passionate innocent she is the emotional core of the movie br br mickey rooney gives a wonderful performance as mi the young man who arrives on their doorstep one day stays and helps velvet train the pi this is one of his finest performances also standing out is anne revere as mother in an academy award winning role her strong loving and wise character understands that life isn't of much value unless you follow your dreams we're alike i too believe that everyone should have a chance at a breathtaking piece of folly once in his life br br i heartily recommend this very sweet very inspiring classic from hollywood's golden age
<START> i really liked the first part of this film in africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by civilized humans in scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad i couldn't watch some of it however this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didn't understand by studying it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied which we know now shouldn't be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit and as as possible i do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the 19th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple beautifully primitive life tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimps after the violent death of his parents in the african jungle br br christopher lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of tarzan role as was ralph richardson in his last film role as tarzan's ultra rich nobility reeking gramps in scotland andy macdowell was pretty and pretty good as tarzan's gussied up and civilized jane in her first movie role from his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes i cannot understand why lambert did not later become a big star but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in the terrific ian holm as a wounded frenchman in africa helped by tarzan and who then escorted tarzan back to his previously unknown ancestral home in scotland was great as always br br i am so glad tarzan got sick of and didn't stay in the animal cruel civilized world at that time and went home to africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape relatives who raised him instead of staying in scotland and living like royalty which would have ruined him if it didn't kill him first
<START> a man by the name of joseph is found brutally murdered in his apartment it would appear that was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the previous evening and with one of them seemingly missing the evidence certainly implicates the missing soldier but as detective finlay digs deeper into the case he finds that they could be barking up the wrong tree and that this crime is dealing with something desperately sad and vile anti semitism br br crossfire was born out of the novel written by richard brooks adapted by john paxton and directed by the shrewdly excellent edward crossfire titled cradle of fear is a taut and gripping picture that boldly tackles anti semitism tho the makers were forced to tone down the story from the original source the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to anti semitism what remains largely due to rko supremo dore and producer adrian scott is a sort of creeping unease that drips with noirish style br br the cast features three bob's young mitchum and ryan with noir darling gloria grahame adding the emotional female heart tho only third billed it's robert ryan's picture all the way his portrayal as the bullying conniving montgomery is from the top draw and perfectly showcases the talent that he had in abundance ryan had good cause to give montgomery some of is best work for he had served in the marine's with richard brooks himself both men having discussed the possibility that if the novel was to be made into a film then ryan wanted in and to play montgomery thus the genesis of ryan's career as weasel types was born gloria grahame also puts in a wonderful and heartfelt turn which is all the more remarkable since she was being plagued by her abusive husband at the time stanley was known to be violent towards her and his constant presence around the set irked others in the cast but grahame probably channelling real life emotion became the character of ginny and shone very bright indeed both bob mitchum and bob young come out with flying colours as well to really seal the deal on what a smartly acted picture crossfire really is br br tho crossfire was released before the other 1947 anti semitic picture gentleman's agreement and raking in over a million and a quarter dollars at the box office some of its thunder was stolen by the academy award winning picture from fox studio nominated for best picture best supporting actor ryan best supporting actress grahame best director and best screenplay it won nothing but critics of the time hailed it as a brilliant shift in american cinema and today it stands tall proud and dark as a bold and excellent piece of work 8 5 10
<START> i saw the movie at the nashville film festival on may 1 2003 it was amazing all the things that i had read about were portrayed incredibly well by tony writer director producer editor michael imperioli incredible job as and all the others involved in this i'm glad he didn't go down the leaving las vegas routine with bad habits but instead put us inside his life family and his gift tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his screenwriting skill a big thumbs up on this one
<START> let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies psycho 1960 has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction poor acting and poor cast the best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step acting by acting and process by process to the original br br alfred hitchcock one of the greatest movie directors ever lived had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time okay people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didn't prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 oscars gus van sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998 what should have looked realistic in color did not after the shower scene norman washes his hands it is easily that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax once he washes off the blood his hand is red in color br br about acting perhaps there couldn't have been a better cast of janet leigh and anthony perkins in the original perkins suited well for norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine in this version i personally think vince vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play norman's role unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible in the motel office where norman and marion have the long conversation he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout in the original in the same scene when the madhouse is described we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on perkins's face and he looks angry although not aggressively vince vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he's just had his lines by heart again terrible acting same is with anne heche in the opening scene in the original we can see how tensed and nervous marion janet is when she drives to phoenix she was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life that's what i call acting in the remake heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically for getting the money i don't think anyone would be happy and smiling when they've just stolen and the entire state police is behind them in the shower scene janet in the original grips the curtain turns around and dies after getting stabbed in the remake heche gets stabbed turns around then sways the other way has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort again terrible acting br br there are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation in the scene where gets murdered two scenes blink in between the stabs one with a naked woman and the other with a sheep many people including myself aren't exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was what on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an investigator's murder the changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary there are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well br br let me add some and the only positive points along with that i felt julianne moore did her job well and played a good character of lila and william macy acted well that was almost exactly how character should have been played br br it is common man's knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line and to try and make it look better than the original and if anything has happened here according to what i just said it is directly the opposite unfortunately many people like me weren't impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version br br please do not watch this movie it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not the best
<START> i saw this film on the same night i saw 6 other shorts this one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting directing filming and originality of story it comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films br br this is a great short film for the following reasons br br 1 amazing performances the 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly their chemistry is palpable the depth of their relationship is conveyed even though the film is 10 mins long the acting and directing are very powerful br br 2 beautifully shot the lighting framing and general filming are striking the 35mm film sets this movie apart from other shorts and what a difference it makes the filming is worthy of this film stock br br 3 strong story often short films try to do too little or too much with the time or they are trying to tell a predictable story this is a good balance of telling you an interesting story without drawing it out too long or leaving you unsatisfied you wonder what will happen next while at the same time feeling you saw something happen br br nice score too compliments without overpowering br br if you can find this at a festival make an effort to see it
<START> side show is one of the weirdest horror movies ever made from full moon pictures very gory in some places but not as shocking as the trailer makes it out to be the trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts also the acting and visual effects are well done i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere br br 8 out of 10 br br fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master skinned alive slumber party massacre sleep away camp and other full moon pictures flicks for other recommendations check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section
<START> i just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks br br what this was probably the worst asian horror movie i've seen br br spoilers there were just so many fundamental problems with the story a lot of asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary with notable exceptions ringu and ju on this is the case here except they aren't scary a pretty asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all the monk character straight up explains everything as being a perfectly natural cycle of life nothing scary there either but the woman just doesn't get it she would rather kill herself and her baby then let this poor ghost be reincarnated my friend and i were just laughing when she jumped off the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why she's been following her around that information would have been nice to know before she started jumping but whatever br br that said i did like a couple of parts right in the middle first she rides a taxi with a ghost ghosts ride taxis that has a whole lot of extra hair which inexplicably is creepy right after that at the bus stop well you need to see it as it's pretty messed up br br all in all this movie is a total bomb i gave it an extra point just for those two scenes above this is a poor quality asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying into women's almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images
<START> this is by far the worst and most stupid show i have ever seen on tv it is almost physically painful to watch an adult well in his twenties doing nothing but torture and mock his parents who always seem to have no clue what so ever about the stunts they are forced to endure by their dimwitted son and his equally stupid friends of course i know his parents are in on it but i really hate how they always act like they are caught completely by surprise it seems fake through and through and i really hate the intro of the show in which a voice over asks bam what will he think of next i think that's how it is anyway and bam himself answers whatever the f k i want wow bam is really a hell raiser living at home with mum and dad of course the word f k is replaced with a tasteful beep but we get the message bam is the real deal rebel at least in his own eyes of course bam and his posse of numb aim at an audience of teenage boys and of course it's a mtv show but please raise the bar a little it's painfully predictable and stupid and therefore nothing but boring
<START> worst movie ever i can't believe they had to hire jeremy irons to give this piece of crap some credibility and still failed did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own probably hey let's make lots of things explode and give mina big boobs and have her speak in an adorably fake broken english that'll make the morons watch but sir that's not how the book went at all i think we're mot being faithful to mr wells' message f ck it we're going to the box office here never mind some dead author's ideas on human nature also let's add in orlando jones with some classic 'black as a supporting character and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book guy pierce has to get some p at the end
<START> the great dictator is a beyond excellent film charlie chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism the anti nazi speech by chaplin at the end with its values is one of filmdom's great moments throughout this movie i sensed there was some higher form of intelligence beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking at work
<START> after clocking up five seasons on the small screen from 1976 79 'george mildred' transferred themselves to the big screen in mid 1980 instead of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke retaining their roles as writers dick sharples was brought on board as the writer sadly this film adaption just did not seem to hit the spot with the public shame i liked it better than the series itself in fact it was a guilty pleasure br br yootha joyce is keen to ascertain whether or not her slovenly husband 'george' brian murphy has remembered their wedding anniversary obviously he hasn't but to try and convince his wife otherwise he books a table at the restaurant where he proposed marriage to mildred several years ago br br upon arriving at the restaurant they find out that the place has changed hands eventually seeing through george's lies mildred insists that they celebrate their anniversary at a swanky hotel upon arriving at the hotel george is mistaken by crook johns for a ruthless hit man who wants a rival to be exterminated br br not an outstanding comedy as such but a good natured piece of fun all the same plans to revive the series after the film's showing were sadly terminated when yootha joyce died on 24th august 1980 of alcohol poisoning br br funniest moment george talking to his favourite garden gnome his neighbour tristram creeps up behind him and says think its time we had a george thinking it has developed the power of speech drops the gnome in shock br br merry christmas to fellow imdb users in particular and have a good one
