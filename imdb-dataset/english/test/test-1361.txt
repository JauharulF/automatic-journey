<START> nigel maze like novel 'a way through the wood' has been adapted by julian fellowes who also directs this drawing room suspense piece it is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the benign malignant characters and it is here that fellowes' directorial choices are superb the story has a linear line that is easy to follow but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player as a single incident ignites a minefield of disasters br br james manning tom wilkinson is a successful business obsessed solicitor in london married to anne emily watson who needs more in her life the couple being childless live in the country in a beautiful estate assisted by their long term maggie linda bassett they attend social outings and meet among others william rupert everett the passively lazy wealthy neighbor anne decides they should entertain their neighbors and against gruff james' anne proceeds with planning james arranges to 'not attend due to business' on the night of the party there is a hit and run accident in which maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a range rover she observed when james returns home he sees a scratch on william's range rover and suspects william to be the perpetrator anne discourages james from going to the police with the information 'what possible good can it do but ruin bill's life as a socialite and father and son of an important scion ' from this first the virus spreads james confronts bill who talks james out of going to the police anne confesses it was she who was driving bill's rover and is the one responsible james convinces anne to keep it quiet because it would ruin his reputation anne confesses she is having an affair with bill and the three of them concur that they will stick together on their big lie for the sake of the greater good anne eventually succumbs to the guilt of not telling her beloved maggie that she is the one responsible and maggie herself guilty of a previous theft whose life was saved by anne's mercy to hire her anyway is the agent who draws the story to its surprising conclusion lies begat lies that begat lies et cetera br br the major impact of this intrigue is the manner in which the isolated tragedy impacts each of the characters involved each changes in a dramatic way tome wilkinson gives the finest performance of a career filled with brilliant performances he is able to say more with his posture and facial expressions than about any actor before the audience today likewise the gifted emily watson adds yet another fine role to her repertoire as does the surprisingly smarmy rupert everett who despite being yet another wealthy british gives us a man both arid of spirit and yet ultimately needy and the always fine linda bassett takes a small role and it making her character quietly central to the chaotic web of lies br br the cinematography by tony pierce roberts and the musical score by add immeasurably to the multiple atmospheres the story encounters this is ensemble playing at its finest which always means that the director julian fellowes has a fine grasp on the piece the interplay of these fine people makes the dodgy story work very well indeed grady harp
<START> dreadful a friend of mine who obviously thought i had an abysmal sense of humour recommended this br br it's bobbins i almost switched it off it is only my anal desire to not leave things unfinished that prevented me doing so br br this was evidently a british attempt to make a movie with a bunch of also ran tv actors using some lame script from their mate in the business i struggle to think of anything even approaching the paucity of this movie less funny than global warming br br i'm not normally so vehement but i watched this well over ten years ago and thought that i wasted an hour or so of my life on it is destructive br br puerile plot less useless tosh br br i'd rather eat my feet than watch it again
<START> focus is another great movie starring william h macy i first discovered macy in fargo and i've seen a few of his films and he hasn't yet deceived me macy is the archetypal nice guy with something to hide in focus he plays the role of lawrence newman a loyal and hard working stiff who harbours his handicapped mother at home the scene is set after world war ii at the height of mccarthyism newman is the head of human resources for a company which is basically anti semite after he accidentally hires a woman of jewish descent he is asked to buy a pair of glasses to improve his failing eyesight br br unbelievably the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of gertrude hart his wife played by a great laura dern as the film unravels newman will begin to see a whole different world where being jewish is akin to being an animal br br the movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal the chilling thought is that in some places it probably still is
<START> yes this movie was just bad in every way in things like cast effects boredom excitement and of course being fantastic and we all know the four heroes in this one were a bit more colourful compared to the new ones but it still has to go a fantastic bore like this really was just silly trash which i knew nobody would like when i saw it i mean surely with that budget about 3 or 4 good movies could have been made but no i am just glad that the new version made this year totally showed everyone how the fantastic four should have been made with good story great cast like jessica alba one of my favourite actresses otherwise it would have been totally forgotten but thankfully no the new one was excellent when i saw it with my mates at the cinema but this old fantastic bore has gotta go
<START> it is so refreshing to see a movie like this with actual mood and personality instead of just a bunch of cgi cartoon gimmicks this is a great horror spoof that has genuine chills along side some really great sets and performances its laughs are subtle but plentiful because there is very little if any cgi there is no need to violently shake the camera around to hide the crappy effects this makes the movie immensely watchable compared to the other camera man must be sh ing his pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so br br far more enjoyable than the big budget re made garbage being released by hollywood today br br see it
<START> this is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist michael cain is called upon to an autobiography of a colorful waning hollywood star mickey rooney at times silliness becomes obnoxious this is not cain at his best rooney is way over the top notable support from lizabeth scott lionel and the comely nadia cassini not easy to watch
<START> this concert is the type of concert that only comes around every twenty years or so madonna's confessions on a dance floor era will certainly be remembered as one of the high points of her career she's 48 and she looks simply divine she keeps up with the dancers that are almost twenty years her junior i am also very glad to report that all the songs were sung live which is good because she actually sounds better live each song was so unique the visuals where stunning the performance of 'live to tell' was fantastic and had me awestruck was exotic and gorgeous and was rich with political symbolism the arabic horn the american eagle set free i particularly liked the performance of 'i love new york' i almost stood up in my lounge room and cheered when she told her critics to suck george bushes and then again i was impressed by the 70's inspired music inferno remix this spectacular concert made a fan out of me br br verdict highly recommended with a capital h
<START> a truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict the movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being or being around a heroin addict really is good movie which will never truly be outdated excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is preminger's way of showing how bleak a world can become worth a look an education of sorts the golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in
<START> the digital effects were done on the cheap and the action sequences lack suspense this was essentially made for tv and it shows david suchet looks bored and nigel looks down right embarrassed and as for robert dick van dyke london accent no comment if you want to pass away an hour or two when you've nothing on then it will do if your going to buy the dvd wait a few weeks and pick it up in the bargain bin at asda cos thats where its heading if the budget was bigger and richard doyle's book followed more closely then it could have been something special but as it stands its a bit poor watch the trailer instead or read the book and see what could have been
<START> i don't even know where to start i did not like it it did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the movie the pot the son was gay the murder was justified what possible reason could there be in the script for linda aka penelope to exist that was never explained it was all fluid spilled on a table and left dripping off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor br br why did vanessa redgrave make a five second cameo why did diane wiest use her bullets over broadway character without the camp fun why was jane birkin in the storyline to begin with the list is endless the movie ended and we all looked at each other like did you understand any of this br br i tell ya one thing if i watched my long lost dad get murdered i certainly wouldn't be hugging the murderer tell ya another thing if bob broke up with bob what purpose did hiding the son in the closet have was bob going to have sex with bob in front of the son how did the murderer contact the son so easily br br if this review sounds confused it is because this was a waste of film talent and time what the heck did the dead shrink have to do with anything br br this is one of the worst films i have ever seen because it should have could have been better stronger and it should have made some kind of sense any sense instead we are given a watered down diva the film from the 70s complete with a murder and tired performances reading boring words from a script that is completely insane br br by pass it folks or maybe me and the rest of the people who reviewed this film are too stupid to understand it all i mean after all it is a french film
<START> this is one of those movies which get better with each viewing i watched it three times and actually registered on imdb because i wanted to comment on it movies about food have been done before some of them are really good as for instance a certain japanese comedy which aficionados of asian cinema will know anyway but this one really is in its own league at its core is a protestant christian parable symbolizing the ideal of kindness but far from being dogmatic it also addresses the good in each and every of us regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof there is a pervading understatement and refinement in babette's feast but this makes the message of the movie if anything stronger not at all weaker if you cannot attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by babette you're still welcome to this feast of the soul highly recommended
<START> this is another notorious mexican horror film however while the original spanish language version is quite tame all sorts of gore and nudity were inserted for the english dubbed variant prepared by who did similar duties on the curious dr 1967 71 and like the u s version of that film had previously been available on dvd through something weird image br br i watched the original first and while no great shakes it was fairly engaging especially with a plot as familiar as this one was a doctor goes beyond the call of duty in attempting to save the life of his terminally ill son he even has a hulking game legged assistant played by carlos lopez who had essayed a strikingly similar role though in a more sinister vein in the curse of the crying woman 1961 i know that several mexican films mingled horror with the libre wrestling genre but i had never watched one myself this element is present here in fact the heroine is a wrestler but the two styles are perhaps thankfully kept apart that said the wrestling sequences are competently done with some of the moves proving highly amusing br br the doctor's son is transformed into a monster looking like the incredible hulk with mud splashed over his face after having had an heart transplanted into him but then when this is replaced with that of a comatose female wrestler he stays this way and grows a pair of fangs to boot shouldn't he realistically have turned into a transsexual though i guess that wouldn't have been very interesting the climactic rooftop sequence in which the monster kidnaps a child and meets his demise at the hands of the police is reminiscent of the ghost of frankenstein 1942 my favorite unintentionally funny moments in the film however occur when the doctor trying to comfort his son tells him that he'll soon be cured only to turn his back soon after on the verge of tears and also the impatient look he gives his crippled assistant as the latter staggers slowly into the car when they're about to chase the monster who has escaped from the lab br br the alternate nude scenes work for the film these were actually done by cardona himself for a mexican version entitled horror y sexo but its reputation is largely based on the added material showing over the top violence such as an eyeball being gouged out of its socket a and even a person's head being torn off there are also several graphic operation inserts which however give rise to a goof while it's made clear that only two people are involved in the operation we see a third pair of hands constantly holding an oxygen mask to the patient's face br br the film is also said to be a loose remake of own black and white horror film doctor of doom 1962 but since i haven't watched that one i can't say how much of it was actually pilfered for night of the bloody apes
<START> a talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all star high school football game when he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full scholarship if he plays well br br all too often these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen full matt certainly fits this profile but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager both over confident and vulnerable optimistic and cynical by turns influenced by amy matt grows into a man of character and heart he in turn forms friendships with his teammates which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player br br full ride has all the elements we love to see in a movie great acting admirable characters exciting sports scenes poignant drama and a love story still while one may have seen these elements in other films full ride is assisted by performances that are sincere and occasionally even moving perhaps what's most impressive about full ride is its sense of reality although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree clearly a disgruntled student who for quite obvious reasons received a poor grade in his film class director mark grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the grit of what life is like in a small town these characters are real people rooted in realistic situations which often create the most compelling entertainment on one level it is a love story on another it is a character study and yet another it is a simple football film all of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle
<START> i just got done watching the edge of love by the way this is one of the worst titles so far this year and it felt like a chore watching keira knightly's unlikable skeleton looking character made me cringe even more throughout the coarse of the film br br it took me four nights to watch this it was so boring the only good thing about it was cillian murphy he's always good believable and is severely under looked in many films this however was just not good enough for him br br apart from the unlikable characters boring storyline the plot was also emotionally unsatisfying i felt like i spent my time watching this for nothing which i did i should have done the smart thing and turned it off but i kept it on out of respect for cillian murphy and the great cinematography
<START> from 2002 on dutch cinema finally got better again this movie is still part and a example of the bad period of dutch cinema br br the story is needlessly told in flashback style all of the 'present' sequences set in france are completely redundant and add nothing to the story emotions or power for some reason european filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological i never understood why or what the appeal of it is br br the story self also isn't exactly the greatest it isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell the story of a young unexperienced boy falling in love with a wild young girl who later turns out to be quite psychotic might sound good enough on paper and even shows some parallels to paul verhoeven's turks fruit to which this movie often was compared to before and at the time of its release however the end result is far from comparable the story fails to capture the right emotions which is also due to the unimaginative performances from the actors the way the story is told also makes the movie far from always interesting or compelling i lost interest for this movie at about 40 minutes through the movie br br at the time this movie was made both and angela were promising rising stars with great potential and ambitions but both their careers have pretty much dried up by now angela seems to give her family more attention than her career that is not a bad thing of course while tried to start a career in hollywood he never got any further than playing some small bit parts in 2 renny harlin flops to be honest i'm not surprised it's not that he is a bad actor and he certainly has got the right looks but his english just isn't good enough to put it mildly just listen to him speaking english in the beginning of this movie and you'll understand what i mean they are really not bad actors but for some reason it doesn't show in this movie it's probably also due to the poor dialog i still kind of liked beau van he's been criticized a lot but his acting seems very natural he always keeps the characters close to who he self is br br it by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but it's not exactly one i would recommend either bad and uninteresting storytelling makes this a bad movie br br 4 10
