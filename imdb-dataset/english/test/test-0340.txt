<START> in the early 1990's step by step came as a tedious combination of the ultra cheesy full house and the long defunct loopy classic hit the brady bunch the differences between step by step and the two aforementioned shows was of course better writing excellent comedic timing from almost all of it's actors and a great deal funnier situations that weren't quite as sugar coated as it's extremely popular predecessors admittedly though even with the big boosts in the show's basic dynamics and all it still wasn't exactly spectacular nor was it really even that memorable in the long line of corny family programming it was just a much better time passer you might say in comparison to the cutesy migraine inducing full house which coincidentally ran neck and neck with step by step during that time period in terms of overall popularity the show now in syndication obviously is certainly suitable family fare but be sure to not expect much beyond that when watching it
<START> once upon a time troma the company that brought us cinema classics such as the toxic avenger rabid grannies redneck zombies and surf nazis must die decided long ago to adapt shakespeare's famous play 'romeo and juliet ' this adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding kinky sex extreme violence genital monsters body piercing and incest and it succeeded in creating a bizarre yet hilarious film anyone going into a troma production should know what to expect and that is irreverent and perverse comedy with plenty of political incorrectness expect plenty of nods to other troma films and plenty of re used gags flipping cars and head squashing many may think it sounds like utter crap that only morons would find funny they may be right but at the same time they may need to lighten up and enjoy the insanity and mind that is tromeo and juliet br br with a great cast a funny script by james gunn and lloyd kaufman a fitting soundtrack and plenty of great visual gags kaufman has yet again succeeded in turning what is right upside down and grossing the hell out of everyone get some popcorn grab a beer invite your friends over and enjoy tromeo and juliet for what it is a shakespeare adaptation with plenty of balls the end br br 4 5

<START> the trailer goes nowhere near and only scratches the surface of the film and rightly so too not because it has that obligation to keep its real narrative under wraps but because what actually transpires will provoke entirely different lines of questioning some of which are frustratingly not answered in the film leaving you to your own devices to interpret the series of events which of course means plenty of material for an after show discussion br br metaphorically the box refers to how us humans tend to subconsciously hole ourselves into situations or things in everyday life and how our enclosed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective seldom out of the box there's a speech made near the end by one of the characters that will leave you pondering over this fact which governs the basis of the entire film and even threading on existentialism where our bodies are mere vessels for the soul and from cradle to the grave we put ourselves in more boxes in a way of life fashion br br what i disliked about the film is how it tried to sound intelligent through the frequent name dropping of covert government agencies like the cia and nsa as though there's something overtly clandestine about these agencies that we should be aware of they serve little purpose other than to put every action and every person under scrutiny that nobody can be trusted wrecking havoc in a sense to both the characters and the audience as we try to keep up with trust issues to aid in the interpretation of the narrative having it set in 1976 against a nasa backdrop of manned space missions and in langley virginia also provided that heightened sense of wary that will sap your energies as you sit through it patiently br br based upon the short story button button written by richard matheson and made into an episode of the twilight zone the story follows the lewis family where husband arthur james marsden works at nasa and develops a prosthetic foot for his teacher wife norma cameron diaz and you'd think it's all happy family with their son walter sam oz stone until one day a mysterious man called arlington steward frank langella in a two face inspired facial effect whom we are preempted of in the opening comes knocking and giving them a deal or no deal button in a box plunge the button and they'll get a million bucks we're talking in dollar terms of the 70s here although a stranger out there will die if they don't well the got an date br br the story would dictate a deal be made which of course sparks off a mysterious sequence of events that unfold with even more shady characters who nosebleed appearing some whom are inexplicably zombie like apparently all under the influence or employment or arlington steward whether or not steward is death a clandestine government employee a messenger from god or a representative of aliens after an anal probe remains unanswered so whichever way you look at it it's as if he's delivering something expected just begging that mankind will shake off its innate greed so that his work can be cut short and to return to wherever he came from br br if you need a little distraction from the disparate scenes which make up the narrative the production sets and art direction are gorgeous in recreating the 70s look as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences that stem from a result of not fully understanding the fine print it's full circle this examination of human nature of our greed for immediate gratification manifesting its result in longer term pain confusion and further choices that we'll make based on real sacrifices nifty special effects come into play as well though it just leaves more room open as to the genre of the film br br so is it horror science fiction or a mystery thriller it's everything rolled into one actually together with a sprinkling of the philosophical just don't go expecting a straight narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end Â this is like an x files episode on steroids
<START> this film is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass globes that is used to kill this is apparently done to hide an espionage ring intent on stealing plans for a new american bomber now much of this plot was repeated in other chan films the jade mask and the docks of new orleans additionally it was first used in mr wong detective all had the exploding glass globes a plot element that obviously has been overused it was interesting in murder over new york but by these later films it was rather passÃ© br br fortunately the rest of the film was fresh and the plot worked out very well with a nifty conclusion where of course the culprit reveals himself however no plane could fly the way this one did especially in 1940 such extreme dives and rapid ascents were pretty silly out of this already obsolete plane br br by the way in a small role as a porter you'll see frank coghlan jr the same actor who played billy in the captain marvel serial according to imdb mr is 93 years old and retired from the film industry
<START> a boring movie about a miserable loser that's factotum in a nutshell matt dillon plays henry alter ego of author charles bukowski upon whose novel the film is based as we meet he may be a writer but he's certainly not a successful one he floats through life getting fired from one menial job after another and not caring a bit the fact that he's always drunk may have something to do with his not caring he meets a woman jan played by lili taylor and a relationship ensues moves into jan's apartment and now instead of getting drunk by himself he can get drunk with somebody else good times eventually he's had enough of this relationship so strikes out on his own unfortunately he still can't hold down a job so soon enough he's broke at this point marisa tomei shows up and for some reason her character laura decides to rescue this miserable drunken loser whom she doesn't even know we soon meet some of laura's acquaintances and the film veers off into a sort of bizarro world with this rather eclectic bunch soon enough tomei and friends are out of the picture and once again we're left with and his drinking and his miserable little life there's some more time spent with jan but mostly there's just time spent being a drunk loser and then the movie's over and not a moment too soon 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the movie drags on nothing happens nothing ever happens if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching matt dillon drink then this is the movie for you if you're looking for a compelling story well developed characters or any entertainment value whatsoever then you've come to the wrong place dillon's performance actually isn't bad at all too bad the movie which surrounds him is in fact rather bad
<START> i like this movie cause it has a good approach of buddhism for example the way buddhist use to care all kind of living things combining some fancy and real situations in some parts the photography is very good and a lot of messages about freedom as the hawk episode staying always focused in every moment even in tough situations it has also funny situations as swank's birthday and talking this two times academy awards her acting show us how the people who use to live in this kind of culture is trying to have a resistance behavior when miyagi is taking her to a buddhist temple and how she slowly is changing her mind and of course pat morita has been always great
<START> another end of the world film that begs comparison to the abysmal day after tomorrow following the same sort of structure as dat but with a distinctly japanese style how does it fare that depends on your taste for japanese melodrama br br i found that the small human touches to be what makes this film compelling for most of it's 2 hours also the frequent title cards explaining some of the science the effects are probably the best i've seen in a japanese film and they compare very well to anything out of hollywood many of the disaster scenes are truly horrifying even though the human carnage is usually off screen and that is one of the drawbacks while the terror of thousands of on screen deaths like in the recent war of the worlds might have too overwhelming we also don't really get a sense of the chaos of an entire nation crumbling into the ocean a few scenes touch on the chaos but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched on regardless this film works on a lot of levels and is way more realistic then dat that is until the end br br unfortunately the story hinges itself on one clichÃ©d plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the 1960's japanese earth in peril film after the reasonably good science and mostly realistic take on the disaster this makes for a bit of disappointment the sudden stopping of the film for a pop love song doesn't help either unless you like the song this made the exciting ending a bit of a drag for me br br the overall direction is good and the art design is excellent acting is all good as well recommended
<START> murder by numbers stars ryan gosling and michael pitt as two rebellious high schoolers who are content on the perfect murder for the sake of overcoming their shattered self esteem sandra bullock plays the heroic thorn in the way of their plans as det cassie mayweather this is nowhere near the traditional finger pointing murder mystery as the film graciously reveals the killers to us gosling and pitt what the film does instead is concentrate on the purposes of their killings and if they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder br br the title itself is a rightfully chosen one for various reasons mainly being that the numbers in the title is the most vocal the angle focusing on the reasons behind the heinous killings although will haunt you with its chilling dialogue especially from the callous boys it doesn't fully live up exploring the origins of what lead them to their killing frenzy the characters are riveting you have the good looking rich kid richard ryan gosling and the intelligent but socially awkward justin michael pitt in school they pretend that they despise one another and even share a liking towards the a classmate name lisa agnes bruckner but off school they are allies and collaborate in a ritual in which murder is an escape to free the mind br br sure the story involving the boys seems exciting but it's pushed in the background to a more mundane subplot involving det mayweather bullock who assumes their murders was because of discrimination hence the arrogant looks of gosling and unexplained characteristics but manages to get it right at first the audience may despise cassie's character due to the fact she's very headstrong and not very supportive she displays dominance and control over her junior partner sam kennedy ben chaplin even as he tries to reason with her he knows it's a battle he surely won't likely win br br the reason behind her tyrant behavior stems back in which cassie was the sad victim of a crime that has left a permanent mental scar on her this side story does not have much of a place in this movie partially because it doesn't offer anything riveting with the main plot the boys' murder spree it also offers some development to bullock's character in the movie but it's only a half assed job and not very fulfilling i would've liked it if they the diabolical students had a side story the resources were right there in front of them for the perfect crime foil the creative schemes for the boys to manipulate the cops with their phony evidence and lies just to get out of a potential life sentence in jail br br despite the sub plots and the pointless real killer ending murder by numbers sports a strong performance by a great cast sandra bullock was convincing as the tough verbally remorseless cop who tries to shift her inner pain to a more positive light ben chaplin shows his strength as the young detective who tries every way to understand his partner and is able to fend off her occasional tyrannical put downs but the scene are the devilish duo of michael pitt and ryan gosling as they keep you glued to their seat waiting for what they're going to do next the chemistry of the boys is reminiscent to matt damon jude law in the talented mr ripley
<START> if we could have separate tables why not separate lies br br this becomes somewhat involved a housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle the culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for the latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred to complicate matters further the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing therefore people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident sounds like she wants revenge br br this all becomes convoluted when our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car she recants her testimony much to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case br br as if this isn't enough several months later our lover rupert everett becomes terminally ill and our lady emily watson leaves her husband tom wilkinson to care for him br br the acting is quite good here despite the never ending peyton place like theme tom wilkinson is a solicitor who tries to protect his wife br br the film is a good one but we could have done without the terminal illness o well the marriage ended anyway
<START> wow i just witnessed one of the greatest poker tragedies and i'm not talking about the premature death of the great stu ungar this film i'm sorry to say was terrible absolutely terrible a true tragedy in filmaking history well maybe i'm being a little harsh but unless you have some interest in the life of stu ungar then don't even consider coming near this one and those that do have an interest in his life will find that most parts were and made out to be great novelty scenes i watched it because of stu ungar but nearly wanted to end myself like he did while watching this movie 4 stars for effort but unpleasantly painful
<START> an amazing film i've only just seen it and i already want to see it again i'd never heard of derek jarman before i saw this film but now i am i can't wait to see his others the film takes a whole new perspective of shakespeare's the tempest i'm sure he'd have appreciated it for use of the the play's themes of love magic darkness and atmospheric tension ok ok there may have been a bit of nudity in the film which i hadn't really anticipated but it didn't offend me it just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable one spoiler for those of a nervous disposition fast forward the flashback scene with and ariel as their slave its pretty graphic overall if you are starting to find kenneth branagh's shakespeare performances flaccid and monotonous then you need to see this film fantastic and surreal it'll blow you away but only if you let it have an open mind and then let this film work it's magic on you
<START> i'm shocked that all the hated it ratings are sixes and sevens still above average to me this seems a case of the emperor has no clothes i understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's regardless it became a struggle to sit through and watch the dvd i saw did have some subtitles but about 75 of the speech is not subtitled some of it is hard to understand the jamaican patois was cool to hear but you struggle not to out' after awhile some of the shots were nice and the realism was there even if some of the performances were not great jimmy cliff did a good job the plot is not bad but quite predictable in the 1 43 film the highlights are jimmy cliff ivan singing for a scene and a couple of shoot outs and a fight probably 15 minutes or so the rest is pretty boring btw near the beginning of the film there are some weird cuts with the ivan character that seem like a editing mistake which made me laugh for a bit one reviewer said this film has been cut so many times that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there the ending was kind of interesting showing how the media from a young age influences people it could also be a general comment on the white man's influence on other main themes are poverty corruption church ambition in closing the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile the film much less
<START> i suppose i'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt these laboratory movies and yes they spend a lot of time in the laboratory always fail in one dimension there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time of course they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that dr frankenstein's did there is always something they didn't anticipate there are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here the young woman is certainly fetching and the doctor can't help himself but he could have been a little bit discreet or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing things go wrong and because of this intellect she gains tremendous power including an understanding of how she came to be rock hudson looks pretty fit here he never quite makes it in this role however it wanders all over with lots of clichÃ©s and silliness which diminishes the basic issue once she has her revenge a more suitable thing would be for her to wander off and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand way
<START> explores the frontiers of extreme boredom life in a small canadian town in winter as an experiment in extreme sensory deprivation absolutely nothing happens as viewed through the eyes of a blank deadpan totally uninteresting protagonist viewers of this film should be prepared to in the style of altered states br br in a groundbreaking study david found that he could predict alzheimer's thirty years in advance by comparing the autobiographical essays of nuns as they entered the convent those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct prose the essays were quiet and contemplative with little optimism or episodes of joy br br now why did i mention that perhaps my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable autobiographical contemplative film which shows in simple direct style the bleak and stoic life of a small community living next to giant slag heaps of asbestos br br this film became popular at the height of the quebec movement because of its presentation of this community as permanently wounded victims tragically its writer director was soon diagnosed with alzheimer's disease in the early 1980s and apparently committed suicide
