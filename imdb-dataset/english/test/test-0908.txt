<START> note i only saw approximately the last half of this movie so feel free to take my review with whatever grain of salt you deem appropriate that being said seeing what i saw was more than enough to make me quite convinced that a one star rating for this is enough br br in short it's a dismal plot slaughter of the wonderful precursor nl christmas vacation with chevy chase only it doesn't have chevy chase in it and it takes place in a generic tropical island essentially with no connection to christmas at all br br ol' chevy probably didn't want in because the plot is that devoid of actual fun instead they got the screwy cousin eddie who again was great in the original but in this he is just over the top and an extremely poor basis for any movie considering the plot and acting the attempts at humor are generic to a degree where even contemporary television comedy trumps it and considering that this is supposed to be comedy i doubt i need to say more br br this is not to be seen for its qualities for it has none but for it's failings and again how hollywood is spilling it's life's blood of the past in the pursuit of a quick buck br br i think i'll watch the original before the upcoming christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence from a lost time when motion pictures were more than just high budget but mindless garbage
<START> i wasn t expecting much with harlem nights but i wasn t expecting it to be as bad as it was without doubt the worst aspect is the obscene language it really is awful the amount there is in this film and before anyone accuses me of being a wimp let me point out two things br br 1 amongst my fave films i would include platoon raging bull while my favourite movie of all time is apocalypse now br br 2 my all time favourite american television show is the hbo prison drama oz br br so you see films and television shows with massive amounts of swearing don t normally bother me but the problem i had with harlem nights is to do with the fact it s supposed to be a comedy but it seems the production team came to the conclusion that an audience laugh everytime someone especially if that someone is black says a rude word and decided to funny situations with swearing all the way through the film hoping to get a laugh well i thought i d never start laughing and i didn t
<START> still funny after all these years midnight madness is good entertainment for all ages it introduces michael j fox as a typical 15 year old trouble maker and are by far the funniest characters in it and leon is perfectly cast as a wierdo game master the budding romance between adam and the girl couldn't have been any cheesier
<START> if any movie ever made italians look bad this is it br br duke mitchell what an a hole duke mitchell i s t on your grave seeing as practically every person gunned down in this film by the cowardly mimi is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority it's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the ku klux klan or skinheads awww but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence so that means he can't be all bad right wrong typical sentimental tripe br br while i do understand why some people might be struck by and even to a certain extent admire the film's audacious totally un pc verve it's certainly unashamed of its own hatefulness and sense of self involvement but this doesn't change the fact that the main character mimi and by extension duke mitchell is thoroughly loathsome human being who earns not one iota of empathy or interest especially given that duke mitchell is such a complete bore as a performer but what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame apart from this dog t d of a movie was being a second rate dean martin imitator
<START> this movie narrate the story of john belushi based of his biography wrote by bob woodward all of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order where after the death of john belushi we see one angel accompany belushi during few points of his life michael in the character of john belushi is enough credible but entirely devoid of the devastate force of belushi and his play stay only a pale animation the director on more not succeed to give on the story that for who not knows the book is very confused but the worse is that they have featured bob woodward that spoke with belushi before he died for this negative points the movie is only a would be attempt to narrate the controversial story of john belushi my rate is 4
<START> once again bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which uncut is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today the fact that the evil that men do is very disturbing in its verbal and visual depictions of torture is not the problem it is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented interestingly this film seems to symbolize that latter part of bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same predictable and uncreative plots one hopes this fine actor will rise again
<START> i just went to see this movie with a friend i quickly looked and read a short synopsis and thought it sounded interesting we came out the movies not feeling very sure if we liked it not br br the acting was good enough and connection with characters was ok the main character i thought acted a lot like someone like van helsing yes it was pretty entertaining br br but the plot i felt like it was used from other movies the script was a bit weak i'm not sure why every time something bad happens the main character says oh my god every time br br the special effects worked well but sorry for this spoiler the main monster at the main climax reminded me a lot of the out of lord of the rings br br overall the movie was ok but i felt like it's been done already go and see buy all means but don't expect too much
<START> mel brooks really outdid himself with this hilarious stand up of the robin hood story the cast is perfect and cary elwes does a fine job at his role in my personal opinion besides the fact that i'm a cary elwes fan this movie is the best and funniest i've ever seen it will have you laughing every time you see it
<START> this is what porn used to be this is a true classic i mean it is an x rated musical based on an actual book there is a real plot to it and how many x rated movies can boast that these days this belongs in an exclusive short list of true pornographic movie classics including does dallas deep throat and behind the green door i think the problem with pornographic movies these days is that it's all about the pornographic and not about the movie alice in wonderland has graphic depictions of sex sure but it is actually telling a story at the same time not one of the typical oh mr police man don't write me a ticket plots this takes it another step further and makes it a musical fabulous if you want to see an example of good porn this is one of the best
<START> this allegedly based on a true story tv movie concerns a woman on the run from the fbi and a seriously stupid guy br br first we have roger paulson tim matheson a regular guy type with a mind numbing job an ex wife a kid he hardly ever gets to see and some cats br br next there is elaine lisa you name it tracy pollan a smart sexy good looking woman whose tongue would burst into flame if she ever told the truth br br roger and lisa meet when she answers a lonely hearts ad roger is one of these poor saps who can't seem to handle living alone so after his wife dumped him he places his ad br br it doesn't take long for roger to figure out that lisa is not a good person but he has no idea how to get rid of her he doesn't even have enough sense to change the locks on his apartment door after he throws her out br br go ahead and watch this if you don't have anything else to do br br
<START> talk radio is my favorite oliver stone movie though he has made many great ones including salvador jfk natural born killers and platoon but i like the intimacy of talk radio a cinematic expansion of eric searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a dallas talk show host working with ace cinematographer robert richardson stone turns what could have been a very set bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war bogosian is devastating as tortured on air of abuse barry and conveys the conflicted destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self loathing alec baldwin as his alpha male boss strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose he helped nurture ellen greene is fantastic as barry's sweet ex wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol stone and bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity john c mcginley as barry's long suffering screener technical producer stu turns in a hilarious sharp performance as does the great michael wincott the film is a flawless underrated masterpiece of superb writing awesome acting and brutal uncompromising direction the stewart copeland score is brilliant too
<START> the gig is a tight funny and poignant little movie about a group of friends that have gathered together on a regular basis to play for fun the group unexpectedly lands a real paying job in musician's parlance a gig br br they travel to upstate ny for a two week gig at a summer resort minus one member who bows out due to contracting cancer at the last minute they hire a professional to take his place things get sticky as an over the hill frankie valli type attempts a comeback at the resort and tries to utilize the group as his band br br the attitude the professional bass player gave the guys rang true by signing up to play the two week gig they were taking bread out of the mouths of someone who needed the job to feed his or her family while pop rock rap country and western and r b stars make money off of albums jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living almost nobody gets rich the guys living their dream also cost others a needed income br br i believe that almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with some proficiency dreams about playing a paying gig one time or another woody allen and kevin bacon are two popular examples of this amateur to professional crossover i especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played music professionally my mom who was a musician loved it
<START> holy crap the beginning picked up where the first one left off good start then it goes downhill from there you it looked like as if you were watching tv and you keep on switching between this teenage soap opera a predator movie and some crappy detective show the characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes don't have anything to do with each other until the final 45 minutes or so the characters of the teenage soap opera and the actual alien story br br then for the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a nuke on the city br br p s what the crap is the deal with the cameras being so zoomed in you can't tell what's going on seriously movie makers do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight
<START> nothing is sacred just ask ernie these days everybody has a video camera and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying quickly written and shot and often posted directly to the internet spoofs are hot these days and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don't get off on their own self importance 25 years ago when the first star wars was made it was a different world filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare then god gave us hardware wars it was shot to look cheap or was it just cheap and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact does that take away from the experience heck no that's what makes it so great it was raw and unpolished and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie from fluke waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber i did that when i was young to the wookie monster to auggie ben nah just a little headache remark this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual star wars films rent it buy it borrow it from a friend and may the farce be with you always
<START> is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from peter dalle but from the swedish cinema industry itself it is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before christmas in december 1945 which it does very well almost the whole plot takes place on a train non stop to berlin on the train is a mix of homosexuals nuns deported refugees murderers alcoholics and the failure literature critic played by the in sweden famous actor gustav the leading role is the type of person that although his intentions are for the best seems to drag everyone near him in a extremely funny way into disaster and to a living hell especially for a from the finnish war homecoming wounded soldier played by the extremely funny comedian robert on the train is also a doctor who cheats on his wife with his mistress they have together planned to murder the doctors wife that is also travelling with the same train without any knowledge about her husbands intentions will the wife of the doctor elude the plans to murder her and will everyone else survive the unlucky fellow
