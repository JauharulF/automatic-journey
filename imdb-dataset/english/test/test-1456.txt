<START> death wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be terrible acting implausible ridiculous death scenes creepy evil for no reason villains the last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film especially in the scene where the decent hardworking citizens string chains across the street knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them only to be joined by the neighborhood children in celebration and how can i forget the elderly woman with the broom she's sweeping out the scum and if that's not enough let's not forget how quickly the punks give up after is killed i'm laughing just thinking about it br br i also love the death scene of girlfriend he just walks away after seeing her get blown up it's little things like this that make death wish 3 such a bad movie and i'm not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrack br br i watched this movie because of martin balsam who i seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever and who's own getting beaten up by the scum scene is hilarious and i walked away with a new favorite movie thank you death wish 3 for making me laugh so hard br br some other things i forgot to mention 1 the weird sound effect after says cash when buying his used car ha it's so evil sounding 2 mandy mandy did the writers run out of tough guy names 3 the fact that the gangs apparently have a lend and lease thug exchange program i need some more guys and that mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building 4 at the end of the movie after blows up is it just me or does it look like the street gang is about to break into choreography as they're giving up just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the stop signal br br i love this movie nothing cheers me up like death wish 3
<START> at least if you're a disney fanatic well of the variety who loves their live action films as well as the animated stuff if you're a kid if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you're an adult if you love absolutely any film that features animals especially when they're doing tricks or if you're just not too demanding air bud world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch i'm a disney fanatic i enjoyed this film enough and i'll gladly watch it again br br but boy does it have a lot of problems the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all in the space of 82 minutes we've got adults getting married teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it teen competition for love and jealousy preteens playing spy games dogs falling in love dogs playing soccer dogs having puppies manipulative parents who'll do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids housekeeper dilemmas and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots i'm probably forgetting something but that's 10 big plot issues to be dealt with with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them and presumably weave them into a coherent whole that's both not too complicated this is a kids' film after all and that's also humorous and heartwarming not surprisingly director bill on his first turn being completely in charge he has a lot of previous second unit experience wasn't quite up to the task i'm sure it didn't help that there were at least three screenwriters involved and probably dictating producers as well br br the end result is that air bud world pup is extremely choppy events occur with little justification and worse often little explanation people figure out and do things primarily because they need to and fast so that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes from one cut to the next time might jump ahead six months or so we have both adults who seem like maybe they're mentally disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action some of the threads should have simply been removed because it's difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as you're introduced to an idea it's already passed you by br br also not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a rip off of one hundred and one dalmatians 1961 minus a cruella de vil character and another problem is that given the way the film is edited i have to assume that the dog air bud probably couldn't do much with the soccer ball unlike the first two films a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here and when we see him it's in very quick glimpses every once in a while these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animation br br yet for someone like me there's a cheesy charm to air bud world pup the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous hokey and kinda clichÃ©d i tend to like that combination it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre and at times like the ending when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the u s women's soccer team air bud world pup is so blatantly tacky that you can't help but love it
<START> i am partly a fan of miyazaki's work i say partly because most of his films fall into two categories brilliant and boring sadly this film falls into the later category br br this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazaki's recent film howl's moving castle an intriguing premise is set up but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it br br the first third of the film reveals the post apocalyptic world the story is set in and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold from then on things go down hill the middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly veiled eco propaganda and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of japanese animated films br br overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators what is left is something which is visually stunning although sadly the version i saw was an nth generation copy with poor colour which gives rise to the common myth that nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused
<START> a look at three geishas who are way past their prime now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present kin played by floating has sworn off men and has made a good living as a everyone on the block owes her the other two nobu and wish they could land husbands but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will meanwhile their children one has a son and one a daughter are both about to get married not to each other is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature but they are also understandably self serving after her son leaves she'll be alone a bit into the film two of former clients come looking for her one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him the other one of her handsomest clients unfortunately he comes for her money not her love the way i've described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing but it's really not sad but not fatally so it's more bittersweet unfortunately i only marginally liked late the story seems better when i look back on it but it is very slow and dull i actually nodded off twice during the film and i wasn't at all tired before i started it this is the kind of film that i can appreciate more than like it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of ozu's more famous films 7 10
<START> sure this film was retarded but you expected that the moment you looked at the cover box it's a b movie and on the t a factor this movie delivered truthfully it was funnier than expected while it was by no means a work of comedic genius like the party animal or orgazmo as far as b movies go it was worth the watch if you're into that sort of thing anyway br br christians and morally oriented parental groups this is soft core adult entertainment if you don't want your children watching sexual content and nudity then you should keep your children away from this film
<START> despite the apparent structural similarity with the simpsons loud fat dad mum 3 children a pet typical suburban home family guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to the simpsons its avid use and sometimes too much of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season while some hit the nail on the head the rhea perlman and danny devito bit in season 5 is spine hilarious others are less successful coming across as contrived and they can be annoying especially when they don't advance the story line the jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting br br the chemistry between and brian griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold so much so that chris and meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family br br however the feature film griffin the untold story is horrible thank goodness it went straight to dvd br br contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial simpsons seth approach with family guy is actually very different it's much more politically incorrect and amazingly a lot more brazen br br creator of ren and stimpy john famously criticized family guy for having extremely low graphic standards from a standpoint i don't think it looks that bad though the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful br br all in all a great series to go with a great big bowl of chips smothered in ranch sauce and ass jokes
<START> i am truly sad that this is the first bad review i've ever made for a movie ever i could stand to watch this movie and it is the second movie in all the movies i've seen that is just a downgrade the first is open water that just had no point whatsoever the next karate kid didn't have any mention of daniel correct me if i'm wrong please and that ending line came as a shock it was like if must fight win then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing and i was like oh okay so it'll take a while for this next part and then the credits hit the screen br br geez man hopefully i will never have to review a movie in a bad manner again i apologize for those of you who like the next karate kid i really really do
<START> i saw this title again on i also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same with me i am 35 and he is 17 he liked it and i did too it still is funny a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment satish shah is hilarious in multiple roles this sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on tv but obviously some people obviously like mundane fares that come out today it would have been nice that shafi inamdar would have continued for all the seasons he is no longer alive today i would wish if someone could list all the episodes here br br who can forget the lines yeh kya ho raha hai what a relief boss hai 30 years ka experience hai br br and the title track yeh jo hai teaching us to live the life as it comes and take enjoyment out of it the life of common people br br i still like this sitcom it may not seem as funny at times but certain episodes are still hilarious
<START> while the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film i could have stopped there and gone on with my life she does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects but not really enough to add to the validity of the film br br i also felt she went a bit overboard with many things if a guy said a filthy comment grabbed her or made some disgusting gesture to her i would say go for it bring him down he's a pig what bothered me though is she would walk around in revealing clothes and be surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it br br i think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are guys will look at beautiful women especially when they dress provocatively just like women will look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all br br some women may hate me for this but i hope not i have much respect for women i was raised by one i also come from a spanish family and we are very matriarchal my grandmother was the center of my family for years but i don't really feel this did anything to help women's rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself some women were offended by her project
<START> i saw this movie on the festival 23 24 25th of august after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of skating i didn't now what to expect from this movie was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks or was it a documentary about skating br br so i went in after waiting for about an hour whit out any expectations br br this movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of skateboarding it started with the team who where a fine group of surfers this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on so they try something else skateboarding was a fact br br if you were a part of the team in that time you where one of the cool guys girls because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the team so they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard br br in no time skateboarding was popular again there were a couple of competitions and one national competition the team was taking part on several competition and also the national one but what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable but the jury didn't now how to judge them so they put the whole skateboarding world on it's head br br anyway i can tell you the rest of the film documentary but you must see this one with you're own eyes because then you can feel the vibe of this movie this movie got a lot of style for me so i rewarded it with a 8 br br greetings from and the rest of holland see you
<START> the premise of the film was very promising sort of a gay napoleon dynamite type of film and to be fair there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasn't very good overall the script and dialog felt like a local sketch production full of clichÃ©s and scenes that were predictable br br however there was enough that was amusing that i stuck around to see how it finished since there were hints that something special happens at the end but it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt almost skipping directly from what looked to be the key conflict in the film to the final credits br br overall it was very disappointing but not completely unwatchable
<START> thunder alley finds fabian banned from nascar tracks after causing the death of another driver stanley adams might want to put him on his team of racers but the other drivers aren't for having him around br br desperate for employment fabian hooks up with an auto stunt show owner jan murray who's paying him peanuts and trying to capitalize on fabian's bad rep he's got to take it but annette funicello who's murray's daughter provides another reason to stick around br br the rest of the film is fabian's struggle to get back to the nascar circuit while at the same time juggling both annette and his current girl friend diane mcbain personally i would have taken mcbain she has it all over annette br br thunder alley is helped by location shooting at the southern nascar tracks and good film footage of nascar racing not helped by a rather silly story which delves into the real reason for fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from same br br still fans of nascar might go for this
<START> it was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies and there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off but the biggest problem i had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies the director and writers of the comebacks somehow forget to get creative while i must admit that i laughed at certain scenes the comebacks could have been so much funnier the actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie a spoof demands this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this because of the failure of the cast to do so the jokes never hit their mark some scenes take forever and normally in spoofs that doesn't have to be a problem take naked gun for instance their is always something happening on screen in the comebacks they didn't even bother to let stuff happening in the background only a couple of factors make this movie worth watching it still is fun to spot the movies that are made fun off and jermaine williams as ipod his parody on cuba gooding jr as radio was hilarious he seemed to be the only one in the cast to get the idea of what a spoof is about not entirely bad
<START> it takes a while to get adjusted to the sound of sons of the pioneers but then you thoroughly enjoy it if the soundtrack would be played by an orchestra like max steiner or tiomkin it would lose its folkloric character the music conducts the film everything seems to follow its rhythm the whole cast is excellent ben johnson and harry carey jr are the young men guiding the caravan ward bond is the mormon leader and joanne dru is a flirting actress ford was able to make of what would be an ordinary western something totally different and original showing us the music the dances and most of all the people
