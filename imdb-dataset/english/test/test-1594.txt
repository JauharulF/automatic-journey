<START> this movie was incredible i did not know the back story on it so i needed to let it unfold before me on dvd it had many twists and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting the acting by elaine cassidy was in a word brilliant as well as sally hawkins the storyline is rich with plausible occurrences as well as fresh ideas from the present br br there is truly something about ms cassidy's eyes that leaves a mark this movie is a refreshing look on the way in which we look at the times' and how we view that society a very worthwhile watch
<START> hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade b performance and he delivers a rather good one outside of madsen and hopper the acting is horrid you've seen better at your local high school the sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of b movies the scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes i've ever seen it doesn't even come close to fitting in the movie the script was probably a great 10 page outline but when it comes out to a full length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies madsen left behind i do have to say hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the hummer had me laughing out loud but i don't think that was the intent yes there is a little style and hopper can always draw my interest however the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this
<START> zoey 101 is such a stupid show i don't know if that's because the snooty jamie lynn spears is the prissy star of it or what but i just know that the show sucks it's about a girl and her brother who go to a boarding school the jokes in this show are extremely dull and unfunny and i hate every single character except chase and lola heck the jokes on this show are so unfunny that they make jack black look like monty python this show is without a doubt one of the worst shows on nickelodeon it's right down there with avatar and danny phantom in the pit of shame and if this show was a person with any honor it would hang itself in shame br br 1 10
<START> like for most women this movie is the ultimate chick flick with it's hot chemistry sexy dance and songs i mean timeless classic like i've had the time of my life the wonderful she's like the wind makes this movie i adore patrick swayze in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance it's so hot he sings she's like the wind in the movie the chemistry between swayze and co star jennifer grey is amazing i love all the dancing and everything that goes with it but saying this dirty dancing 2 havana nights is also great but patrick swayze scenes makes this i love the songs dancing and everything about it but it isn't dirty dancing like i said it's an amazing chick flick please let there be a 3rd because i love to see what happens with patrick's character johnny jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey patrick makes up for that if you know what i mean great movie and i'm so pleased billy zane didn't win the movie role i heard whispers he was meant for the role but they found out he couldn't dance
<START> jamie foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful voyage through the life of the blind emotionally troubled african american genius of pop jazz mr ray charles though the entire cast performs wonderfully mr foxx earned more than simply an oscar if it were possible to nominate an actor in consecutive years i would consider doing so for mr foxx foxx doesn't just play charles he re creates him cj sanders and sharon warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of ray's mother the inspiration of his life and young ray these two provided the strongest support in the film br br the dramas of charles' struggles with guilt the death of his younger brother and mother blindness discrimination addiction and success are neatly woven into the tapestries of his music the music is beautiful the script is as far as i can tell perfect and the acting is nothing short of legendary br br the directorial method of the film warrants discussion taylor a director i am generally ambivalent about had to choose what aspects of the larger than life and complex life story of mr charles would tell his story most honestly dramatically and understandably though some disagree seemingly wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic i believe he selected his themes admirably a big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few persistent themes in charles' life his profound love and respect for his mother his need to be loved and accepted his addiction and guilt complex his musical genius and his deep seated fear of responsibility for others charles is depicted as a man struggling valiantly against an army of personal demons i learned more than i could have imagined about one of the men i used to listen to on my old turntable with my dad in his on sunday nights while football games were on the tv and nothing was sugar coated in ray the themes are carried forward with power and human dignity these themes create a unifying drama which span the length of his long and illuminated life the power of these themes the strong script and directing the music and the acting make this one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographical films i have seen br br recommended for everyone
<START> this movie was one if not the best movie i've seen in the past year i highly recommend it it starts off as a very funny movie but as the film turns into so much more do yourself a favor and see this film i saw a screener of this movie but i am going to buy it not only for myself but for several true film fans i have the unfortunate feeling this great film will be widely unrecognized as is the case with so many other non commercial films this is a comedic yet heart wrenching movie it will make you laugh it will make you cry it will make you think and yes you will think about it when its over and isn't that what a good movie is
<START> this is like something i have never seen before it had me cracking up the whole time i don't think there was one scene that i didn't laugh through it is about a girl from the country in south who goes off to a big town for college at the school she befriends the ra across the hall when she realizes that he has no family to go to for thanksgiving she invites him to come home with her and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and realizes what her boyfriend is about to do propose she urges to do something so he stands up and shouts something like sorry mate but you are too late i already asked to marry me a couple of weeks ago back at the school and she said yes that all turns into chaos please watch this classic it is totally worth it i swear
<START> firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of kung fu starring gordon liu i mention this as my kung fu theater presents dvd has a totally misleading picture on the cover the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention no idea why the young hero starring hwang jang lee apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style the hero is lee shao who i have never heard of before or any of the other actors the film mentions another director wu yuen ling as well as the one imdb lists the other actors are wang fu wang wing san chen fei fei wang ki san king kai and yue who seem to have sunk without trace after this film the fights are reasonable and frequent but not great and the 'star' doesn't have much charisma the twist at the end is just stupid and the film seems to end abruptly as though they got bored with it the scenery and the training sequences in the river are a little different from usual unfortunately the pretty sister gets drowned not the very irritating though acrobatic young boy
<START> love and human remains is one of those obviously scripted obviously acted obviously staged flicks which is so obvious that the escape velocity from its contrivances and fabrication is beyond me not worth explaining this amateurish flick tries to cram every clever line every misanthropic overtone every peculiar sexual predilection into one film with an absence of concern for making the pieces fit in short sensationalistic crap without the sensation which pretty much just leaves crap
<START> how do you know if a movie is good or not it is the impact it has on you that makes the difference dead man walking upset me a great deal i watched it twice i don't know if i will be strong enough to watch it again no i did not feel good at all after watching it but the film was as successful as it can be br br robbins did a great job in incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic he avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective i hope that many people get to see dead man walking i believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the movie br br i don't know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this relic from ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore br br the movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty it describes reality the reality is the best argument against the death penalty br br a 10 10 for great performances good filmmaking and for the most important film made in years br br thank you tim robbins br br
<START> i saw this movie yesterday night and it was one of the best made for tv films i've seen it was very well directed and the acting was superb very convincing the music was good and the cinematography was beautifully shot take out the hopelessness out of requiem for a dream and you get wasted an excellent depiction of the world of drug addiction and its consequences given in a very open way in wich anyone can relate to cudos to mtv for giving us a good flick for a change from like crossroads
<START> hoot is the best movie go and see it if you haven't about these 3 kids that stand up to the right and the wrong a perfect family film the characters mullet fingers cody beatrice brie larson and roy eberhardt logan lerman are the three main characters great movie the best i love this movie and you guys should too its a great movie i mean it a great movie go and see it if you haven't i like it because they stand up to the right and wrong and it has cut owls and the hot cody br br cody is so hot i love him so much
<START> very suspenseful surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students themselves and then being to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond joel schumacher directs with some skill creating some very eerie scenes as well as particularly beautiful ones the visions of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which awaits us all when we go thanks to screenwriter peter who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story while the creativity of the story is impressive the story has many holes as well particularly in the logic department and believability factors notwithstanding all of that is a good effective film because of the script the direction which again is very surreal at times and the acting which brings four very talented actors and william baldwin together this core of actors acts and reacts off each other very nicely keifer sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group the one who comes up with the idea to die and be born again he also manages to portray a man a young man with a damaging destructive secret from his past kevin bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group oliver platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears platt has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well yes julia roberts is here too and very good the actors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends i was duly impressed with much of but more than anything else the story affected me the most the scene with that dog hobbling around the street just one of those powerful images evoked as were many of the flashback scenes
<START> ok what to say about maximus br br there are some bad movies that are so horribly awful they circle 'round to awesome there are bad movies that just suck in their own right there are good movies and so so movies and movies that are just fun then there's maximus you can't make a spoiler for this movie because to do that you would have to understand the action enough to comment this particular movie is worse than turkish star wars one and the sequel too those movies are so bad they circle 'round to awesome and they make you feel drunk even if you're stone cold sober circles 'round from bad to awesome but then it doesn't stop there it takes another trip to then 'round again to awesome then finally it sets up a little feudal kingdom on the border of bad and stock footage of paint drying while a harpy screams incoherently if you are into self punishment this movie is for you it actually will cause your brain to hurt
<START> i have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now but having just sat through the film i felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children please don't this is no disney film this film tells us 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your children in my opinion you are too br br the video box describes the film as a for all and the imdb plot outline describes it as a 'family film' i just had to find a definition of 'family film' and came across the following usually consisting of comedies or adventures these films are often based on children's literature and can involve any number of helpful animals friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds all geared to stimulate and appeal to the imagination whatever the situation there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned on the way not an apt description of tarka the otter which contains some thoroughly unpleasant scenes totally unsuitable for young children and an ending that qualifies the film as a 'feel bad' movie the lesson learned as i said life is cruel family entertainment i don't think so unless you hate your family that is br br another review more revealing than this but worth reading can be found by following the reviews' link
