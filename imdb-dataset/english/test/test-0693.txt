<START> had she not been married to the producer jennifer jones would not have been the most obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic tale of an affair between an american soldier and an english nurse set against the backdrop of the first world war her british accent is not perfect and in the fifties it was unusual for a big romantic lead to go to an actress in her late thirties even one as attractive as miss jones especially when she was several years older than her leading man there were a number of beautiful young british actresses in hollywood around this time such as audrey hepburn elizabeth taylor jean simmons and joan collins any of whom might have been more convincing in the role but miss jones had one important attribute they all lacked namely a marriage certificate with david o selznick's name on it in the event the film turned out to be such a turkey that they were doubtless grateful not to have it on their cvs br br the film tells at great length the story of the romance between frederick an american volunteer serving with the italian army as an ambulance driver and catherine a nurse with the british red cross after the italian defeat at the battle of frederick is wrongly accused of being a german spy and sentenced to death the film paints a very harsh picture of italian military justice it would appear that italian courts martial had the power to pass the death sentence after a trial lasting all of thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without allowing the defendant to be legally represented or to speak in his defence frederick manages to escape and to cross the border into neutral switzerland accompanied by the pregnant catherine br br hemingway's novels have not always been a great success when filmed howard hawks succeeded in making a good version of to have and have not a film that is considerably better than the book on which it is nominally based but that is because he largely ignored hemingway's plot and turned the film into a remake of casablanca set in rather than french morocco like the 1943 version of for whom the bell tolls a farewell to arms is overlong and fatally slow moving it is also miscast jennifer jones never makes catherine come to life as for rock hudson his assumed christian name could be unfortunately appropriate he could be as solid as a rock but also as impassive as one and in this film his frederick seems an impersonation of the great stone face despite the passion and emotion inherent in hemingway's plot the emotional temperature is always far too cool the picture has little going for it apart from some attractive picture postcard views of italian and swiss scenery it is hardly surprising that it was not a success and that its failure ended selznick's career as a producer 4 10 br br a goof shortly before the battle of an italian officer states that russia had already concluded a separate peace with germany that battle started in october 1917 at a time when russia was still fighting alongside the allies the russian revolution did not take place until november it was only the october revolution by the old julian calendar the new bolshevik regime signed an armistice with germany in december 1917 but a separate peace was not signed until the treaty of in march 1918
<START> omg another bad film by larry buchanan that guy did not learn to stop did he first he gives us zero budget sci fi movies and lies about famous dead people and now he is exploiting the loch ness monster as being vicious br br the plot is basically about some southerners of the usa pretending to be scottish camping out at loch ness alas out on the fishing hole oops i mean lake of loch ness there is a killer monster that clams itself to be going out of its way to kill people for no apparent reason br br i am surprised that the crew of mst3k never heard of this movie yes it is that bad too
<START> do the writers that conjure up these type of comedies have such empty lives that they have to embody them in tragic shows like this br br why the talented and gorgeous busy phillips is amongst this trash is beyond me i cannot stand the hispanic girl whose accent sounds very fake and is so unfunny and annoying as is the other african american girl with the shrill voice br br the jokes are often stupid the jewish guy yells a lot and the show never goes anywhere one particular episode with the solider looking for love was just terrible br br i don't believe there would be that many working in a looking for love office and only one man of course all of the woman are in tight fitting tops and tons of make up to make up for their lack of talent br br i actually found holly funny in her older shows and i have always admired busy but this show is dumb empty and had nothing going for it
<START> the very first time i saw this i in horror at what was being presented as modern liberated women br br sorry but i cannot relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around loveless sex and the acquisition of gucci prada and louis labels the troubling thing is that some may actually think this is how career women live in nyc it's definitely not these women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and as another reviewer said they act like gold digging br br this is not liberated womanhood and i'm glad it's gone 0 stars and just plain awful
<START> yes i admire the independent spirit of it all but it's like road trip with a bad cast and no budget br br i chuckle when i watch american comedies i don't laugh this movie made me laugh but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high budget american high school pot flicks br br if you want good independent american comedy with pot references go watch kevin smith or richard linklater flicks or something don't waste your time on this piece of movie br br i mean how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot br br and by the way in norway it's called dude where's my pot
<START> the movie is an adaptation of a japanese story by the respected author yukio mishima it simply doesn't make the transition into a credible story about brits and americans br br the story moves sluggishly especially the part where miles and kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship's cutting through the waves and the little route line filling in on the maps while their letters are heard in the film moves so languidly that i even fast forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which although long are not really either passionate or erotic the film did achieve a measure of notoriety when kristofferson's then wife divorced him for extra curricular activities with miss miles during the filming i guess they enjoyed the sex scenes but it isn't quite the same for a viewer br br there are no characters to hang on to the sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable the little kid is detestable kristofferson is amiable enough but he just doesn't have the acting skills to bring much to the role although perhaps we don't really want get too involved with him considering his ultimate fate br br as for the little kid well he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mum's life now this is a really bad crowd they don't just and smoke dope they slip a mickey to a cat and it this is shown in gory detail but of course this is only practice so they can do the same thing to kristofferson br br so the movie mostly moves slowly with no characters to relate to and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbid br br the ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you'll ever see br br this all might have made some sense if the japanese locale and cultural context had been retained as it stands it is just abysmal br br
<START> hey i didn't order no cab yeah well you got one what can i say about hack what a man among men he was a heartened ex cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold if you were able to and fortunately for america's tv viewers one person per week was penetrate the cold hard surface of exterior you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice the show was superb i laughed i cried i smiled all in the same episode my arms would break out in goosebumps when our dear friend hack would exit his cab in another dark alley with nothing more than his fists ready to avenge a wronged civilian a smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark alley's facial expressions when the taxi of headlights illuminated upon his face week after week i canceled my duties as president of the klingon association to in the warmth glow of brilliance i have never seen a better show and i mourned the loss of one of america's greatest treasures when the show was canceled in other hack related news i would like to announce to the world that my wife and i are expecting hack koen to come into the world in about three weeks
<START> the movie razor blade smile has an interesting title as well as leading role now most may not like this movie for the plot and acting was a little cheap but that is the appeal of a movie like razor blade smile in a way it was suppose to be bad movie br br however if you watch this movie all the way through the end you'll see it is as i said a cheap vampire flick with a little humor also how they manipulated colours in a few scenes is very interesting br br so in conclusion this movie is a type you rent and laugh at with your friends and enjoy it for what it is for no movie is throughly bad br br as lilith silver says humans just don't smile enough
<START> ben stryker an ex green beret stops off at a little town called to visit an old friend tick rand soon after riding into town on his suzuki and settling in a motorcycle gang known as 'the who's led by tyrant invade and finally take over the place stryker doesn't want to get involved but that changes when he friends become the actual targets br br is there anything good to say about this scuzzy item tough call as the only fundamental reason to watch this low budget car wreck is for the tremendous b cast the crew managed to get hold off for this project while i don't think it's a complete botch job it's not terribly good either now what a cast lance henriksen being the main character he strangely doesn't have top billing but the final one karen black george kennedy richard lynch bill forsythe mickey jones and leo gordon now what went wrong with this scummy low budget bungle the shallowness of the material is too one dimensional that it heavily borrows ideas from better movies namely mad max and comes up with a complete mess of ideas that just don't gel and could have been better thought out the clichÃ©s that are used can be manipulated into a good viewing despite being predictable but savage dawn seems to let it rush all by without letting the viewer soak it all up the cast are mostly wasted in nothing roles a bleached blonde henriksen is capably solid and even with his commending presence that provides an enigmatic glow to his character he doesn't get up to hell of a lot and sometimes goes missing in action too much sideline action but when he did kick some ass the good times flowed karen black's hissing performance is a very odd one and is all about the screaming and cursing although she does get into one memorable catfight with claudia flirtatious vixen character katie a wheelchair bound george kennedy roams around aimlessly until the final assault and richard lynch looks embarrassed as a wayward priest town mayor in a very redundant role an on edge bill forsythe simply chews it up as the head honcho of the notorious biker pack br br the junky story written by william milling and max bloom has that cheesy comic book and very much is influenced by the western genre just look at the villains for that how they came up with their names is mystery maybe they drew them out of a hat it's pretty second rate material that more often moves onto one lacklustre scene after another unfunny comical elements are chucked in and as well a bit of sleaze tacky exploitation that doesn't get gritty enough and the deaths are quite laughable a clumsy script is filled convoluted details and unbearable trite simon spotty direction was by the numbers and tepidly laid out one or two intense scenes can't makeup for its tortoise like pacing and many cack handed stunts the cardboard sets had down 'n dirty look but lack that organic sense the gravel like cinematography by gerald was better handled when the main focus wasn't on the town but on the desolate backdrop like the beginning and ending climax of the film with some neat camera touches pino clunky music choices are drowned out by its own incompetence br br savage dawn is a forgettable quickie midnight movie that's a definite misfire for most part there are better and more convincing exercises of the same ilk out there
<START> leonard nimoy directed star trek iii which wasn't half bad maybe william shatner thought seeming as how nimoy did it he could after seeing this film he should have reversed that decision br br star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain br br the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards she looked like she was taking part in a granny competition if they meant to make her look sexy they were wrong she looked grotesque br br how this got to production or even written well it dosen't bear thinking about the only place good for this film is in the garbage the worst one of the series
<START> imagine a film the complete opposite of lawrence of arabia instead of having an all male cast it has an all female cast instead of being set in the barren deserts of arabia it is set in the bulging metropolis of new york city and instead of it being one of the greatest films ever made it is one of the most pointless boring and forgettable br br the film concerns mary haines meg ryan a perfect wife and mother the envy of all others in her high society manhatten social circle she is painted as a women bearing the weight of the world on her shoulders despite the fact she needs a live in nanny and housekeeper to cope with her one child but i don't want to be too hard on her mary does all this whilst taking a faire attitude towards the fashion designing job her father has given her this idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever though and things start to crash in a very real way br br mary's husband is cheating on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough she is quite naturally upset and breaks down a little br br mary needs to bounce back though for the sake of her impressionable young daughter and for herself she does this through rehab hair straightening and designing her own line of clothes though amazingly for this kind of film not a montage mary succeeds her daughter loves her her mother loves her her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now she decides to take her cheating husband back after realising it was her fault he cheated as she didn't dote on him enough br br the films one saving grace is that it doesn't go down the all men are evil route
<START> trading on the success of the 1975 hit this film is a cheaply made story of a plantation where gets down with the slave women and the missus gets down with the big black stud and with son also in fact there is so much getting down going on that i really don't know why anyone bothered to get dressed br br so if you want to see white women rolling their naked bodies all over tied up slaves or you just like a movie with tits on display every five minutes then this one is for you br br there is a funny sad story in here but it only comes at the very end so as to not interfere with all the hot sweaty sex going on on the plantation
<START> i'm new to gaming but i would have started much sooner if this film had been around i caught it at gen con last year a trip made only as a favor to my husband and loved it even to a non gamer like i was at the time it's funny and accessible so much so that i finally relented and started sitting in on my husband's gaming group br br i don't want to give away any plot details but if you're a gamer you need to see this film and if you're not you're going to have a great time despite yourself there are certainly in jokes but the vast majority of the film is accessible to anyone br br my only complaints wish it were longer and wish it were available on dvd soon perhaps
<START> a sadly predictable clichÃ©d story about a woman who was no better than she should have been sadly too the screenplay is by the once great experimental novelist john dos from an original by french exotic potboiler pierre this time marlene dietrich is concha a manipulative cold hearted spanish beauty don pasqual lionel atwill raises her from the cigarette factory but she ditches him he warns his tall young friend antonio cesar romero against her but to no avail a duel ensues concha reproaches for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for so he doesn't he points his pistol at the sky but antonio shoots him but instead of going off to paris with the young victor she goes back to the man who would have died for her with an unexpected bit by edward everett horton as a spanish governor dietrich plays the part of a spanish woman by moving constantly twisting at the waist and posturing and then twisting back tossing her head and so forth and she makes faces and has a curl in the middle of her forehead the photography is strangely crowded no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room no consecutive scene of dietrich can be shot without a major wardrobe change the carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it's almost like an underwater scene in the sargasso sea
<START> this is primarily about love in wwii yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life br br the movie's timing is just great it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed while it may prove boring to some the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it br br at one point my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors cillian murphy is on fine form here as is matthew rhys both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch the relationship formed between sienna miller and keira knightley's characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank and watch out for a cameo by of 'madness' br br despite all of this it's a rather slow movie coupled with the fact it's just shy of two hours it's quite a slog to get to the conclusion br br overall it's a solid non fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well known british names behind the scenes but it really does drone on for too much at times still a worthwhile watch 7 10
