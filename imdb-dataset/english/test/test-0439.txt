<START> this is the first sci fi series that i have seriously become hooked on since star trek and i haven't watched trek in years it takes the invasion theme in somewhat different directions but has done it in a very exciting way it also borrows from soap opera format where it continues the arc throughout the entire year run of the series the cgi definitely doesn't overcome the plot or the characters except for the fledgling creature who is a pet with definite attitude anything that would show what he really thought about the neighbor's dog is a 1 in my book he was a stroke of genius br br i am left at the end of the finale asking questions intelligent ones i hope and crossing my fingers and toes that nbc or someone else sci fi maybe will continue to run the series and answer those questions br br a really great classy show
<START> no spoilers br br after hitchcock's successful first american film rebecca based upon daphne lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early british period mistaken identity and espionage as the u s settled into world war ii and the large scale 'war of civilians building planes weaponry and other necessary militia the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes these thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good law abiding citizens knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre producer jack approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption war time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in nyc who co authored the script were a perfect match for hitchcock's sensibilities br br this often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old barry kane robert cummings who while at work at a los angeles airplane factory meets new employee frank frye norman and moments later is framed for committing sabotage fleeing the authorities who don't believe his far fetched story he meets several characters on his way to soda city utah and finally new york city these memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks' and a popular billboard model patricia martin priscilla lane who during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security he falls madly in love with of course in the land of hitchcock patricia kidnapped by the supposed saboteur barry falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix br br in good form for this outing hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies average joes and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving it's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited culminates in one of hitchcock's more memorable finales look for incredibly life like nyc tourist attractions all of which were recreated by art directors in hollywood due to the war time on public attractions while saboteur may not be one of hitchcock's most well known films it's a popular b movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual terrific hitchcock villains remember to look for hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film hitchcock's original cameo idea that was shot him fighting in sign language with his wife was axed by the bureau of standards and practices who were afraid of offending the deaf
<START> i like to like movies but i found nothing to like about the box i was interested in the of the plot but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably faking it so that they can feel like they are a part of something well i have news for them the emperor has no clothes br br the only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin and corrupting mankind i've heard that story before and it makes less and less sense every time it's true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres but that doesn't make it worth the ticket price
<START> i'm just getting the chance to dig into past austen films and i picked this up because persuasion is has been and always will be my favorite work by jane austen and anne elliot my favorite austen heroine so it was with great anticipation that i popped the disc into my player br br i wasn't disappointed either i knew there were bound to be some draw backs so i'll state them and try not to be too thick about them anne elliot is the most introverted of austen's characters she is the least talkative and the least witty there are passages in the book where anne says nothing only her feelings are described this works fine in print but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen short of doing thoughtful voice overs which would grow tedious over four hours you're left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing and must communicate all by her facial expression this can leave the feeling that the film is slow and lacking in purpose if you need a more overt style of austen then certainly this film is not for you but if subdued is more your style and you tend to pick up on unspoken this will fulfill all expectations br br anne as anne elliot is thankfully an actress whose face can convey much she looked as i had always imagined anne elliot would look not a knockout anne wasn't supposed to be the elegant one of the family nor in her first youth which is also highlighted occasionally by the lighting and make up what you see is someone who is very like austen's character someone whose appearance you might pass over once but hear her speak and look more closely and she grows more attractive the better you know her this is anne elliot as brought to life by anne br br captain wentworth's portrayal is ably handled by bryan marshall the bitterness is never apparently obvious save at the concert scene and yes i found it hard to believe he wound find louisa musgrove interesting as she was shown but that is another point of austen's book he did not find her interesting he tried to find her interesting and ultimately failed sigh of relief so this too fits with austen's original story br br i especially liked the portrayal of lady russell who i thought in the book was not portrayed as truly bad this also comes out in this adaptation br br so this is one film which closely followed the book i could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced but i'd run out of space here charles musgrove remained one of the most buoyant characters good fun mary the most annoying i was dying to have her just shut up but i had that feeling when i read the book too captains and the admiral i thought charming br br the cinematography i thought a trifle stiff there was little or practically no fade from one screen to another perhaps this is due to it being a tv movie one scene chop the next scene the actors enter from right proceed left and chop another scene where the same thing happens this was the only part of the movie which i felt cheated me a little a low budget has to show itself somewhere i suppose br br and as i said earlier if you like some pace to go with jane austen don't bother with this one as you'll find it way too slow i enjoyed it enormously though as it brought a wealth of detail the sets were richly elegant to an excellent adaptation of my favorite austen novel i highly recommend it
<START> i've seen professional reviews claiming julia roberts playing herself was clever and very funny i think not an actress playing herself and doing it with her same usual dizziness whenever she tries comedy talk about hollyweird narcissism at it's utmost why doesn't she just stand there and go me me me look at me the director and writer should be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a charming sequel and by the way steven when the audience starts paying more attention to the weird camera angles then the story you have a problem capra hitchcock all used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera you seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of film making in the name of style the pitt and zeta jones chemistry is quite good however perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with the narcissism it might have worked once again zeta jones shows how she's got more talent and beauty then roberts could dream of sadly this film wastes talent and fails on many accounts i want my money back
<START> it is playing on showtime right now but is going to be released as a movie called three or has been released for 2006 mess ups include a supposed nude body comes out of the waves with her bottoms on you can have fun finding the others it was a decent stranded hungry cold crazy person video but that is about it and of course what would a movie be without sex the lady has a nice body and the men are pretty but the story is the same as swept away or a savage is loose type with some blood wonder if the movie studios know they made a big booboo and already released this show and now gonna release it as three billy zane should have worn a top hair piece or shaved his head completely juan di pace is awesome and there is a couple good sex scenes there is a voodoo woman that loves the character di pace plays and in real life her name is di pace too not aware of any connection but probably kin or married
<START> someone asked why it was canceled i tell you why because reality makes money the show surface was canceled so that they could replace it with a reality show this will haunt nbc i and about half of my high school about 1000 people total have vowed to boycott nbc until they bring this show back in my area i don't know about other places but they had a great thing going with the sci fi channel where the sci fi channel would show last weeks episode at 7 00 and then nbc would show the week's new episode at 8 00 this was great because it gave you a little refresher as to what happened in the last episode i was so angry when i learned that the show was canceled and they were going to just leave them on top of the church like that
<START> pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie nor is it terrible br br the acting was wooden at least on pinocchio's part the puppet had all of 2 expressions as did most of the actors except strangely enough the secondary characters most of them were enjoyable over the top br br the special effects in this are pretty b and as i said earlier the puppet really blew br br the 2 best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand looked pretty good i think they spent about a 1 3 of the budget on that and the shower scene wow i think they must have spent the other 2 3rds of the budget on talking the actress who did that scene to do it outstanding br br seriously this is a slightly below average b horror puppet movie rent chucky if you have a urge to see puppets kill br br the story had a few interesting idea's enough to keep me watching it to the end
<START> i saw this movie on pbs the first time then i bought the video and watched it countless times every time i watch it i can get something else out of it it's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good but now the world is changing but you don't have to be older to hold onto the past even the young characters like charlotte don't want things to change the overall tone and mood is excellent the cast is outstanding with all stars like kathy bates beau bridges and arthur kennedy and its fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films like kevin j o'connor the mummy and vincent d'onofrio men in black and law order criminal intent one of my favorite shows its just one of those movies that stays with you
<START> i've become a big fan of the carpenters and i didn't really enjoy this movie br br i feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true personality shine through i wasn't overly fond of cynthia gibb's portrayal especially knowing she decided karen's anorexia was suicide which it clearly wasn't although her family was not big on hugs and kisses i thought the movie portrayed agnes their mother as being terrible br br i did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier i thought the metaphor so to speak there was rather effective when the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving which is probably the wrong word as well br br overall i feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly quirky side her genuine personality even as the focus of the film there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia though of course no one can really know and almost made it seem baseless the film was more poor singer with anorexia than karen carpenter's story in my opinion br br i would assume that they changed her husband's name profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him there were some bad terms there but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes on this note i can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband br br on the whole it ends up as a low budget made for tv movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond karen's disease i feel that such a legend deserves deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice
<START> dr pena giancarlo esposito a zoologist fancy term for one of those self deluded losers who likes to study extremely rare read nonexistent animals and his crew of hunters manage to trap a a big elusive fast moving beast to get it to the mainland they smuggle it on a cruise ship and some idiots open up the crate containing it despite being told specifically not to i guess the strange growling noises coming from inside weren't a good enough deterrent either the monster then does the monster thang running around biting chunks out of various passengers until the ship's captain john rhys davies a square jawed special agent pretending to be an insurance salesman for some reason dylan neal a squeaky voiced blonde tai bo instructor simmons a bunch of guys with machine guns and others try to stop it the main victims who i think are supposed to be the comic relief but it's hard to tell are an old rich bitch paula shaw with a terrier and a snobby effete gold digger david apparently the monster can be knocked out with a single tranquilizer dart but can live through dozens of bullet hits the design is acceptable though unoriginal but the rest of the movie is devoid of suspense surprise or interest a boring sci fi channel original movie they've made dozens of movies just like this with nearly interchangeable characters and plots but with slight alterations on the creature enough already
<START> the ali g show was really something amazing he was so stupid wannabe rapper but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending sasha cohen is actually very intelligent guy who pretends to be stupid so he could get really honest answers from people and it is very funny so i didn't expect movie to be good cause it was all acted no real people or interviews so the basic point of all show was lost but i was wrong i laughed all the time it was one of the funniest films i ever saw sure it was stupid but who cares if you can't actually brake in to safe with a car battery like someone said it wasn't supposed to be a realistic documentary and it isn't like the show it goes in totally different way but that doesn't mean it is bad when i finished watching i was totally impressed but now when some time passed i realized that it was not that special anyway but it still deserves a nine well at least for what it is supposed to be

<START> excellent story wonderful acting amazing production values and a cool action packed short with a perfect twist at the end what a great short film br br i saw this film in vail or aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it then i saw it again at another festival where it won again and i was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around for a short film this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time br br awol is not for the faint of heart but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film for any film actually it's an interesting story told very well and every scene moves the story which reveals good film making instincts went into making this film the film looks gorgeous and david morse is also stunning with a dynamic performance delivered in every scene watching his character attempt to defeat the life is throwing him makes a great viewing experience br br it also should be noted that when tortures of war are in the headlines everyday the lines between reality good and evil can get very gray while the rhetoric gets loud and attempts to make things black and white awol smartly allows the audience to decide for themselves what they think the message is what is real and what is not which adds to the mystery br br both times i've seen it the audience was way more into this movie than the others playing with it which is saying a lot there are a lot of shorts out there right now but few deliver the kind of all around excellence and complex subject matter that awol does br br it sounds to me like the previous reviewer is off his or her rocker or has some personal agenda because this really is a great example of short independent film making i see a lot of short films and i must say if only all the shorts making the festival rounds were this good then the shorts business would have some serious legs
<START> the first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting the whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that i started laughing at the awful dialog midway through the film an even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character the one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is innovative visual effects however as eye catching as they may be they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above a dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing i was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was
