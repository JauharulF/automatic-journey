<START> a gentle story hinting at fury with a redemptive message and glorious celebration the photography is wondrously well executed cinematographers look at this kind of film to hone their craft not just for what the eye can do to enhance a story but what the right camera vocabulary can do to heighten an emotion feeding the soul is by definition what this movie addresses but with an elegance and grace of delivery that simply doesn't not happen much anymore at least with this degree of taste restraint and finesse if you care about story and character development this is a also a great movie to see as an example of what simple lines and the right delivery can do to completely fill out a character's impression match all this with a film score that is almost minimalist in character and also perfectly conceived and you'll get this movie
<START> now first let me say i love god awful movies especially horror films mainly i watched hundreds of movies on mystery science theater 3000 with no pain but this is the absolute worst film on the planet i had to turn it off it was so bad it was unfunny and just plain unwatchable give me 3 back to back viewings of manos the hands of fate or monster a go go over this any day avoid this film like the now excuse me while i go gouge out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth i had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film only one decent gag in the part i watched was the now are an extermination pair for exterminators even that wasn't to great of a gag
<START> this was a thoughtful and well shot and directed tv movie that took on a huge subject with precision and intelligence and gives it a film treatment that would look great on a bigger screen the palette is a little muted for tv if you're looking for a war action film or bosnia lite this isn't for you it's about an ordinary woman who took on an extraordinary challenge for humanity if you want to learn more about the conflict and how the work of one woman influenced the world in a massive way watch this film when it comes your way i don't see that a lot of other tv films have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level the story avoids obvious demonization of the bad guys and instead shows the denial and everyday hatred that resulted in deaths of thousands i was moved at several points and not in some manipulative hollywood way with driving music and flashy mise en scene but allowed to discover the horror and implications along with the characters this is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself and keep the visuals understated to support it with dignity br br the actors do a helluva job at bringing the intense dramatic scenes to life the scenes where victims give their testimony before the war tribunal are powerful and wendy crewson and heino ferch are excellent william hurt's british accent is awful no one else has given him a chance to play a brit and when he finally has it he blows it and although john corbett's body was born to play a soldier commando he's a little too gee whiz nice although he does a good job
<START> a truly terrific touching film female melodrama at its finest with a lot of comedy great dialogue characters and writing any woman can relate to the story because it's a classic you're in love with mr right but he has no interest in you until some guy who seems completely wrong comes along and you fall head over heels in love but of course it's not that simplistic the characters are real and all of the performances are perfect the movie is hilarious as well every scene skewers society i'd recommend this film to anyone who loves a well written screenplay of humor and melodrama you can relate to every character and the plot moves in unexpected directions a great underrated movie
<START> long before terri brought the issue of living as a vegetable to the public view a day in the death of joe egg dealt with it alan bates plays bri a schoolteacher whose daughter is almost completely he and his wife sheila janet try all sorts of dark humor to try and get on with their lives but they can't escape the facts at one point they even consider euthanasia the question circling them and their friends is what will ever become of this predicament br br with this movie alan bates continued his streak of really good movies preceded by zorba the greek the king of hearts and the fixer we can safely say that he will be sadly missed
<START> claudine is a movie that is representation of the american system at it's worst the welfare system was initially set up as a stepping stone for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet the movie showed an accurate portrayal of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit in other words if the father or any male figure is in the lives of the women and children their financial support from the system would be jeopardized if not terminated the struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world i would like to see a reproduction of this movie back in the stores for all to rent or buy for their library collection
<START> i didn't like this movie for many reasons very boring it was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this but seriously i was very bored watching this there was hardly any action although the classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice the visuals were very creative whenever this movie pops on tv i feel like changing the station instantly not because it is a bad movie just because i know what i am in for when watching this complete and total boredom it is a movie i saw when i was young but i never got into the science fiction thing because it simply wasn't real just like this movie very unrealistic i never understood half the movie anyway
<START> my mom would not let me watch this film when i was in grade 2 because she said it was too violent well years later and the only reason i remember this film is because of my mom i stayed up and watch it on pbs well maybe the build up after all these year lead to the big of this film but i found it lame it did not age well and this made the acting choppy huge unbelievable holes in the script but there is a few cool scenes like car chases and a big gun fight i will not stay up for this film again
<START> i was really surprised that my mom watched whole movie without leaving to iron clean or some other things like these and i was almost shocked when she said it was very funny and very interesting and i think so
<START> i saw this film when it first came out and didn't know what to expect exactly what followed the overture was one of the most pleasurable filmgoing experiences i have ever had a lush score of songs and music by leslie of doctor doolittle wonka and the chocolate factory fame as well as making his mark on the broadway musical scene and scored by the incomparable john williams there's not a bad song in the entire film plus some of the most exquisite cinematography costume design and filming locations i have ever seen in one film not to mention the academy award nominated performance by peter o'toole and the equally strong performance in my opinion by the wonderful clark now given that peter is not the same caliber a singer that is he still manages to sell his songs to the audience and that after all is what it is all about this is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by james hilton and deserves to be treasured for generations to come i recommend this film for family viewing though most men will consider this a flick but if you like a truly great film musical then this film is for you but be warned that a standby box of kleenex is just as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure
<START> back in the 1960's those of us who were bad movie aficionados thought that plan nine from outer space was the worst movie ever made and would remain so for all time to put things in perspective though we also thought that 3 000 was a lot to pay for a new car br br as we grew older our innocence was gradually stripped away as we were exposed to movies like hercules in new york and overdrawn at the memory bank which completely redefined the bad movie genre in this context last night my son and i saw alien from l a which pushed the envelope to an extreme unimaginable just a generation ago to call this movie bad or wretched or execrable completely fails to do it justice as does any other label existent in the english language even if there were words with which to accurately describe this movie it would be of no consequence since they would be banned in civilized society br br the alien referred to in the title is played by kathy ireland who apparently took some time off from modeling swimsuits for sports illustrated to kick off her cinematic career her casting might seem some sort of recommendation until you actually see the movie the makeup artists earned their money by making kathy look so drab and unappetizing you would not want to touch her with the far end of a broomstick no mean feat to put it bluntly in this movie she has a face that would freeze medusa even worse than her look though was her voice which was so raucous that i initially failed to credit it as originating with a human being throughout the movie i found myself longing for a chalkboard to drag my nails across to cover the screechy twang of her dialog at the end of the movie kathy finally gets a makeover and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit i suggested to my son that the movie would have been better if they had put her in the swimsuit at the beginning of the movie so at least we would have had something to watch my son perceptively pointed out that if they had then removed the swimsuit and stuffed it into her mouth it would have considerably improved the movie on two counts i defer to the plain brilliance of his observation if you have any doubts compare this dreck to barbarella in which a competent filmmaker shows how to exploit the assets of an ethereally beautiful leading lady in the fantasy genre br br of the plot itself there is little on which to comment since there was so little in evidence it is said that if a million monkeys typed for millions of years eventually one would come up with hamlet by the process of elimination the rest of the time they would come up with something this screenplay imagine if you will a modern day alice falling into a hole and dropping 500 feet onto a rock slab following which she gets up herself off and starts looking for her long lost father in the city kingdom of atlantis once in atlantis she spends most of her time running fighting or climbing stairs and ladders and basically trying to keep out of the hands of a general who seems to have no soldiers to do his bidding and who would make tiny tim look macho this summation as abbreviated as it appears is probably longer than the shooting script br br on the plus side as you revel in the production values and take in whatever you can of the sets and costumes through the smoke and haze you realize that this is one movie in which you can actually see on the screen where all 20 of the budget went br br the thought that kept going through my mind was that filmmakers ought not be given access to drugs and alcohol while they are shooting a movie or perhaps prior if it leads to results like alien from l a though in fairness i have to acknowledge that i don't know whether they were actually involved in substance abuse or were simply brain dead at the outset of the project
<START> i just got back from the film festival at the amc loews 34th in ny a friend told me about this film audience response was very positive lots of good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization top notch in every area a movie that makes you think and then makes you realize how lucky we'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt i imagine this will come close to if not win the audience favorite award what was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to satirize there isn't any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with
<START> the lousiest of all lousy jaws rip offs was regretfully made by one of my all time favorite directors lamberto bava here under his john old jr pseudonym you know how it goes in these cheap european imitations right they only want their monstrous animal to be be bigger sicker and more threatening but this more than often results in the opposite effect bava's creature is a humongous sea devil and it's more than just a shark we're seemly dealing with a prehistoric monster here with the jaws and appetite of a great white but it also has tentacles like an octopus it's up to a couple of dolphin loving to discover how this monster was able to survive all these thousands of years and why exactly he only started his killing spree now the script of monster shark makes few to no sense and most of the action takes place on the mainland the shark itself is an unintentionally laughable creation and it was a wise decision of lamberto bava to only show it vaguely and in quick flashes the acting performances are above average and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well handled the twists in the plot are predictable and you'll probably have the most fun spotting detailed facts about the characters for example count all the cans of beer dr hogan drinks throughout the whole movie
<START> a group of douche bag teenagers go up to an old mining town in hopes of finding gold nuggets the one hitch in the hair brained scheme is that the ancient supernatural miner whom the gold belongs to doesn't wish to part with his treasure so easily and so begins to dispatch the interlopers accordingly br br literally clichÃ© dialog horrible acting some insanely terrible and a lame unmemorable killer who resembles jeepers creepers without the predilection of young boys naturally combine to make this stinker just about unwatchable even cult legend actress karen black in a small role can't save this aberration br br eye candy elina madison shows badly lit t a br br my grade d br br where i saw it
<START> directed and written by the famous infamous edward d wood jr using a pseudonym daniel davis playing the lead role of glen glenda this is an almost radical documentary about transvestism wood himself being a transvestite with a fetish for angora sweaters it seems miles of stock footage and an incoherent bela lugosi is used to stretch this odd and awkward film to 67 minutes police inspector lyle talbot seeks enlightenment from a psychiatrist dr alton timothy farrell to better understand the emotional and disposition of transvestites br br also in the cast delores fuller tommy captain and wood's sister evelyn of note farrell also acts as narrator and fuller later helped write songs included in the elvis presley movies blue hawaii cousins kid
