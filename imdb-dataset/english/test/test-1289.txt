<START> i think category 6 day of destruction was very unrealistic the digital effects where like a children's cartoon br br the actors didn't act realistically for example when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce on her br br the movie was boring but i watched it because it was on br br the only interesting character was tornado tommy he was funny br br please keep the special effects real br br i liked the comment what did we do to p i s s off mother nature br br i don't know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines what else can i say the movie is so boring i think my comment will be equally boring
<START> this film held my interest enough to watch it several times the plot has holes but the lead performers make it work br br catherine mary stewart julia does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician she worked years to earn the money to go to medical school she is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream br br meanwhile julia's sister and brother in law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda arlen stewart to avoid having her become a ward of the state amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance amanda is so traumatized from her parent's murder that she has become mute needless to say julia's 16 hour days get longer caring for amanda br br rob lowe plays kevin finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda he is always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for julia br br the chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film the chemistry between rob and arlen was good as well arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other you can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses br br we discover that julia's sister and brother in law the meyers were involved in industrial espionage they stole an extremely valuable prototype from their employer they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed br br in any case the meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates the killers make no attempt to extract the location of the from the meyers before killing them the killers search the home and fail to find their prize they leave a living witness to their crime amanda the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located eventually the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the location br br eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guys the predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together br br what struck me about the plot were major holes kevin moves into the same apartment building as julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers how does he know that the is not already in the hands of the killers the killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene with no concern for concealing their identity the killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film there are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention br br the film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort
<START> it's generally an accepted fact that marcel carnÃ©'s 1936 1946 movies are masterpieces and it's considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrities this is an unfair opinion at least two of the latter era are eminently watchable his best post war work and les the cheats br br there's a strange evolution from the prevert golden hour to les in les enfants du paradis quai des brumes or le jour se lÃ¨ve true love is thwarted by the villains in les true love does not exist anymore we deal with a bunch of young people who believe in nothing falling in love would be incongruous for this youth the adults are not the villains at all brother and mother are kind people but she is beyond their command very few grown ups appear anyway br br during two hours the characters do not stop playing around dancing listening to jazz records a music which was not still part of the bourgeois culture and heavily drinking when two of them discover they care for each others it will be too late br br the cast is rather good laurent as an existentialist cynic and as a rich kid are the stand outs on the other hand pascale petit and mainly jacques who married brigitte bardot the same year as les do not possess the ambiguity their parts ask for they are all smile too sweet and to nice to be believable br br oddly les was labeled nouvelle vague when you know what the priests of this cinema school the likes of godard thought of carnÃ© it's really a good joke but this disenchantment you feel throughout the whole movie is really disturbing
<START> from a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values this one is definitely worthwhile this is the second bruce willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity off color humor profanity or gratuitous violence i refer of course to the sixth sense both movies are engaging on more than one level this one is appropriate for children as well although as others have pointed out it isn't a flick for kids br br i was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained except that we know russell himself initiates it as a 70 year old also why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight why if as his older self says he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time and why he doesn't learn to kick butt in the process i also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage br br good use of the red plane as metaphor however

<START> my husband and i both loved this film at first my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got for sitting through this one but after a few key scenes he was totally sucked in and by the end he was convinced it was one of the best movies going kathleen bates has never been so wonderfully loveable and the rest of the cast is just simply fantastic thank you for this beautiful film
<START> rock star' is not on its way to any stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time but it does make you from time to time because of its high level energy the film's theme is on a die hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band the story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band judas priest if you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction then you got another thing however what did shook me all night was the fine acting of jennifer aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend i could not say the same about the rock star himself mark wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star i did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie it reminded me of my teenage years where everything smelled like teen spirit' i guess the film is worth a viewing but for you to have a better time watching it make sure you bring along some girls girls girls ' average
<START> i just cant see what everyone sees in this movie the acting is just awful the choice of music is mildly putting it peculiar there arent enough fighting scenes the plot is non existent and whatever small entertainment one could get from this film is ruined by the annoying way some of the movie is filmed and gives you a splitting
<START> this person is a so called entertainer who has to resort to profanity vulgarity and slander to try and make others believe he has talent i have often seen comics use a little of each with effect but when all you can say is laced with it it is a sign of a drug affected warped mind makes me wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be in a few more years of abuse poor man i admit i could not watch all of it too stupid for words the amazing part of this is that somebody actually believes he is a philosopher no wonder self respect and decency are dwindling and perversity is rising could it be that the might have been a factor in his deadened brain
<START> this is sweet the actress who played the nurse with the is the same actress who plays elvira mistress of the dark another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of roy in king pin this is most glorious story ever to be told it should sell more copies than the bible my parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater the movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it the lady who gave the go ahead friend of the family was let go by the theater i was 3 years old i have burned through 4 copies on vhs and finally had it converted to dvd it's beautiful
<START> this movie was borderline in crude humor i utterly can not believe that these people can get away with this johnny knoxville didn't cross the line he was stomping all over it this was better than the first all tha way the thing i found about the 1st movie was that the shenanigans were somewhat as if it was on the t v show not this time they completely made a 180 degree flip the whole cast is so outstanding in what they do and not were the stunts crazy but the music basically fit every situation good work when you go see this be sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater maintain a strong stomach and to not let your beverage spray out your nose
<START> i loved this film fantastically original and different a solid intense hard core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of dark humor if you're tired of the typical overdone ridiculous hollywood b s movies how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take then this film is for you fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable and solid performances by all actors not a weak character or performance in the film skip woods' film is a breath of fresh air and i applaud his originality and efforts his film has the feel of a cross between a quentin tarantino and a cohen brothers film not a bad mix at all in my opinion this movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go there's nothing boring or bubble gum about this film the only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it everyone i've recommended it to has thanked me and shared my opinion on it this film is a welcomed change alternative from the canned hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today even with their big name actors big explosions special effects and huge budgets it's a terrifically wild intense violent graphic humorous and raw i mean that in a good way no phony hollywood polish here ride thank you to everyone involved in making this film happen you did an incredible job
<START> previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than i could what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense emotionally visually just gorgeous br br if you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art br br on a scale of 1 to 10 i'd give it about an 8 75 the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece if you are in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then it's a 10 i definitely think it's a must see but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall 8 75
<START> i've never read a good review for vanity fair and i can't understand why for something that was rushed through in ten days it all comes off surprisingly well though admittedly becky sharp is a better movie and miriam hopkins a better becky there's nothing to stop this one from getting a solid 9 10 at times myrna loy might seem just too cute and nice to be playing an utter bitch but at other times she just has to squint her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees meow the move to a more modern setting did not work against vanity fair and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting barbara kent amelia was under 5 feet in height and few of the leading men were very tall either this all coming together to make loy look like an absolute amazon woman br br vanity fair is similar to craig's wife in that no matter how bad the main character is you have to love her and you know she deserves her comeuppance and then some but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it though based on the same story as becky sharp this version had a different ending which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical for pleasure value the ending of becky sharp is ultimately more enjoyable although aesthetically and from the flow of the story there is no doubt that the ending of vanity fair is the better one whether or not you actually like it
<START> this is one of the better sci fi series it involves character development a few really moments and reasonable episode scripts as one other commentator said here it looked as if it were a mini series not a full blown series with filler episodes and low budgets br br the problem with the show which in short is a godzilla series is that it started too big with incredible monsters fantastic science then it all boiled down to local americans doing stuff then the show ended too soon since the olympics were coming and hey a sci fi show is a sci fi show but half naked athletic people running around aimlessly is much more important so they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22 the audience was small too as people didn't really caught it on at 20 00 in the end the suits did it trust a marketing plan to destroy anything that looks remotely original and promising br br conclusion you have a show with good special effects stuff like huge monsters killing people or destroying boats then going into genetic engineering transforming people human clones end of the world also the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other annoying people being killed for their stupidity the down side is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge the show ends no real ending no closure just a bitter taste of cloth in one's mouth as if you just swallowed a piece of suit
