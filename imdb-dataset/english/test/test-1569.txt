<START> this is not especially well written the songs are not memorable the cast however squeezes a lot out of this martin and lewis in the navy situation they both look great as young sailors they are believable the scenes on the submarine show how cramped it must have been on those underwater missions in the 1950s and before br br lots of sailors in many scenes hundreds perhaps in a big outdoor exercise field and again in a boxing arena br br you will see james dean in his scene he does stand out even though he is an extra here in a scene where jerry walks across a busy street we see some of his almost accident comedy which he would bring into play years later in the patsy br br dean giving jerry boxing instructions is a good comedy skit to watch for jerry in the boxing ring shows his high energy that was his trademark in the late '40s and early '50s dean and jerry dancing is a bit of a treat not great but better than most non dancing movies br br worth seeing if you don't mind black and white good ending br br tom willett
<START> this is really the only chance to see the magic of james joyce's writing brought to life his novels are all unfilmable in any real sense and this is the only long story he wrote it was john huston's last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died and it is easy to see his touch of greatness the dead is poetical in its approach on the screen telling us more about ireland than any modern movie on the ira and the troubles could ever hope to tell us hopefully more people will watch this film and get to experience the finest of both john huston and james joyce and perhaps visit this story in your local bookstore and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever put on paper
<START> after reading the book heart of darkness the movie did not do it justice the movie puts the book to shame and anyone who has not experienced the book would frown upon the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly by the movie in the film the characters and set were just some of the let downs that occurred in the movie the director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made br br of course any book is better than the movie but these weren't even comparable joseph conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the cleverness of the written word the movie doesn't even start to show any of this some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out like how kurtz was not in the boat when he died also when marlow went to deliver the news to intended she reacted differently in the movie rather than the book another major difference was that marlow saw the picture of the lady that was blindfolded at the end of the movie not at the beginning like the book this was influential on how the audience perceived marlow and the movie totally messed that up br br the book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like but the scenery in the movie was a let down there was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment a bunch of bad actors to go along with it there was one exception to the awful actors and that would be isaach de bankolÃ© who played his character was depicted the best though the movie wasn't that great i still would recommend it only if you have read and understood the book very well that way you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them if you have not read the book i do not recommend the movie because it is a boring lifeless mess i loved the book so you should definitely read it and enjoy it
<START> nbc had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of the ten commandments and the greatest story ever told and instead they chose to make some halfhearted cartoon that was more like waterworld than anything else i don't recall a bible passage where lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark nor do i remember one where noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange nor do i remember noah being some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting nautical terms like hoist the mainstay this was possibly the worst marketing decision in history obviously the majority of people watching this were going to be jewish and christian parents with their kids so why on earth make the movie so offensive to those people if they were intentionally trying to offend why not advertise it that way and at least reel in the right audience i hope they make a real noah movie someday one done seriously and thoughtfully one that actually appeals to people and makes money until then don't waste your time with this trash
<START> i love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great american sitcom i watched five episodes of this abomination and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job the rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom i loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots one who got laid and the other who didn't getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students the british girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass the hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot and the principal and her lackey that served to somehow move the almost non existent plot forward i loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young but i ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had did they look like that or did you go to the high school that had middle aged people teaching in it that is the high school that everyone else went to the show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools in public schools principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers the school board does but in every episode that i watched the principal made threats to fire her teachers think back to your history class or think of any history class did you ever see an incredibly hot british chick teach an american history class no did you ever see a teacher's lounge that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in no br br teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality what makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out the overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines and i'm sorry i just didn't buy it the show could have modeled itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single camera format and it should have centered more around the teacher's relationships with their students and not with each other br br it gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick she was really hot br br in the end it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession i only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen
<START> this is a woeful hollywood remake of a classic british film everything that made the original italian job entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie scripted by donna and wayne powers and listlessly directed by f gary gray i am amazed that troy kennedy martin the screenwriter of the original film allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear martin has worked on some of the finest film and tv projects of the last 40 odd years even being vaguely associated with this stinker is not a good thing br br the humour is forced the drama is laboured all the characters are cookie cutter likable crims with the exception of charlize theron's implausible beautiful safe cracker rally driver and the plot only matches the original on the following points br br 1 three minis the modern bmw made versions but minis nonetheless br br 2 use of the names and for 2 of the main characters br br 3 disrupting a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it br br 4 er that's it br br otherwise what you get is a bland and implausible american by the numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate believe me it feels like an awful long time before they do the cast do their best with what they're given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd polishing exercise after reading the script none of the original film's quirky nature and distinctly british flavour has survived being fed into the hollywood hamburger machine br br do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound it's a wonder that noel coward hasn't done an aunt nelly jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats br br italian job more like italian
<START> the production values in this video are so poor that it is unwatchable the performance took second place to the overwhelmingly creative hijinks of the studio with about thirty special effects per minute it is filmed through a cloud of smoke only one or two seconds duration per shot and frequently background spotlights shine directly into the camera the lighting was terrible for filming there is constant zooming in and out with a total lack of visual continuity there may have been some good dancing available to the live audience but the video viewers will never know
<START> after 66 years flash gordon still has an appealing scifi adventure epic feel that many of today's science fiction adventures strive for and fail to deliver the only way to fully enjoy this serial is just to sit back and not pick at anything hokey effects dialogue why flash doesn't go for princess aura etc and as for you older people who saw flash gordon back on the serial screen or on t v back in the day if you want this fine serial to remain appealing to future generations get your kids grandkids to watch this when they're young it worked for me male aged 18 or under 9 out of 10
<START> i suppose i can see why critics give this film two out five stars it isn't fantastic but i think it is worth a look from director shawn levy cheaper by the dozen night at the museum basically 14 year old jason shepherd malcolm in the frankie is often lying to his parents and teachers and his teacher warns him that if he doesn't do his creative writing he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer so he completes his work but getting a lift from hollywood producer marty wolf paul giamatti who hit him on the way to school he manages to leave his paper with the story big fat liar in the car he finds out from a movie trailer that marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie so he and his best friend she's the man's amanda bynes are on a mission to prove jason is for once telling the truth marty of course is too nasty and smug to give jason's father harry michael bryan french a phone call and he burns the big fat liar paper so now jason and are determined to make marty's life as hellish as possible until he agrees to call jason's dad they put blue dye in his swimming pool and orange hair dye in his shampoo and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for marty's career there is the obvious point when jason looks like he wants to give up but don't worry all characters that despise marty help out in the final operation and with jason's parents coming he wants to finally prove his truthfulness and boy does he deliver big style also starring amanda detmer as monty lee majors as vince donald faison as frank jackson sandra oh as mrs phyllis caldwell russell as marcus duncan christine tucci as carol shepherd and american pie's john cho as dustin wong is likable byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support and even though he is wasting his time and talent a little giamatti is great at being nasty it is a kids film so if it seems corny cheesy or predictable just keep that in mind and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick okay
<START> the movie is really about choices in the oppressed state of affairs as seen in fire where good women had to be obedient and do what was correct in the eyes of tradition there seemed few options for radha and sita however granted that it was not their only option what is life without desire radha questions ashok yes it's true that life provides us with a number of options but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors when your world is confined to a small indian household being a dutiful daughter in law to a silent but observant still powerful matriarch a dutiful wife of 13 years to a man who has taken a vow of celibacy due to your not being able to have a child a man who only wants you lying next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires i felt the ladies had little choice but to find solace in each other's company i guess the fact that so many women applauded ms mehta's work was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves an option to do what was perhaps unacceptable the lesbian scenes i felt was merely to put that point across every scene in the movie from the first at the taj mahal to the last at the mosque is etched in my mind how frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires to feel that you had to forgo the human touch to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you to have to suppress any desire you might have and to crave for the human touch what then is the meaning of our existence one wonders in the scene where sita is crying alone in the room and radha comes in to comfort her their lips accidentally brush against each others and it awakens a feeling in them something they have both been deprived of br br bravo to ms mehta in translating her vision so clearly i especially like the flashbacks to the young radha trying to 'see' for the ocean it is a metaphor for freedom freedom to choose freedom to transport ourselves to places we would normally be unable to reach in those scenes it is gently told to us that her sense of duty has also been passed down from her mother who i assume lives within the rich indian traditions of duty in marriage the movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by a r rahman since the film i have become ardent fans of the two lead actresses and the director i look forward to more of ms future productions
<START> this film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes whether they are wearing clothes or not the strong of its plot is upheld by the art of shakespeare as joseph papp discovered back in the 1950s in central park shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present and so the classic tales of cross dressing and other mischief found in such lighthearted comedies such as twelfth night and a midsummer night's eve and as you like it are used to good effect in this film all the young actors and actresses do a good job of advancing the plot with their blocking and dialog and costumes and the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of bend it like beckham another charming coming of age movie
<START> a film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of the english patient even down to a scene similar to when ralph fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert rock cliff in a passion in the desert the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert rock cliff but in the opposite direction calculated decision or unconscious contrast historically expanded from a very short balzac story the film is not perfect but a treat no less final shot will haunt me for weeks 8 of 10
<START> this was a television show that i watched during the 1960s as a child and was captivated by it in the many years that have passed i have often thought about this show and how good it would be to watch it again but being mindful that things of the past are not always as good as you remember them this was a great show in the 1960s and has lost nothing even now in 2007 sure there are a few odd production mistakes that you see when watching old shows and it takes a couple of episodes to get used to the dubbed voices but having done that i was as captivated now as i was back in the 1960s the samurai is played by koichi who plays the role in a very humble manner i remember during the 60s due to the popularity of the show here in australia he toured performing sword play etc and was overwhelmed by the interest in the show and in him it was great that one of my all time favourite shows still held the magic that it did during my childhood a must see series
<START> this movie was so stupid i could not bare to watch the rest of this movie to think that the spoiled bitch suggested to see other people then walks right into another relationship 5 minutes after the agreement was made i really felt sorry for the guy but then again for a guy like that to even consider letting his fiancÃ© see other people to go along with her grand idea well i'm sorry but he deserved what he got and she was definitely not the best fish in the sea either he can do way way way better she had no tits to hips no nothing and you had to have known that she wanted this right from the start 5 years how on earth did they last that long
<START> what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog cheap sets and bad acting you would have galaxina br br this film came out when the original star wars proved there was a market for science fiction this in turn lead to some gems such as alien and a revitalized star trek unfortunately it also led to some bad movies and this was obviously one of them i say obviously because i hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago i missed it when it came out in 1980 br br here's the underlying problem dorothy stratton couldn't act so for most of the movie they didn't even let her try i understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status but for the life of me i can't understand why br br clearly the movie tried to spoof star wars star trek and aliens but they clearly don't understand than when you spoof something it has to be funny this movie wasn't or at least the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny weren't science fiction is ripe for parody as spaceballs and galaxy quest proved this movie however did it poorly
