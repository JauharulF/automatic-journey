<START> sometimes but very rarely a movie tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult this movie tells several stories so well simultaneously that it was the first few times a movie i could not watch to completion it was too real and the characters so strong that watching it became a personal struggle seeing these three men and their families deal with their hardships one in particular often hit me too hard now i have watched in its entirety without interruption several times and i realize what i always suspected this movie is a masterpiece the writing the acting the blending of several stories without being even the least bit choppy everything about this movie is exceptional seven academy awards no wonder it certainly must have deserved them
<START> this film easily rivals the emotional strength the dramatic impact and the top notch performances of 12 angry men i rented it on a whim and was amazed that i had not heard of it before br br i do not know if this was emilio directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as the some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye br br the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her characters in at play in the fields of the lord she is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time br br there are some moments where i feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between estevez and his ex girlfriend almost seem written for another film estevez comes off as another character all together but those are minor complaints br br this film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences i rate it 8 out of a difficult 10 br br
<START> i saw this movie on tv and loved it i am a real disaster film fan and this one was great the cast was made of some really interesting people connie is always great and william devane is in a league of his own he can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few others can the story line is great too the thought of being able to follow a time line of what will happen and to use this time line to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea and this movie brings it out in such a way that is almost totally believable
<START> this is one of the worst films i have seen in a while br br the problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film 'artistic' or an exercise is eroticism as a result it fails on all accounts br br the acting is atrocious the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointless br br klaus kinski is probably the best thing about this film but that isn't a good thing sure he has an intense and 'unique' look but ultimately he can't actually act just look at how he reacts when his mistress leaves br br really don't watch this film some say it needs repeat viewings i say one is too many
<START> the daytime tv of films seldom have i felt so little attachment to characters seldom have i been made to cringe by such dire dialogue nauseous london thirty somethings mincing round lurid bbc sets spouting platitudinous mulch avoid this film as if it were your grandmother's
<START> another keystone comedy set in the park it seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park as so many of chaplin's and arbuckle's films are set there and while this is yet another one it is different enough and well made that i still enjoyed it br br fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting mabel normand i think she's supposed to be a little younger though in her mother's eyes she is too young to be interested in men well fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and mabel run away for some innocent fun things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen fatty finds it and gives it to mabel as a gift and many problems result br br decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film
<START> i believe i share the same psychological outlook on the world with kieslowski he is polish i am dutch yet we share a synthetic mind the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet prime minister so that as a social and cultural 'low pressure poland could play the role it did in wwii being critical yet christian towards the jews but often not less critical toward oneself there are innocence and guilt in kieslowski's world view as the symbols in catholicism the white versus the black madonna in rouge the black madonna is she who the judge fell in love with when he was a young man flashbacks are magically realistically intertwined with the present although totally coincidental such as the camera simply swinging to the other side of the street or the then young judge's red jeep passing by the now young woman's car after she accidentally hit his dog with it that we leaped through time in those same camera moves is what we grasp later his love was unanswered so that his life wasn't as he had planned it he lost his ability to love other people and animals being a judge he feels he is actually spying on other peoples' lives and when he retires he simply continues to do so spying on his neighbors this time the innocence and sense of righteousness of the younger woman literally accidentally getting into his life his better judgment and it is because of her that he spontaneously confesses his spying behavior to his neighbors and the police accepting and even holding on to the stones thrown through his windows in the process history repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves although this time he is old and the woman not the same kieslowski may have wrestled with this bit for the old judge is his alter ego and it is said he was infatuated by irÃ¨ne jacob both women play the same essential role in his psychology of the one who possesses his heart and soul and therefore can make him or break him even as an old man it is as if the 'powers in the are or god is bringing them together coincidences are too coincidental to just be chance or even good luck there has to be some mystical supernatural or theological source influencing these unfathomably deep life decisions the study book fell and opened at the page of the exam question is another example of this or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman the wind outside the opera house suddenly slams the open doors and breaks the windows the gigantic picture of the young woman happens to predict the one on tv after the drowning accident on her canal crossing trip these moments are effectively accentuated through the human voice of or what sounds like it van den
<START> a great performance by clint eastwood and particularly john malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor it's incredible eastwood is agent mike an aged and cynical secret service agent who is finishing out his career busting and chasing down routine assignments but one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious and his new partner al are sent to investigate a threat on the president by a wacko as fate would have it has stumbled not upon a delusional nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the white house as dives deeper into booth's world he attracts the bad guy's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him was jfk's top agent and present in dallas texas when he was assassinated and blames himself for what happened now he feels it's up to him to stop the current head of state from joining the list of dead presidents but this killer has turned the tables on and now he's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game who will win who will die it's a race against time to save the pres from a chameleon like enemy who can get to anyone my favorite secret service movie and as good a nail biter as any
<START> yes i watch this show because my girlfriend watches it of course well at least that's what i tell my friends but as nobody here ever known me i can say this i love it that's excellent trash tv br br first there's the panel tyra herself who doesn't miss a single opportunity to talk about herself yet she is to be taken seriously as she is quite the businesswoman then there's jay manuel a sober gay guy very serious and amazingly professional and miss jay an extroverted one queen of the catwalk and a damn funny guy and nigel self styled as the only man on the panel br br second the show is an in depth look at a shallow industry and we've got to give it to the producers for showing us the inside view which can be informative as well as entertaining br br finally the edition is great there is just the right mix of everything the girls living together in the ego house their impressions on sets the competitions themselves and the judging all of this slides smoothly with just the right beat there are no lenghts br br of course there must be other factors that led to eliminations that we don't see in the shows the panel is made up of capricious divas extroverted and quick on the bitching woe to those who offends them but that being said as long as one contestant does not step on their toes their judgment is usually fair i think br br so give your brain a break if you can't beat them join them and have a good time watching this bit of reality tv with your loved ones it will make crave for more somehow
<START> this movie is almost unknown but it is very good in a lonely danish town two old sisters live remembering a far youths when due to a strict puritan education they had to reject happiness lonely then the live in a dignified austerity until babette who flies from paris frightened by the horror of the war arrives in few time she will be able to turn the goodness and love she received when she arrived a good lottery prize lets her organize a great banquet following the best rules of french all neighbourhoods are invited all fanatically puritans they accept but they pact to not show any trace of pleasure or enjoyment as it would be a sin however the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat that they become seduced by the sensuality of french the banquet end in a very felt though quietly happiness the love between humans has awaken the miracle of rise the human kindness due to the pleasure of the sense has begun the movie is surprisingly good but it is not for all tastes during most of the movie nothing happens all is so quiet and so peaceful that during many minutes you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the town but as the movie develops it becomes more precious when babette wins the lottery prize after 30min movie the show begins the author is able with a perfect directing to show us how babette prepares the banquet how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful one love all told in a quiet delicious way with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting then as the banquet goes by the quality in showing us how the mood of all eaters changes due to the meal only with first shots with impressively filmed scenes one after another is simply astonishing in addition the tact with the colours and the photography is also superb almost every scene of the movie is like a picture so work is involved there if you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way on telling you something rather than what is told is more important this is your movie if you happen to like good meals and just love the good probably you'll feel amused as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you an oscar totally deserved the only problem is its slowness at setting up the story but i can forgive it i hope everyone too
<START> i must first mention that as a group of mates we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value hence our rental of camp blood br br camp blood was the first film which we'd rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder and was so rubbish it wans't even funny br br the dvd was returned and a refund was demanded with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stocked br br don't do what i did and let the curiosity get the better of you it's so bad it's not even funny
<START> this is by far one of the best films that india has ever made following are the plus points of the film br br wonderful direction cinematography and editing the editing is very smooth and the timing of is excellent br br even though the film shows the life of mumbai policemen and their hardships it never gets boring or sympathetic br br mind blowing acting by lead actor nana patekar one can surely hope that he gets nominated for the best actor for the academy awards br br controlled violence the violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess br br no stupid songs as in usual indian movies br br
<START> this movie could have had a lot of potential certainly with today's technology one would expect real special effects but movies are not made with special effects alone of course acting is needed this film lacked both br br first let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible why can't a movie take artistic license if you want to know about the story of moses read the bible i have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact look at of movie from its artistic br br in viewing this movie you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version it fails miserably in that heston and had presence they became their roles you don't see this here br br even if you don't compare standing on it's own this movie to too rushed parts where a scene should be developed it does not it becomes boring br br my advice skip this and watch the other as campy as the other is it's far and away the better movie
<START> absolutely i agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting fascinating and certainly beautiful film it's not necessary to see all the episodes since the first ones are the best while the last ones are a bit tiresome but for any person who likes and their good natured ways all episodes are worth seeing in typical german fashion values are constantly questioned even it's murderous nazi past is confronted in the last episodes the rich dialogues are particularly interesting these episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in germany preferably in original language br br
