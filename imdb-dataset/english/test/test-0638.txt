<START> mixing small town sheriffs high school students fake rock music and some weirdo who kills for well no reason in particular this film is essentially a re make of the giant gila monster except without the gila monster of course br br now anyone who has actually seen giant gila monster knows that it is one of the worst made films of all time frequently so slow it's not even funny and i can't believe that by 1967 giant gila monster had earned such a reputation that young directors were just dying to get to work on a sequel let alone a remake so will someone please explain to me why this film was made the dance sequence by the way is historically interesting although about three years out of date but even that's spoiled since it goes on and on and on
<START> i was sick one day and was skimming channels and i came upon this terribly rank movie the plot and even the subplots if you can find one have been done to extinction but as bad as the story was i reserve a special comment for liza minelli her character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters i have ever has the misfortune of seeing on film her only two competitors in this category are john in the pest and julia stiles in anything she's done or half done maybe she performed exactly as the script suggested or maybe groan that is the limit she has to her acting range either way they should have had a rewrite and killed her off in the first 30 seconds of the film eg like the girl that fell off the balcony in lethal weapon i but at least she had nice breasts br br most humbly submitted douglas
<START> the cast alone tells you this will be a notch above the usual italian western veteran actors robert ryan and arthur kennedy team up with alex cord who at the time seemed on the verge of stardom the result is a movie that's both off beat and down beat and yet it'll satisfy those who seek more from a western than just gunplay especially interesting here is the character played by alex cord one expects the hero in these westerns to be taciturn and introspective but clay mccord is an extreme example and surprisingly enough he's often shone in a passive even weak position much is made of the fact that he fears falling prey to the epileptic fits which his father and in these moments of helplessness he's either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him to emphasize his passivity clay mccord don't you love that name is often shone stripped to the waist as if he were little more than an attractive plaything being put on display there's even a strong masochistic streak in his nature most in evidence when he's used as a punching bag by his enemies and then suspended by his wrists and left hanging above the middle of a street not only does he often fail to protect himself but mccord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him nearly everyone who helps him is killed br br while a minute to pray a second to die is far from being a complete success it has a depth and a tone which sets it apart and causes it to linger in the memory it's also a good showcase for alex cord whose career tended to decline after this point following a few promising years in the mid 1960s he must have been about 36 years old when he filmed this in his physical prime and the scene of him hanging by his wrists bare chested and sweaty is a memorable piece of cinematic beefcake
<START> one of my favorite movies of all times have seen it three times already it does a great job of summing up the walks of life israeli humor and seriousness and much of the problems israelis go through universal theme of wanting to be accepted and be accepted for who you are good subtle humor and it's the charisma of the characters that makes this movie magic and says a lot about culture and the contradictions and humor with a great actor in it cohen i highly recommend it to anyone and it's a movie perfect for practically anyone family movie boyfriend girlfriend movie and also says apart from israeli culture wanting to be accepted most of all how important family is with all its diversity and imperfections br br great great movie
<START> ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher mirren just to prevent her action against them interesting premise could render a good movie but this one is just lame and far fetched boring with an ending embarassing just to say the least mrs mirren tries to give some dignity to this misfire but even she a good actress no doubt about it could save this garbage i give this a 4 four
<START> i cannot believe how this atrocity managed to capture the hearts and minds of a cross section of the 'bright young things' of its era but i'm certain i wish it hadn't in my opinion it is an inaccurate poorly acted weakly scripted pretentiously directed piece of the brief outings to an imagined reality bludgeon any humour to death the situations are unsubtle exaggerations which make the the already flimsy characters even more unbelievable and detestable the romance is dull the end is unsatisfying and ruins the only sensible drugs message in the film and the simple plot and i ' 'fear and is tested to extremes with the uninteresting motion of the film in short this film as a blatant visual assault with no hint of skill or initiative i condemn it to the ash heap of history and pray it stays there
<START> the action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to tie the episodes together and move the story forward the plot plods along with few exceptions e g graham greene the acting was uninspired and pedestrian at best the actors seemed to have something on their minds other than the scene they were in it is boring to observe a man driving a car through the semi desert country of this movie's setting whether he drives poorly or well such scenes are typical of the level of tension in the video so there was nothing about this video to engage or draw the observer in to make him or her care about the characters and the out comes i am doubly disappointed because i rented this movie based on the reputations of the executive producer redford and the writer of the novel on which it was based hillerman i note that the jewel box reports that funding is provided by pbs and the corporation for public broadcasting as well as carlton international i would hope that this video was as disappointing to them as it was to me and my wife to the point that they will not fund any more disasters coming from the same source
<START> this american masterpiece came as near perfection as popular art contrives to be from its beautifully equivocal and suggestive title to the magnificent performance elicited by william wyler from the nonprofessional amputee harold br br the film epitomized both the dream and the reality of the postwar this intimate engagement with the psychological facts of american life gave it an almost universal audienceÂ but unlike contemporary and preceding message pictures it was not a it showed americans as they are presented their problems as they themselves see them and provided only such temporary they themselves would the picture's values are the values of the people in itÂ br br william wyler an outstanding director triple winner of the best picture oscar adds an air of distinction to melodrama epic and westerns with his distinguishing visual style and his taste for solemn material he gained a reputation as a meticulous serious artist wyler's most adept use of deep focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content br br the film tells the story of three men coming home from war to a small middle american community and find it variously difficult to pick up where they left off the three heroes are a middle aged sergeant march magnificent as the devoted family man who succeeds in breaking the ice with his family an incisive air force captain dana andrews returning to an unfaithful wife and a tormented sailor harold russell who has lost both hands in service replaced by hooks in real life br br winner of 7 academy awards including best picture the best years of our lives is eloquent and compassionate a deeply personal motion picture with touching wordless homecoming scenes br br the first words of the sergeant's loving wife when he arrives home unexpectedly i look terrible it isn't fair of you to burst in on us like this br br the involuntarily sob of the sailor's mother when she first sees her son's mechanical hands she blurts out it's nothing br br with her dry martini voice myrna loy combines charmingly her qualities with motherly ones teresa wright is lovely as the sergeant's nice daughter who falls in love with the pilot virginia mayo is harsh as the disloyal flashy blonde wife whose first loves are money and high life and cathy o'donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the sailor's fiancÃ©e br br the situations and even some of the characters seem a little obvious but this is a superb example of high quality film making in the forties with smiles and tears cunningly spaced and a film which says what is needed on a vital subject
<START> tepid poorly produced 70's made moore because of today's headlines nonetheless this film is worthy stink fodder because of acting absent direction and silly 70's clothing sadly the moocow remembers when clothing was all the rage this has the same sort of feel to it that some better 70's sci fi moovies namely westworld and logan's run while the premise interesting rich people clone themselves to keep a ready supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever the film makes the mistake of saddling us with richard tim donnelly a clone who is at once both boring and irritating hollow acting by donnelly doesn't help but fits right in with the rest of the cast even such b as dick sargent bewitched tv series ghost with 1 000 000 eyes keenan wynn dr strangelove the dark laserblast and peter graves beginning of the end killers from space it conquered the world provide only the moost tepid performances produced directed and edited by a bunch of nobodies it's no surprise that fails to horrify anyone in the least much less keep anyone's attention truth be told there's nothing in the feeble flick that even schlock fans would love wanna see some bad funny 70's films put on anything by greydon clark is no bonus the moocow says even the mst3k version is a yawner so proceed at yer own risk 8p
<START> it hasn't even been two years since i first saw this film and yet i can barely remember a thing about this movie needless to say i found it to be very forgettable of what i do remember nothing stands out as particularly good a talented cast is wasted in what i suppose was meant to be a dark comedy but if that is the case it fails miserably at best this film is mildly interesting at worst the seemingly omnipresent overcast skies are more interesting than the storyline if you like watching films where it always seems damp and cool then i guess you may find something to like in this picture just try to ignore what else is going on because it is barely watchable
<START> i must tell you the truth the only reason i wanted to see this movie was because of rose i think that part definitely worked out pretty well actually however the film was very good too some parts of this movie are really good br br the film has great action also the mystery is pretty hard to figure out and rose does some oscar worthy acting towards the end of the film but i don't want to give anything away adam beach and jurgen prochnow are also great in the movie along with some of the other stars br br if you like mysteries or action movies or just like rose i totally think you would like this movie
<START> who is minding the store here how could any producer network executive director let a crew stick the fakest plastic palm trees in film history in the sands of a wintry canadian beach and try to fob it off on us as the tropics those trees were to real palm trees what a pink tinsel k mart christmas tree is to real and who let dermot mulroney go in front of the camera with painted on grey hair that wouldn't have passed muster in a high school play and didn't any of the geniuses doing quality control on this thing think to correct the excellent canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas everybody involved with this plodding slug of a movie writer director actors has done not just good but brilliant work elsewhere paced way too fast between events and deadly slow within them devoid of any emotion except the obvious expository and contrived maybe this only seems like one of lifetime's worst movie because of all the red carpet hype with which it was presented and i'm saying this as somebody who love lifetime what gives folks br br all of that said a certain actress's work at a certain critical turn in the movie and if you've seen it you'll know exactly what i'm talking about was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a 10 from me if that was the whole movie unfortunately it was only about five seconds of it
<START> this is not the masterpiece that is snow white cinderella or bambi but it is a very sweet enjoyable romantic well done disney animated feature br br there are of course lessons included herein for the kiddies and some very appropriate kiddie cheek but there is plenty herein for the adults as well br br while this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the classic disney romcom adventure it still holds some elements which solely belong to the aristocats is the tramp and dutchess is the lady but dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home br br phil harris is our tomcat you may recognize his voice as he also furnished the voice of baloo the bear in the jungle book and little john in disney's robin hood eva gabor lends her silky sweet voice to dutchess br br directed by wolfgang who directed or worked on every disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985 br br this is among my very favorite of the disney animated feature films and belongs in any disney collection the 2 disk special edition is due out this summer 2007 br br this rates an 8 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this is per se an above average film but why in the name of bog was it made it's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shot for shot remake of an alfred hitchcock classic of 1960 you can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness br br what does the word credit mean how can we credit van sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors slightly different sets and color br br anne heche is attractive but lacks janet leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middle class woman and heche is younger than leigh who brought to her fruitless attempt to marry and settle down the desperation of a woman facing forty and heche doesn't project anxiety the way leigh did the scene with the officer looking in her car window illustrates the weakness in the role in the original the officer asks is there something wrong leigh of course not am i acting as if something were wrong the officer hesitates before replying well frankly yes that exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that heche isn't nervous enough br br the worst change without a doubt is the substitution of vince vaughn for anthony perkins it may not be vaughn's fault who could match perkins in the role perkins is twitchy bird like long necked cloaked in an externally charming exterior that masks an inner vacuum his every move eating candy corn with his adam's apple bobbing and every utterance the faint laugh the arid chuckle is spot on he just can't be improved upon vaughn brings to the role the presence of a short haired beefy guy who was just discharged as a lance corporal from the u s army to suggest his psychosis all he can do is superimpose a maniacal giggle on top of what appears otherwise a perfectly normal norman in speech and manner unlike the original norman vaughn doesn't even stumble over the word fallacy because it resembles phallus he could be just hanging around the motel waiting to hear about his application for a football scholarship to ucla br br the direction deserves a few comments i don't see what it adds to the story when we see norman masturbating while peeping in on anne heche i don't object to it i wonder why it's there just as i wonder why the rest of the movie is there br br and i suppose in order to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience van sant seems to have missed a bit of hitchcock's more subtle stuff heche is given underwear of all different colors green pink orange and mango is that a color if so what the hell color is it never mind the point is that in the original when the traveling camera first peeks through the window of the phoenix hotel it captures janet leigh in bed wearing a pure white half slip and a white bra later after she has stolen the money we see her in her underwear again this time both her slip and bra are black tis a small thing but hitch's own br br at that the idea of shooting in color might not have been bad except that the black and white shooting of the original was superb the color and odd lighting effects in this version turn the ordinary dull and subliminally ominous motel into something that looks like it belongs in the seedier part of las vegas br br most of all the 1960 film was shocking in more ways than one i can remember seeing it in a drive in in san diego and staring aghast at the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually dead half way through the movie nothing like it had ever been done before br br that murder in the shower in both movies was a big improvement over robert original novel by the way in which the author writes something like the murderer then entered the bathroom and cut off her head with a knife i'm not making that up well not entirely even here van sant's movie gives us excess there is more blood and more bare flesh and where hitchcock closed in first on the blood circling the bathtub drain and dissolved to blankly open eye then pulled the camera back slowly to reveal her face he rotated his camera from a slight tilt to the proper vertical giving the viewer a sense of not just disbelief at the murder but a dizzying disbelief van sant doesn't tilt his camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as hitchcock did he practically twirls it on its axis br br it won't do to call this a bow to hitchcock because it's not it's a plundering of hitchcock's material already ripped off in psycho i ii iii iv and psycho the beginning years and come into my parlor mrs bates' revenge and hand me that knife would you the true story of norman bates a rehashing of and grinding away at truly original stuff a act if not a criminal one and that's not to mention the many homages in other films especially the french such as the notorious ocean of boredom scenes between marcel and jeanne in the much admired la mere de la nuit maybe i'd better add that that last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics and when a chicken's guts grind corn it's a act i won't go on except to say these gags shabby as they are are more fun than the movie br br so who was it made for i'd have to guess kids who are too young to know about the original and who don't like movies in black and white kids who are hoping to see another ordinary slasher movie chimpanzees
<START> this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character trait of the main character consequently if you are not into tragedies this is not your movie it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked dostoyevsky's 'crime and punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie prompts is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo if you are a conservative you will not like this movie br br besides other philosophical questions i must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well the hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also there was use of symbolism in representing the of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you skip it overall i give this movie a 7
