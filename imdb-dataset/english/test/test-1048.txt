<START> the net is a movie i never saw upon release i remember giving it a pass upon the mediocre reviews and since then perhaps been noticing a snippet here and there when it's been on tv seeing it now fourteen years after it's original release i'm a little flabbergasted as to how time flies being in my mid 20's it made my childhood feel ancient i felt as if i should probably do some exercise before my body starts stacking up fat in all the wrong places cut down on fat and sugar too much coffee and cigarettes br br anyway that was the best part of this movie experience for me i'd say the first 30 minutes of this movie really kept me occupied with retro heaven look at those big cans they call computers look they chat in chat rooms i remember those tank tops they look stupid and hey it even stars sandra bullock first billed would you look at that br br as a movie the net is just an unimaginative plain and totally routine cat and mouse thriller nothing archaic about that they made them then as much as they make them now bullock plays a reclusive computer nerd who's job it is to fix software for people who don't get that whole computer thingy as it happens she stumbles upon some delicate information and after her vacation trip ends up with her nearly getting killed by a sexy lay who turns out to be a killer played by jeremy northam and she should have been suspicious by the fact that they are in an american movie and the guy both smokes and has a british accent she gets her identity wiped out her house is empty for sale and upon checking it out it turns out that she now has got a new identity a convicted prostitute and impostor no less br br now you might say that this is improbable how could they possibly do that to her even in 1995 it's impossible that's true but back in '95 a lot of people didn't even know what the internet was i can see how it's a plot hole you could have accepted back then what's far more disastrous though is the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology the movie obviously owes a lot to hitchcock movies it's one of those thrillers that feature a merry go round by night but hitchcock always made sure that his movies were plausible the characters didn't act like confused maniacs when trying to prove their innocence and the plot didn't conveniently lay down for a structure where one obstacle inevitable leads to the other the characters also tried a little before giving into the whole rouge chase has bullock's character really no friends what so ever couldn't any old high school teacher confirm her identity or like her nearest pizza guy oh right she orders pizza from the internet never mind you figure the movie out pretty quickly there seems to be hope in an ex boyfriend you really think so you should always count on at least one surprise the net offers none br br the internet poses a lot of danger this movie seems to predict but had the movie been made today imagine the troubles the villains would have to go through to ensure the identity wipe not only do they have to do all those boring literal things she would still have her facebook membership with at least like 100 friends or so and picture tags not to mention she might be on youtube or linked in and what about her video blog with like 150 daily hits or the in her house and recorded video of her in other people's cell phones web downloads her imdb membership
<START> my opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases i tend to lean toward the artsy imaginative and different this movie was reminiscent of frances ford's the black stallion wherein a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent creature who's not readily available to view performing at its peak except on these multitudes of documentaries ala natural unlike those nature films this offering utilizes the finest movie making techniques the industry has to offer fit for a diva creating one of the most sensual super stars the cat on the screen br br this fantasy depicting the love relationship that develops between a french soldier he is very nice too lost on the egyptian desert and a female leopard he encounters when he chances upon an abandoned egyptian temple is mesmerizing i bought into it wholeheartedly if you are the least bit open to fantasy and appreciate the grace beauty power and sensuality of the feline you should enjoy it br br the only flaw in my book was the ending it was a perfect set up for a romeo and juliet finale that would have taken me over the top br br
<START> i had seen this movie as a kid and loved it i loved how spunky and full of energy nikki is and how she mostly ruins perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways as a kid in the 80's i saw new york exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie the domain of madonna's character with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc now as an adult i find i love the movie for the same reasons and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of ms nikki finn although i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor like in this movie pure beauty and genius
<START> the net is an excellent movie it's about angela bennett in a great performance of sandra bullock who is a computer expert who works for the cathedral company cleaning virus and testing games for the clients angela is a typical nerd who doesn't have friends outside of the cyberspace almost doesn't take vacations and go out and stays almost all the time connected one day her friend dale hessman ray asks her to help him sending angela a disk with a strange program that has many confidential informations at the same night when dale was going to meet her he is suddenly killed in a plane crash going to mexico in her vacation angela meets a beautiful guy called jack devlin jeremy northam who shows to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the secret of the br br her life then turns into a nightmare all her records are erased and she is given the new identity of ruth marx a woman with serious problems with the police br br this movie is great because it shows how we humans depend a lot of the computers and machines sometimes more that we should and how vulnerable we are if someday someone decides to control and change our personal records without letting us the chance to prove the error
<START> this could have been a breakout role for valeria golino but the film instead decided to shift its attention to another area the film is about a woman named grazia golino who is married to a fisherman and the mother of three she is a free spirit and prone to outbursts so the rest of the village and her family decide she should be sent to milan and see a doctor the story takes place on the island of off of sicily and it shows the everyday life there with the teenage boys in rivaling gangs and just trying to find something to do on the sun baked rock oldest son francesco adores her and is always trying to protect her during her bouts of depression the daughter veronica is a blossoming young girl who becomes infatuated with a local policeman and the youngest son is very sassy and mocks the policeman's accent upon learning that she is to be sent to milan grazia runs away and helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone searches for her this film could have really made more of an impact if it could have concentrated its focus to grazia we do see some outbursts and irrational behavior on her part but their is no follow up to these scenes nothing comes of it the film looks great and is beautifully photographed so give director emanuele credit for that but the story needed to focus on something more substantial the film does a good job of showing us what life is like on this island and what is going on in the lives of the three children as they grow up their is some speculation that character gives a hint of being a mermaid like creature and that is why she is having difficulty existing on land i also sense that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain manner and if you don't then you can be subjected to the harsh realities of its rules all speculations but i do think the films attention could have stayed with the character of grazia after she hides in the cave she really has nothing to do in a sense the character becomes stagnant i wish golino had more to do because i've always liked her and whenever she is onscreen you just can't take your eyes off her she's a bundle of fury passion and raw energy what a shame didn't write a more complete role for her to act in when the film ends your left feeling empty from an incomplete story
<START> my mother frank begins as a warm amiable comedy about a middle aged catholic woman frank short for francis played by cusack who shakes herself out of the doldrums by as a student in her son's university most of her friends and family are horrified not least her son matthew newton who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend rose byrne meanwhile frank has raised the ire of her disapproving english tutor sam neill br br matthew newton is utterly disarming as david relaxed and natural in the role even when the character's uptight he generates valuable goodwill steering the audience through some of the film's more awkward broad comedy moments not long after the half way point first time writer director mark expertly steers his film into darker emotional territory and gives cusack a real chance to shine br br the supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces sacha nicholas bishop and all the principals including a more animated than usual sam neill are excellent while it meanders a little towards the end my mother frank delivers more than it promises and is a genuine australian crowd pleaser
<START> where the heck is andreas exactly heaven hell a parallel universe when the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an train his next conscious moment occurs on a bus riding solo the newest arrival in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere andreas is greeted by an official man who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city if the eyeballs work is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited if memory serves him right andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance a man estranged from people and objects struggling to find his bearings at home or rather his assigned apartment or at work where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor johannes his boss tells him you'll get used to it which covers more than just crunching numbers we suspect in this world same as the old world br br if life is meaningless like french existentialist philosopher jean paul said the same can be said for death as well the subculture of office life might be heaven for one man but it looks like hell to us under the context that den operates on to work in the afterlife in essence is to work for the rest of your life the social intercourse among office mates may pass as normal in the physical world but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer as he she now recognizes the drudgery of white collar labor performed by white collar laborers who kill the hours with their inconsequential small talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like each and every day seem irrational in its self evident absurdity to see daily life replicated in a speculative light den makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy as quotidian life becomes a performance which transforms karl marx's meaning of the word alienation because here the men and women in the office do identify with their labor like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real but the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade he's always aware of the cracks br br from a wooden bench andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger with the hope that he'll feel the pain on a paper he doesn't it's just another sensation in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man this inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures amplifies the bothersome man's need for love where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world at a dinner party hosted by his boss andreas meets anne britt barker they hit it off he walks her home she invites him in they become a couple he moves in when they have sex however it's good for neither andreas nor anne who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design love is an abstract concept another sensation that's unattainable in this world but love matters to the bothersome man so he tries again with a girl from work den deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman when doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for andreas after his hyper romantic gesture of leaving anne britt for her this norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic but odd city with an open that's and offer up multiple interpretations br br wounded by apathy towards his of love for her the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station stands at the same platform leers at the same couple aggressively making out and jumps this time he can't die how can you die when you're already dead hit repeatedly by train after train face turns into ground beef his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art when the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp he seeks out the man from the club who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead which is death not life has no meaning br br getting to the bottom of the mystery behind whereabouts drives the narrative and to the filmmaker's credit this enigma is satisfactorily addressed in a scene that recalls spike being john malkovich when andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world like a newborn baby which resembles the portal to brain that craig schwartz charges people to crawl through attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the belief that heaven is a place on earth but at the same time heaven is proved by the reality of a hell the place that andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination
<START> los angeles 1976 indie film brat john carpenter fresh out of film school and with one film his class no budget spoof of 2001 called dark star under his belt finishes a gritty actioner called assault on precinct 13 the story of an almost deserted police station under siege by an unseen la gang it was a minor hit on the drive in circuit and garnered small praise from the few critics who cared but it hardly set the film world on fire unlike carpenter's follow up smash halloween 1978 on precinct carpenter was still learning how to exploit his almost non existent budget by using lower shelf actors keeping the action to the one hellishly small location and moving the film along at a tight pace with a combination of editing intelligent camera work and switched on genre savvy br br no one wants or needs to be hungry in hollywood anymore particularly if the week's catering bill on the 2005 version of assault on precinct 13 is more than the entire cost of the original it does translate into a certain kind of laziness on a filmmaker's part you have a stupidly large union crew a studio and a marketing firm all doing your thinking for you which is why twenty years after watching carpenter's film i can still see every glorious moment from the small girl gunned down in cold blood while buying an ice cream to the relentless pounding synth score a week after assault 2005 i remember larry fishburne's unmoving ping pong ball eyes and little else br br forgettable popcorn actioner fits the top of the poster perfectly it's new years eve at precinct 13 a station closing down with a skeleton staff to see in its final hours on call is jake ethan hawke an ex narc now deeply troubled and hopped up on jack daniels and after his partners were iced in the opening scene iris the sopranos' drea de matteo a nympho with a thing for criminal types and jasper brian dennehy a crusty old timer one scotch away from retirement as in carpenter's assault a bus with four heavy duty criminals is to the precinct all boozy eyes are on gangster kingpin bishop fishburne still beefed up from his time in the matrix who has narrowly survived an assassination attempt from an undercover cop and plans to blow the lid on the endemic corruption in the organized crime unit led by marcus duvall a tired looking gabriel byrne soon the phones are out the power lines are down and both crims and police find themselves heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia while waging war against a task force of duvall's corrupt cops sporting white bullet vests infra red bazookas and more high tech gear than the skywalker ranch this we're expected to believe as the helicopters buzz around the top of the police station shooting rockets into windows is a clandestine operation to cover duvall's tracks he may as well have taken out billboards on hollywood boulevard br br as with the recent seventies genre reworking dawn of the dead assault 2005 takes the barest plot essentials of john carpenter's original and to quote the seventies does it's own thing man the main question is why bother john carpenter's 1976 is a cult favorite among genre buffs but is hardly branded in the public's collective consciousness carpenter himself was busy reworking howard hawks' classic western rio bravo into a tight claustrophobic urban thriller for only 20 000 french wunderkind director and rap producer jean francois a self professed fan of john carpenter's work seems less concerned with making an homage to either hawks or jc although the script is peppered with references to cowboys and injuns and seems intent on squeezing in as much flash and firepower as the multi million dollar budget can withstand the result some tense moments with hand held pov cameras an unexpectedly high and bloody body count a few neat plot twists but essentially a b grade urban actioner with a much inflated price tag as for name checking carpenter it's pure conceit on the part of the filmmakers that doesn't pay off br br to monsieur i say bon voyage and i wish you luck on your music career
<START> dear readers br br i've found in my studies of movies that whenever michael bay makes a movie people pan it and hate it yet they still go to see it and it makes somewhere around 100 million dollars why because michael bay is one of the top five directors of all time standing alongside ridley scott spielberg kubrick and miyazaki michael bay has cemented himself as hollywood's best action adventure director that point is proved with his most panned film armageddon br br an asteroid the size of texas is hurtling towards the planet and the only way nasa can think to take it down is to land a team of men on the asteroid drill to its core and drop a nuclear warhead inside then blow up the asteroid only one person is qualified enough to do it bruce willis willis portrays harry stamper a grizzled hardened oil driller trying to keep what's left of his family together not helping that fact is his daughter grace liv tyler having an affair with his best driller aj ben affleck hired by dan truman billy bob thornton the head of nasa stamper and his team of roughneck drillers train to become astronauts and save the world br br armageddon is a two part movie first there's the funny parts where we meet the gang and wackiness abounds then they get into space and all the comedy gets sucked out the window and is replaced by mind blowing special effects cool music and great serious acting murphy's law goes insane in the second part meaning that everything that can go wrong does in fact go wrong increasing the tension of the film to outstanding levels br br with a cool cast and crew michael bay as director jerry bruckheimer and gale anne hurd as producers and j j abrams as one of the scriptwriters tons of special effects great humor awesome music plus an intro done by mr ben hur himself charlton heston armageddon rocks big time br br signed the constant dvd collector matt macleod br br parental warnings this is not a film for kids the f bomb is used a few times and lots of other swear words are used as well plus there's a strip bar scene and the extremely intense second part might be too hard for a kid to handle
<START> ray charles robinson jamie foxx is a extremely talented pianist and singer as well ray is an smart man as well ray started his career in the late 1940's before he finds his distinctive style ray is certainly popular at the night clubs with his music things changes when he meets an ambitious music producer curtis armstrong who knows ray got what it takes to be an strong performer and he also meets an woman kerry washington he loves as well marries along the way ray's album becomes an hit when he mixes soul music and gospel together which makes ray an controversial man during in the 1950's to the 1960's ray has love for all kind of music including country but ray isn't always the perfect man as he seems to be since he had plenty of failed relationship with other woman while he's married but he also had to battle with racism people who double crossed him his music ideals and of course his drug addiction which it made ray's life extremely difficult for him and as well for battling the tragedy of his childhood which ray always blamed himself for br br directed by oscar winner taylor against all odds devil's advocate dolores claiborne made an fascinating true life story of the always interesting of the late ray charles foxx won an oscar for his touching performance of the late entertainer foxx brings heart and soul in the film and humour as well but this film has plenty of rich performances by an top cast including regina king clifton powell ellis warwick davis terrence howard and sharon warren as ray's mother this is probably the best film of career to date the film has plenty of song of charles's best music as well br br dvd has an sharp pan scan 1 33 1 transfer and an excellent dolby digital 5 1 surround sound disc 1 has an informative commentary by the director and the dvd also has the original theatrical cut and extended version as well but u are better watching the theatrical version instead because the bonus footage is in bad shape at times and u have to click on a logo if you want to see these deleted scenes disc 2 has deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director which is seen in the extended version featurettes and more but the featurettes are disappointingly short for this dvd since the movie is extraordinary good this film was nominated four oscars including best costume designs best director best editing and best picture this is an amazing true life story well told but of course charles' life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final film still it's pretty damn close screenplay by james l white from an story by white and director oscar winner for best sound don't miss it Â½
<START> you know the saying curiosity killed the cat well i have heard so much about this film from a magazine that named this one of the most shocking movies of all time my 1001 movies you must see before you die my sister who saw this at a film festival and the i love the 70's show on vh1 i just had to see this movie since it was named the grossest movie of all time and well after viewing this film last night i have to say that it really did live up to it's title my god this movie was so weird i thought i really did see it all with some of the sickest movies and tv shows i've seen some things i guess will always still feel like a shock br br well babs johnson aka divine has been named the filthiest person alive and a jealous couple named the marbles are competing for that title they want to take divine out and be named the filthiest couple alive by kidnapping women raping them impregnating them and selling their babies to lesbian couples but it seems like divine and her family of well i don't know seems to keep the title by having sex with chickens butt lip syncing eating dog feces stuffing meat up their skirts incest and it just gets grosser and grosser br br pink flamingos is horribly acted horribly made and well just plain horrible the reason for the 10 rating i'm going to give it is due to the fact well how could you rate this film i always rate so i just figure what the heck through the grossness of this film you have got to give john waters some credit who the heck would ever think of this movie over 35 years later to the cast and crew who worked on this film you guys are just plain nasty br br 10 10
<START> count ralph fiennes has just been transferred to a hospital in italy during world war ii he is horrifically burned from an ambush his nurse hana juliette binoche tends to him body and mind for she fears quite rightly that he may be a very troubled soul in the course of his care the count starts to tell hana of his recent past it seems he worked in a government capacity in africa where he met a beautiful married lady named katherine kristin scott thomas although they tried to avoid each other they fell in love after a brief affair katherine called it quits leaving the count desolate even so the two would meet again under heart wrenching circumstances meanwhile hana herself falls for a man in the british bomb squad yet the war is raging relentlessly can love exist when the world is in turmoil this is a tremendous film based on an equally fine but complex novel the plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully each of them poignant beyond description the script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines fiennes is magnificent both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth scott thomas is also quite fine as the woman who fights against her passions as for binoche she richly deserved the oscar that she was presented as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation the scenery is utterly gorgeous as are the costumes the direction and the production if you have missed out on viewing this film rectify that soon very soon the english patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in film for centuries to come
<START> a man named jerry comes into possession of an ancient aztec doll however this creepy little figure is possessed by an evil spirit which takes over jerry's body and pushes him to spill the blood i have seen two other horror movies the dorm that dripped blood and the kindred made by stephen carpenter and jeffrey obrow and i must say that the power doesn't disappoint either the plot is slow moving but there are some effective human goo effects and a little bit of gore the scene of a female tabloid reporter being attacked by arms that come ripping out of a mattress is a hoot i liked this low budget horror movie and you should too if you are into 80's horror genre 8 out of 10
<START> so pathetic its not even funny from the first scene in the movie i knew i was in for a bad time thank goodness i only saw this movie on tv the story line was terrible not to mention the acting it was horrid very unreal and unusual things happened in this move such as the lady sticks a whip under the door and whips the guy a little and he just hands over the keys i'm like get real the creators lousy attempt to make a futuristic city even deepened my dislike for the film to tell you the truth the only good thing in this movie at all was the fighting which was in itself pretty lame all i could ask myself when watching this movie was when is it gonna go off
<START> this dvd is missing its calling as a coaster this is a great example of why no one should ever go see a sequel with a different director writer than the original two hours of this turkey left me begging for exorcist 2 reruns br br no legitimate laughs not one decent scare the script was just a mess and i felt bad for the actors who had to perform it they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke habits or something br br the original was a makeup effects landmark so naturally the producers of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to to scrap makeup fx and do cg werewolves instead these cg werewolves had me laughing a lot harder than any of the comedy it was just a total miss if ya want a night's entertainment go rent the original again or go take a film class and make your own horror film you're bound to do better than these fools did
