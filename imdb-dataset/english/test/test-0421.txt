<START> this is not a good film by an standards it is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par some performances are well below par but swayze and grey do a very good job with little to work with br br what was good br br the dance sequences were choreographed very well and as stated above swayze and grey were high points br br what was bad br br the script the bad guys were simply too evil to be believable the best villains are the ones who aren't so obviously evil these guys the owner's nephew the waiter who impregnates the girl do and say nothing that would leave me to believe they could be real people perhaps there are guys like them but i sure don't want to see a movie about it br br another scene the first where grey and swayze meet when the employees at the resort are dancing swayze and grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves the next time they meet swayze is hostile towards her why what happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well together br br and some of those lines i mean come on i cringed at the end when swayze muttered the line nobody puts baby in the corner how did he ever do that with a straight face br br another thing wrong the setting of the 1960's everyone looked and dressed like the 1980's who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles br br the music original music for the film was laughable with the exception of i had the time of my life which was a good song br br not the worst film i've ever seen but definitely the most over rated
<START> i can laugh at just about anything but unfortunately there is not a single one to be found in this stink bomb i honestly watched this movie from beginning to end and did not even crack a smile i am shocked that sandler schneider spade etc would put their names on this piece of crap worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst that ever came out of former snl players what more can i say how could such tasteless extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent maybe i have lost my sense of humor not likely but i cannot remember a movie that i have disliked this much in a long time what a waste of 2 hours i will never get back
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies i've ever seen the beginning was not the greatest either but better than this one this is not a good way to lead up to the original movie it's just simply awful the cgi hyenas were so fake looking in both movies why not use real animals i enjoyed the old sinbad movies better than this i was royally disappointed the only good thing i can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well i understand why this movie was redone as the beginning it's just that bad in my opinion where does the money come from to waste like this give me a multi million dollar budget and i'll show you how it should be done
<START> the feeling of the need to have someone play the role of arbiter of public taste and political correctness always manages to get under our skin it does seem that these self appointed self superior pseudo intellectual types do appear everywhere be it in one's family church or bowling league br br these are the guys who would have society completely disregard and ignore all that went before us unless of course whatever 'it' is does not fly in the face of today's acceptable language mores and general standards of proper behavior br br so it is that these latter day high tech book burners have targeted a great deal of what was hollywood's greatest achievement namely their participation in our own allied propaganda via their unselfishly crafted message and theme films br br coldly brutal in its generation the banned code and list of now unacceptable extends into the wartime cartoons that don't meet with the new touchy feely socially engineered 'official' attitudes which these thought police have foisted down upon us br br we were truly surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of such animated short subjects the majority we are aware of are from warner brothers' looney tunes and merrie melodies featuring bugs daffy elmer porky all in conflict with hitler tojo and the like surprisingly though we found an ample supply of cartoons from mgm walt disney paramount famous studios and the brothers fleischer br br you're a sap mr jap famous studios paramount pictures 1942 is a prime example of just what we're talking about br br being virtually indiscernible from the cartoons that were the output of the studios of max and dave fleischer before the 1941 business coup de tat that moved them out bringing the new name of famous studios you're a sap mr jap bore none of the bland plot elements that would reduce the latter day popeye cartoons down to the level of the ultimate formula short movie br br we all remember how we'd have popeye and olive oyl together enter bluto usually the exponent of wolf whistle and an on acceptable on screen version of a male reaction to feminine olive falls for bluto's less than honorable attentions until he gets a little too physical and invariably blurts out hey babe how 'bout a kiss at this point we hear help help popeye and the diminutive sailor shows up to save the day replete with the obligatory can of spinach do we exaggerate schultz once again this jap sap cartoon is nothing like any of that oh sure it follows the storyline of now having popeye in the u s navy the brothers fleischer put the little guy in the service in 1941 to conform to the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men now being conscripted in the first peacetime draft in united states history max and dave even put popeye in service aboard the mythical battleship the u s s br br our point is just this you're a sap mr jap and others like spinach fer britain aren't cartoon vehicles for comic relief in the theatre's program at all in the true sense rather they are a sort of grouping of editorial cartoons much like those from any great metropolitan newspaper these animated shorts much like those still one panel illustrations have characters that are highly symbolic and representative of nations ideas and ideals such as a just and lasting peace in most cases the hero popeye bugs bunny or whoever is alone with the symbol of the enemy both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thought even if they are cloaked in humorous trappings for wider br br our liberal the antithesis of may not see themselves this way but for this sort of behavior they are no more than neo nazi book burners br br please allow the future generations to view and appreciate a view of past happenings that is both historical and humorous br br poodle schnitz
<START> a brash self centered army cadet arrives at west point with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the corps br br in a role obviously tailor made for him william haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor friendship a grade a scene stealer haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual silly billy behavior which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the the last half however becomes very serious leading up to haines' moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents if west point does not quite reach the caliber of haines' previous tell it to the marines 1926 this is doubtless due to the absence here of a costar of the charisma quality of lon chaney for haines to interact with however this tribute to the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated on its own merit br br joan crawford appears as haines' love interest playing the virginal daughter of the local innkeeper joan is pert pretty and especially shines in her first scenes when she meets haines on a hudson river ferry and is subjected to his usual immature antics haines crawford made five silent feature films together and were tremendous friends for life he was the much bigger celebrity at this period and gave her many hints for getting ahead in hollywood a superstar herself by the early 1930's she reciprocated after his from mgm in 1932 by encouraging his career change to interior decoration br br little william bakewell is effectively cast as a who idolizes haines their relationship is actually given more of a sentimental treatment than that of haines crawford br br the film was made with the full cooperation of the war department extensive location filming at the academy helps tremendously with the production's ambiance which was given splendid production values by mgm br br west point has been recently restored and given a rousing new score by david davidson
<START> i'm glad i didn't pay to see 'the boy' br br i sat there hopefully waiting for something original and or funny to happen br br it reminded me very much of those predictable english comedies of the 1970s br br i won't bother with a synopsis of the plot i suggest you do something else for 90 minutes br br
<START> i admire deepa mehta and this movie is a masterpiece i'd recommend to buy this movie on dvd because it's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once and trust me you'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times br br the characters except for the grandmother perhaps are all very balanced no black and white even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists there is also empathy for the other characters br br i think the imdb rating for the movie is far too low probably due to its politically controversial content
<START> i watched primarily for the presence of michael dorn as i enjoyed his worf portrayal on star trek tng but had never seen him out of his makeup dorn appears to have a nice presence and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career this movie however gave him little dramatic challenge except to prove that he can indeed use the f word br br it appears that this movie was made by someone who fancied himself as a forward thinking type with a social conscience yeah for 1965 today the themes are so belabored and sophomoric and cornball that even spike lee's dreadful bamboozled looks good in comparison br br this crime caper flick has an intricate labrynth of double triple and quadruple crosses but the plot scheme is so convoluted that it collapses upon itself within the first 30 minutes mostly after that point i simply watched out of momentum and a mild curiosity about how each scene would play out there is a great cast here you will recognize virtually everyone as a character actor from much better movies why are they all in this i suspect it was 1 the work and some money even if modest 2 perhaps the director knows all these actors from acting classes and social connections around la you know perhaps they participated to support him as a fellow struggling movie guy on the third and fourth of the hollywood scene dunno but the movie was half baked not really finished i gave it a 3 although my affection for the actors involved was from my admiration of their previous work let's hope everybody has moved on to more professional more carefully done and more thorough projects since
<START> let me start out by saying i love horror movies big budget low budget big name actors no name actors it doesn't matter and when it comes to judging movies i am very forgiving this movie however is pretty bad br br the actors show little or no emotion when delivering their lines and the acting is worse than many lower budget horror flicks i've seen as the actors get killed off you could care less there is very little gore i have no idea what film other reviewers watched when they say there is good gore in this one because there isn't and the special effects are substandard at best they steal so much from so many better horror movies jeepers creepers friday the 13th leprachaun and it still doesn't help br br luckily i saw this on showtime and didn't have to actually pay any extra money to see it or waste a spot in my netflix queue on it there are so many better horror movies out there and i recommend you see those instead of this big letdown
<START> it amazes me that production companies will sue because of they will not supply i've been looking for this movie on dvd for a while and vhs for years one can get all sorts of movies on line old movies new movies but it all targets a particular group this movie is very nostalgic for many i'm not sure why i can't get a copy maybe if enough people will write in the copyright holder will get a clue it's about time for this to happen yes it's date but so is the wizard of oz it doesn't seem like this should be so difficult so for now i'll keep seeing those illegal copies on search engines like many others
<START> i was really disappointed with this movie i had heard some great reviews about it and unfortunately missed seeing it in theaters as a result of this i was really excited to see it when it came to dvd i thought that it was going to be a high paced horror movie with a lot of scary surprises but instead it was a snail paced predictable movie it dragged and dragged without a climax in it and after all the difficulties that those people went through to try and escape the ending was completely frustrating i gave this movie two stars for one reason this is not your typical horror movie with one central bad guy slashing a bunch of people to death the story makes this movie unique and provides a change for people who watch a lot of horror movies even though i don't like this movie i recommend that all horror fans do see it at least once you may surprisingly like it as for this horror fan all i can say is that i hope there isn't a sequel to this forgettable movie
<START> what is night vision well according to the star williamson let's see one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark to which he replies 'it makes for better 'night vision ' what in the hell does that mean in fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say it has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through not to mention a cop on duty drinking robert forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze and a killer who videos his murders that's actually all i remember br br the film took place in texas had a few car chases and a clichÃ©d ending perhaps if one watches this film with their eyes closed it might be good after all without being able to see it it would make for better night vision did that make sense nope and neither does this film
<START> what can i say about kramer vs kramer on the surface it's rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself it delivers many fantastic moments it makes you laugh it makes you cry you sympathize with the characters and you care about them many films fail at this kramer vs kramer is a success br br i think everyone would agree the acting is superb once you watch kramer vs kramer for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional the actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen there's some beautiful chemistry between them i think the best performance in the film comes from the young justin henry he's different from any other child actor i've ever seen he's amazingly natural br br also there's some kind of neurotic beauty in meryl streep and dustin hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career the story is very well written it's simple but complicated at the same time the concept is the simple part the feelings associated is the complicated part of it br br if you haven't seen this film yet you're definitely missing out see it now
<START> jack and kate meet the physician daniel first and then the psychics miles and they demonstrate that have not come to the island with the intention of rescuing the survivors locke and his group find the anthropologist charlotte staples lewis and ben linus shoots her meanwhile the group of jack finds the pilot frank who landed the helicopter with minor damages that can be repaired jack forces miles to tell the real intention why they have come to the island br br the second episode of the fourth season returns to the island with four new characters stops the confusing flash forwards and it seems that will finally be the beginning of the explanations that i and most of the fans and viewers expect to be provided in lost why the interest of the government in ben linus and how he is informed from the boat are some of the questions that i expect to see in the next episodes my vote is eight br br title brazil not available
<START> centres on czech ww2 pilots Â the older frantisek the boyish impulsive karel and in the background the quiet piano playing as the film opens it is 1950 the war is over and frantisek and are imprisoned in a former monastery in their now soviet controlled native country they are of the people' is severely by his communist countrymen and dies br br in 1939 many pilots manage to escape german occupied europe and make their way to england where they join the raf notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face raf reluctance and british stiff upper lip finally they fight in the battle of britain however frantisek and karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman br br in terms of romantic sub plot this is very similar to the hollywood production pearl harbour however given the context of the film and eventual fate it is also possible to read the english woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of british treatment of the czech and polish raf pilots conveniently forgetting them once the war is over br br in addition the film is a lot less clichÃ© than pearl harbour and the characters are more fully realised dark blue world also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models actual live action aerial filming and out takes from the 1969 epic the battle of britain br br in short dark blue world is a well made moving thought provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of pearl harbour to shame highly recommended
