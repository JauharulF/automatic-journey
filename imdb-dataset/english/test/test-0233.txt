<START> i would just like to point out in addition to pleading for the series to be released on dvd that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining these days with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas reality shows etc it's nice to get lost in a good cheesy show with entertaining characters fits the bill was it emmy material no but it was awesome just the same br br i also have to put a vote in for the second cast they were more charismatic than the cast of season one i would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the second two but i was definitely more sucked in by the latter cast even though the series has been off the air for years i'll never stop hoping that it be released for purchase
<START> on the pure theatrical side last stand was great as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that while not as long or as flashy are far more historically comprehensive br br certain little details such as the misuse of the word for the greek hoplite shield and the of various names and words really ate at me br br my guess would be that because last stand of the 300 was aired the eve of the theatrical release of 300 the history channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movie's hype br br if you're looking for a depiction that's historically accurate in all respects possible you'd have better luck elsewhere
<START> i thought that the storyline came into place very well i liked this movie a lot if you're going to rag on a bridget fonda movie you can just rot i thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea apparently somebody doesn't think so i rather enjoyed the movie i'm even thinking of buying it i want it to be my very first dvd for my room that's how much i like it i rather would not start an online argument with someone i don't know have it be over a movie if someone could kindly retract what they said about the storyline i would be more than happy to retract my insult however if they feel that i am not worthy of a i might just feel that they are not worthy of one either but i can't control their actions i can only encourage them in the right direction hey they don't have to make a but i would greatly appreciate it
<START> anyone who has ever gone on an audition can certainly relate to this one great story of an aspiring actor and the pressures he must deal with both personally and professionally in order to make it to the big time lou myers as half step wilson provides many hilarious moments
<START> this show is non stop hilarity the first joke will make u wet your pants and thats probably the weakest joke of them all i started watching it when the second half of season 2 started airing and straight away i'm hooked only 2 weeks after i started watching i've downloaded episodes and bought the dvd's reoccurring clips such as the ad road test and current affairs are quiet hilarious then there's the they take off use emo use your own tears for more effective use also funny in the politics side of things nothing is wrong with them doing this it's funny any australians who don't find this funny don't complain and don't watch it all australian tune in wednesday at 9 on abc
<START> franco zeffirelli's the taming of the shrew romeo and juliet jesus of nazareth othello third stab at transferring shakespeare to the screen works very well with the casting of mel gibson mad max lethal weapon and pre the passion of the christ notoriety in the role formerly owned by sir laurence olivier and rightly so see my review on his hamlet arguably the best interpretation of one of the bard's timeless and most quoted tragedies and redone 5 years later by kenneth branagh as a full bloodied treatment explaining its 3 hour 22 minute running time combined with a dream cast and a lot of little additions which were well chosen and expertly done by the contemporary master of william shakespeare kenneth branagh the director of henry v and dead again joining the lethal weapon star are glenn close the big chill paul scofield a man for all seasons alan bates ian holm michael maloney who would be cast as roderigo opposite kenneth branagh and laurence fishburne in oliver parker's othello see my review of olivier's stage version of the tragedy though he only starred in it and who branagh would cast as laertes in his 3 hour version of hamlet a proper homage to sir laurence olivier and his classic version of the play see my review on that one as well 5 years later nathaniel parker who would be cast as cassio in his brother's version of othello 4 years later and helena bonham carter who would be cast in mary shelley's frankenstein 4 years later br br zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to sir laurence olivier who had died 2 years prior to this movie and it works pretty well for the most part what i was slightly uncomfortable with was zeffirelli's a lot of lines and in one scene he gives one of hamlet's lines to the ghost also helena bonham carter did not convince me as ophelia she was too dull and unreal whereas jean simmons who had immortalized the role in olivier's version and kate winslet who did an acceptable job in kenneth branagh's uncut epic revisionist reworking of hamlet were good in the role with jean simmons being the best ophelia ever that's why she was nominated for best actress in 1948 she didn't win what a shame ian holm said his lines too quickly not slowly as i expected him to in a scene with him laertes and ophelia but then again i'm more used to felix aylmer and richard briers' interpretations of the role and i think that they did better jobs than holm in their respective versions of hamlet both done by great directors actors text editors producers and stars of all their versions of the bard's work as polonius br br the rest of the cast however was excellent the scene where hamlet confronts his mother was very well done but olivier and branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required br br i recommend this version just to pass the time but it's ideal as a teaching tool for 12th grade english teachers i recommend showing olivier's version first then branagh's and finally this version despite the film's pg rating there was really nothing objectionable in the movie only what the play called for br br the best versions of hamlet are br br 1 sir laurence olivier and kenneth branagh both were so good that i can't decide which one was the best see my reviews on these versions for more information br br 2 franco zeffirelli this one was alright it started out alright with a scene not in the play but should've then progressed to the actual beginning of the play where a guard cries out who's there nay answer me stand and unfold yourself that scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting quietly and then bam you almost jump out of your skin in short that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play huge blunder on zeffirelli's part to omit that scene it also misplaced a lot of lines and cut others that i think should've been put in such as the line where hamlet says to ophelia get thee to a nunnery why thou be a breeder of sinners that line was supposed to have occurred in that scene not where it was placed in the film after the to be or not to be soliloquy this version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature kenneth branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy making his version a more fitting homage to sir laurence olivier as several of the actors aside from him had performed hamlet on stage or on film many times on different occasions however zeffirelli's take on hamlet is faithful to the play and that's what i was looking for the setup for the final act duel was the same as in olivier and branagh's versions only that the denouement in branagh's version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions more in line with the play olivier toned it down and it worked equally well and stuck more closely to the play with branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own to very good effect br br this version is not rated
<START> when precious bane aired in america i was stunned by this beautiful story all the actors were brilliant clive owen really understood the character he played i went right away to a bookstore and ordered the original novel which is even more beautiful and which went out of print just after i bought the book although i've seen it online a few times now i had also hoped with the oscar won by janet mcteer and the huge popularity of clive owen the bbc would naturally get this fine production on dvd i cannot believe all these years later we still have no dvd it has to be the only production ever created by the bbc that is not for sale come on bbc you have money to make off us fans here get this on dvd please
<START> this film is bad yes but had the producers used a real kangaroo it would have killed the actor it was boxing with i am an australian and i have seen two seven foot tall male fighting each other it is not a pretty sight as the object is for one or the other to kill it's opponent this is there way of securing the herd of females and there are incidents where someone has boxed a kangaroo and been injured or killed so when you see a kangaroo on tv or film it is likely to be a female or animated as it is a good idea not to injure actors they might be annoyed at losing the ability to breath there is a strange idea that australian animals are cute and cuddly that is false many are dangerous 10 of the 12 most deadliest snakes live here and most are just plain ugly are as soft as steal wool so if you come to australia be carefull
<START> well i'd probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie cos honestly i thought it was such a piece of crap i mean the actors had done a terrible acting job and the script was all terrible although the special effects wasn't a bit bad but i think the should have thought a lot harder than that i mean how did clara bryant get successfully put into this film i mean she'd do a lot better if she looked a bit further and that goes the same with kristen honey i mean her character dies and she doesn't bother to try and defend herself i mean it's gotta be a total joke she should at least do a lot better than what she an do like become a soldier or more of a heroine or something along the lines of bravery but the point is the actors did a complete soulless lousy job and so did the director and the writer who made this film they should've went into film school to think up some better ideas and i hope everyone agrees with my methods cos they are probably thinking the same thing
<START> oh my goodness i would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than domestic disturbance this soon but here it is armed with rotten plot terrible editing stilted acting and headache inducing 'style' sorry i have no other words for it is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re evaluate an entire genre that is this film is so bad that even the thrillers i condemned as complete failures now seem a little better br br now not only is a terrible film in itself it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it right from the main titles nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from se7en i was under the impression that something didn't smell quite right as soon as the movie started with a series of corny wanna be hip quick cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors i knew where that smell was coming from br br it turns out that two policemen or rather policeman jim michael parÃ© and policewoman dorothy smith jennifer rubin are investigating on a murder spree in vancouver a serial killer known as monkey killer what a menacing chilling nickname uh for his working methods has killed quite a lot of people you see this nut apparently works following the proverb see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and cuts eyes ears and tongues out of his victims so far six eyes six ears and three tongues in very ingenious fashion and smith figure out that the monkey killer is probably going to kill other three people well because he probably wants to complete the number 666 so suddenly the film focuses on tom casper van dien a young successful good looking businessman with a dreadful temper and that's where the rip off of american psycho kicks in br br so we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath none of which is interesting in the least until they finally meet along the way to that a disco where barely misses unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory goes in the back of the disco club because well just because the script tells us it's a suspect place then with one single punch in the stomach renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path and the guard is never heard of again does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic br br anyway after another murder turns in as a witness but smith and especially immediately suspect he might be the killer in typical basic instinct fashion smith gets some dates with the young businessman under the assumption that she might discover his true identity br br i won't spoil the ending but it is quite simply an embarrassment there are contradictions some plot holes issues that never get resolved and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder supposed to be shocking and sad comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that i frankly can't imagine how anyone could not laugh at it br br at 87 minutes is really pushing it you never care about one single character because they are all so flat not to mention boring that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them you are never pulled into the story because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place the acting ranges from average van dien to downright atrocious rubin and most of the supporting cast the music is abysmal generic techno and the photography is one of the worst i have ever seen of course like every fiasco of the genre we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity br br 3 10
<START> this is the most boring pretentious and stupid film i have seen in a long time i saw it at the academy in beverly hills and there were quite a few people in the lobby who had left the screening and were seeking refuge there all were solemnly shaking their heads and looking as though they had been to a funeral what a waste of time and money even worse are the critics who gave this pretentious blimp good reviews what's with them are they just afraid they won't be considered hip were they bribed this film is staggeringly bad don't take a date to it expecting to have an in depth chat at the cheesecake factory afterwards if going to see this film was your idea she'll you and hold it over you the rest of your life
<START> i think that saying this film has too many is not what makes this film bad the twists are not the problem of the film the story is quite clever and could have been very cool if filmed right the major problems why everyone is complaining about the twists in the film is that the film is just not fascinating enough to make people follow them the film is badly shot at least in comparison to its genre brother lock stock worse the characters are although often well acted just plain flat the characters don't have enough time to be introduced well enough to let the viewer get involved with a single one of them let alone understand them oh and the locations are just terrible locations person i didn't bother to watch the credits for your name get another job maybe still photography or interior design
<START> this was a surprisingly very good movie and an interesting idea however it was just a little bit disappointing in that the 'twist' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie whilst watching it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow there were superb performances there was never a dull boring moment so totally well worth watching this one it kept me interested right up until the end and for me there isn't many movies that can do that these days i highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie
<START> this movie was fun if all over the board br br it essentially follows the comedic romp of two grave robbers in 19th century england who move from conventional body snatching to trafficking in vampires zombies and dead roswell aliens i have no idea what the roswell alien was doing in there and neither did the producers i think br br but was it funny you bet even ron perlman who is often the kiss of direct to dvd death was pretty good in this one as a priest who turns out to be the ringleader of a rival gang of body snatchers br br a real joy to watch this hilarious little film and a good example of what you can do when you don't have larger than life egos on either side of the camera
<START> that's japanese for spiral or vortex is one of the most absurd films i've ever watched a town becomes obsessed and then all consumed by the vortex pattern in some very grotesque ways fingertips are cut off people commit suicide in washing machines just wild and crazy japanese horror possibly as psychologically damaging as the ring generally not as scary as the eye but the imagery in this is more sickening than most of the things in the eye and not as gory as the untold story but that isn't to say there isn't a fair amount of blood and dismemberment seriously if you enjoy horror films and especially asian horror you must add this film to your list a few parts are a little odd with the sound effects the story is adapted from a manga comic and it shows but it really fits unlike some films that try too hard to capture the original source house of the dead this one does it perfectly the most original film you will see not just this year but probably ever recommended
