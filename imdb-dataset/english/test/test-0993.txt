<START> this is a spin off of pulp fiction i thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs well it turns out that this movie really was terrible the whole plot doesn't follow on the pulp fiction plot it turns to other movie like forrest gump and more some laughs came out of this movie but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me if you are thinking of renting this movie please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense please if there is a plump fiction 2 i will definitely not go on and rent the sequel just giving a heads up for those out there
<START> i think several others have already commented on this film but i liked it so well i wanted to just say how good a film this is i gave it a rating of 9 out of 10 it did not get a 10 because it is very slow starting i almost quit on it but am glad i didn't hang in there it is well worth the wait br br this is primarily a film about relationships deceit trust and betrayal br br michelle pfeiffer jessica lange and jason robards all do bang up jobs in this movie br br set in midwest farm country jason robards character is a farmer whose grandfather first settled there jason's character is getting older and he decides to set up a trust dividing the thousand acres of farmland among his three adult daughters that's when the plot of this film really beginning cooking br br sisters turn against each other due to misunderstandings rather than greed over the land they also make some discoveries about each other's childhoods and their present day marriages including an adulterous affair while the father becomes increasingly abusive demanding and paranoid until the terrible truth about everyone finally comes boiling out br br this film really reached me emotionally i got angry right along with some of the characters and sad with them i could feel their pain due to the excellent performances that were given br br the ending was a bit of a surprise to me but in keeping with the growth of the characters br br
<START> i can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than quentin tarantino's at least in his films basterds is no different we all know tarantino the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics such as reservoir dogs and pulp fiction since he has been a disappointment for some well i am relieved to say tarantino has not lost his touch he brings us his best since pulp fiction and thankfully so br br we know the story a wwii tale told only as tarantino can fictional of course a war film hasn't been done like this before brad pitt as lt aldo raine leads the basterds in nazi occupied france their goal killin' nazi's christoph waltz as colonel hans landa plays a similar role on the other side he's know as the jew hunter and goes about his business as ruthless as no other the third sub story consists of a young jewish refugee dreyfus who witnesses the slaughter of her family and she of course wishes to plot revenge on the germans for her devastating lose there actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other if you know anything about tarantino or his films this is nothing new for him br br war has never been been so fun the basterds are haunting but at the same time very funny at times even hilarious the dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other tarantino films the entertainment and hilarity is led by brad pitt i found him extremely funny and entertaining i couldn't wait to see him on screen again even with his crazy accent he works in this type of film also making great impressions were mÃ©lanie laurent and christoph waltz who were tremendous the film was filled with noteworthy performances br br the story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to even count but so what it isn't meant to be a documentary tarantino wanted to have fun with as should we the cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film you've really got to love the last line in the film but pulp fiction remains his masterpiece br br quentin tarantino among all other things is an entertainer wwii is one of the most tragic events in history but tarantino some how manages to make it fun basterds is a fun film it's tremendously entertaining shocking dramatic suspenseful and funny at the same time jam packed with everything you look for in a movie done with that certain tarantino style it's worth being checked out it's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of quentin tarantino
<START> not a larry masterpiece but it stands on its own as a good western any of the lonesome doves do who ever takes on the role of woodrow call does a great portrayal in their own style it's also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a stepping stone to the t v series both version of it and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive william peterson was awesome in this the geeky c s i guy is not the character he plays in this this guy can do it all it seems br br it's deserve to be enjoyed by those who enjoy westerns br br stars
<START> head is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 the movie is a complete contradiction of the monkees image it presents the monkees in a way their fans never perceived them men with real thoughts totally controlled by their producers the monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story the film pokes fun at their image the entertainment industry and corporate america the soundtrack contains some of their best music it's a movie well worth seeing over and over again
<START> a sleeper i had never even heard of this movie until i was channel jumping one night i've been a police officer myself for 25 years and thought this was a true to life movie non police critics are rating the movie purely from a critic's point of view and not from a police officer's point of view this is real
<START> the screenplay is the worst part of this film as it lurches from one premise to the next missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible this film is confusing because the audience doesn't know what the story is i had no problem with the low production values and the acting wasn't great but this is telly so it was fine i don't mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take but having such a non sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash avoid this at all costs br br the prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed a voice over to fill in all the details that had been left out the prologue was rushed it wasn't clear what was happening ie the russian revolution was reduced to some riots are happening in petersburg with the next scene being soldiers arresting them i know the basic history of the revolution so i could fill in the details those pesky communists the prologue is best ignored br br this could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is it sets up this premise in the asylum it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film no gone the film assumes she is who she says she is even though there is still no empirical evidence it sets up a melodramatic romance a love so strong it'll believe anything she says okay a soppy romance no because it makes no sense the love interest seems like a crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic bursting out in wild gestures this also doesn't work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end they never got married and she returned to america the love story collapses despite there being plenty of love scenes i was never convinced of the reason that they were in love i find rom com romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they've even spent any time with each other br br it could have been a thriller type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity no the court case is summed up rather than dealt with the bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of a better film br br the funniest thing to consider is what really happened anna anderson was a loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together throughout her life she had bouts of lunatic behaviour none of this in the film either there's a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a 'one flew over the cuckoo's next 'twelve monkeys' type informant thankfully she vanishes having brought nothing to the story
<START> watch the beguiled because it's a good place to begin when you study the femmes fatales in clint eastwood's filmography br br the smothering gothic sexuality of the beguiled has already been discussed what everyone missed is the synchronized sexual that occurs in a group of females living together especially when a man is introduced into the group they all become horny and then bitchy at the same time br br femme fatal filmography for clint eastwood inger stevens hang 'em high 1968 jean seberg paint your wagon 1969 shirley maclaine two mules for sister sara 1970 page the beguiled 1971 jessica walters play misty for me 1971 sondra locke sudden impact 1983 genevieve tightrope 1984 marsha mason heartbreak ridge 1986 peters pink cadillac 1989 and the best heart breaker of all meryl streep the bridges of madison county 1995
<START> in 1968 stanley kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by arthur c clark it was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts his style of movie making is still fresh and intact br br i have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and i even have a vhs copy of the movie in my library class made me to see the movie again with another perspective who is hal and what is he thinking br br i enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of hal's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie in the second scene dr dave bowman and dr frank poole are eating their food in front of two tv monitor on their sides and hal's round reddish glass dome is in the middle of them in the tv report hal was introduced as the new generation of super computer put in work in january 12 1992 called hal 9000 series during the interview hal reacts as a humble working machine trying to accomplish the mission of the spaceship fully br br in another scene dave is sketching dr hunter dr and dr kaminsky who they are all in hibernation sleep hal is curious to see those sketches and brings up his doubtful question about the purpose of the jupiter mission his calm and monotone voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully br br in the next few scenes we will see how hal tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes the power his conscious makes him capable to try to save his life from termination when dave wants to return to the spaceship and hal does not listen to him there is the most memorable line of the move ' i'm sorry dave i am afraid i can't do that ' in the middle of the most important interact between human and machine hal's voice can conjure both solid calm and malevolence in the same monotone br br dave has gone back to the ship lost all his fellow astronauts and determined to disconnect the hal's main brain cells hal uses his final apologetic techniques to convince dave of not him hal begs him to stop and let him correct himself these are his famous lines while dave is his one by one br br what do you think you are doing br br dave i am entitled to the answer of the question br br i know everything is not quiet right with me br br but i feel much better knowÂ br br i can see are really upset about this very poor decision of mine br br dave stop will you br br dave stop br br i am afraid dave ' br br hal's voice is slowing down during this process and becomes thicker and less audible br br 'my mind is i can feel it' br br 'can i sing a song for you ' br br dave is putting final out and let hal to sing his song called 'daisy' br br give meÂ br br your answer to meÂ br br i am br br although i am not br br hal dies as the jupiter mission br br artificial god bless you hal store in peace
<START> i caught this for the first time a few nights ago on television i expected to only tune in for a few minutes but found myself intrigued by the movie i ended up watching it all and found it surprisingly compelling the acting by the three american leads was quite good especially that of alex cord he plays a gunslinger with quite a degree of vulnerability very different from how most of them are portrayed in westerns he ended up in several situations where he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters the final shootout between the three leads and the bad guys was very good as was the scene where the doctor digs a bullet out of clay mccord somewhat gruesome but realistic i must admit that despite my initial misgivings at watching a spaghetti western i ended up enjoying this film quite a bit i would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns
<START> it infuriates me no end that now and forever i will have to identify this movie which i consider a masterpiece and i don't use that word lightly with the qualifier not the michael douglas movie not only are the titles the same but they refer to the same thing the radioactive fallout that upon the survivors of the first nuclear bombings in imamura's film this is no cheap metaphor the whole movie is about the fallout physical and emotional from hiroshima and the war itself as the deterioration of a couple and their grown niece becomes more grimly clear the ironic imagery becomes more potent from the old clock that is reset each night to the stone gods that gradually pile up outside the heroine's door these in turn are carved by a shellshocked veteran who is compelled in a series of episodes to attack anything with a motor that approaches the town the bombing day itself is shown in piecemeal flashbacks that are coolly horrifying yet black rain can be watched even repeatedly because of imamura's compassion for his characters i repeat a masterpiece
<START> forget easy rider head is the film about the 1960s br br almost laugh as the monkees reduce their entire career to a one minute tv commercial about see the 50 foot victor mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film hear frank zappa with his pet cow on leash tell jones your music is awfully white experience the only live performance as a real rock band play the honest to gosh first ever real punk rock song circle sky listen as jones sings a harry nielsen song about having a transsexual father be confused be very confused as confused as terri garr is when mickey dolenz makes sexual innuendos about her in her film debut witness futile protests against the vietnam war leap out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear watch mike spit on christmas while wearing a velvet victorian smoking jacket in a gothic horror movie sound stage let yourself drift into the karmic bliss inspired by a comic book version of indian mysticism delivered by a hammy white character actor in black face while peter pretends that he knows how to play a guitar discover academy award winning director bob first feature length film as written by academy award winning actor jack nicholson pretend it's not happening when the monkees commit group suicide by jumping off the golden gate bridge take drugs take a lot of drugs take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did while making this film br br with head the monkees revealed themselves as the entertainers in hollywood history bar none it is bewildering to discover that they blamed the failure of this film on bad promo to be sure the promotion was virtually non existent but did they not recognize how angry how down right depressing how self destructive this film actually is i mean this film is a trip on bad acid to the suicide ward of a mental hospital the only film i know to be this depressing is terry gilliam's brazil and like brazil this film reveals why life in the later 20th century was almost unbearable if you were lucky it's not simply that western culture was suffering from serious information overload but the information itself was just bad bad more bad and dismal in fact it was the overload effect itself that kept people going since this allowed people to keep distracting themselves with one crisis or another if news from vietnam became too much to bear they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising unemployment rate br br the positive response to the reality revealed in head was woodstock three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid and peter townsend almost killing abbie hoffman all taking place behind a steel fence under the lovingly watchful eyes of a veritable army of ny state troopers meaning that the freedom of woodstock nation was as illusory as the song john thought he was singing while so strung out he could barely speak 500 000 assholes too stupid to come in out of the rain was one critic's judgment on woodstock i think it was andy warhol br br the one good thing occurring there was jimi hendrix's star spangled banner two years previously the jimi hendrix experience had gone on their first national tour of america as the warm up band opening for the monkees br br see it's all connected somehow br br you owe it to yourself nay you owe it to your unborn children to see the real 1960s only to be found on film in this bizarre miraculous and utterly absurd tribute to one of the more interesting capitalist scams of the later 20th century
<START> i am a professional musician who was inspired nearly 20 years ago to begin playing guitar after hearing jimmy page on led zeppelin ii while i don't play in the same genre or style the impact of that man has been huge now nearly 20 years later i finally got to see something more than the not so good the song remains the same again i have seen so many bands perform some small some the current 'masters ' no band no where no way has ever been able to pull off the magic that you can actually taste by watching this dvd br br robert plant can be a bit much at times and you can nearly sense page's annoyance for him forgetting lyrics but that didn't matter i guess especially for the era genius shines more on this dvd then on any album with zeppelin the band of joy or lord is pretty ordinary but the magic of this dvd is how well the four of them perform together the world loved to imagine that they were into black magic k etc that was only a matter of interest to page the magic notice i say this a lot is that this dvd captures a rare glance to the rawness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly no matter how sloppy they are actually playing it didn't matter br br a quick breakdown the first of the two dvd's is where the true magic is you should be able to sense the power and rawness had in their early days by the end of the second dvd page is struggling with his sanity during the songs it's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin so i'd recommend the first disk to any music lover and the second for the only true zeppelin fan br br i may be going too far here for some guitarists but i would say after watching this page is certainly more creative and inventive than hendrix yup i said it and if you disagree watch the dvd
<START> i am not even willing to vote a single star for this crap but imdb have zero as rating option worst movie i have ever watched story of the movie 1 predator ship crashes on earth 2 one alien and some face huggers are released and they start killing humans 3 one predator arrives on earth and he starts killing aliens and humans 4 then one human jet drops a bomb and kills human aliens and predator 5 some humans find the shoulder canon of the predator 6 the end directors should consider money back to the viewers if still you want to watch this movie download from some torrent site and say thanks to me for saving you money all the movie has been filmed in some dark corner of the earth you see just dark shadows even in action scenes too much violence i didn't expect it from a fox movie
<START> although many billie dove fans are delighted with her work here i have to pass as a socially prominent member of the british smart set her british accent is basically non existent and her line readings sound just like well line readings and her emoting seems trance like and ponderous basil rathbone usually a fine actor seems off kilter throughout and also speaks with a weird sort of accent in his case something like italian though we cannot be sure the script manages to keep his precise ethnicity a secret he is further hampered by the script which gives him one of those old movie diseases something to do with nerves which requires surgery the only real entertainment is provided by the illustrious kay francis sporting a lacquered bob with side curls in her role as a depraved countess who shamelessly devours men including rathbone and then spits them out she pulls it off with her unique aplomb she is the only living thing in this dead sea of a film
