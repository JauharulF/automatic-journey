<START> in the '60's '70's david jason was renowned for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as 'do not adjust your set ' at and the 'doctor' series it was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role in london weekend television's 'the top secret life of edgar briggs' written by richard bernard mckenna br br edgar briggs is a secret agent of the 's i 'secret intelligence service' he genuinely tries to do his job well but always seems to mess things up astonishingly enough though he always succeeds in getting to the bottom of cases much to the amazement of his colleagues michael stainton mark eden and the lovely elisabeth all of which answer to 'the noel coleman br br briggs is married to barbara angell a woman who much like michele from 'some mother's do 'em ' has the patience of a saint and stands by her hare brained but well meaning husband no matter what br br like 'some mother's do and 'the baldy man' 't t s l o e b' was laced completely with slapstick each episode saw jason perform stunts such as plummeting from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating his flat it was pie in the face' stuff really br br briggs' was not a big hit due to poor scheduling from i t v a shame as it was an amusing and enjoyable show well served by its star and the fine support cast the leading man though did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show david jason repeat screenings of the show because he felt his acting in it was non refined granted the david jason who played boy' and is way different to the one that played briggs but by no means was his acting unrefined most actors would have turned briggs into a ridiculous caricature but jason's performance made briggs a credible realistic figure odd perhaps but not unimaginable br br jason's next vehicle was 'lucky in which he played mummy's boy it too failed to make the ratings his lucky break came in the shape of a t 'a sharp intake of in which he played walking disaster area for four series between 1977 1981 so while not outstanding as such is an easy and worthwhile watch nice 'james style theme tune too
<START> this was one of the few shows that my wife and i agreed on watching i was upset to hear that it was canceled especially because i didn't realize the ratings were so poor as far as i knew it was doing very well with a lot of viewers almost all my friends and most of the people i spoke to watched the show now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or dvd's how bad was the show doing does anyone know the real results of the shows viewings i know that when it went to thursdays it was more difficult for me to catch thank g d for br br anyways this was a real surprise to know that there will be no more the war at home if any other networks see this please pick up the show please
<START> before i start i need to inform you that i love horror films with a passion love them i have seen thousands and rarely does one come along that i do not like i am very forgiving of the horror genre one of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film ed wood where ed wood johnny depp freaks out and yells at the overly critical producers after they comment on plan 9's cheap sets and continuity problems you don't know anything haven't you ever heard of of disbelief ' well i try to bring that suspension of disbelief philosophy with me to every horror film i see and it usually works unfortunately it didn't work for me during the screening of cheerleader massacre br br strike one br br the first thing you'll notice about this film is that it is shot on video and has that crummy hand held home digital camera style the camera work and quality are so bad it makes daytime soaps look breathtaking in comparison in fact it makes troma and full moon video releases look good and that's bad br br strike two br br jim wynorski this filmmaker probably fancies himself a chip off the ol' corman but nothing could be further from the truth roger corman shot fast furious and under budget but was able to deliver a tight original film though wynorski delivers a cheap film he cheats his viewers and perhaps other artists as he steals entire pieces of james horner's humanoids from the deep and battle beyond the stars musical scores and inappropriately drops them into cheerleader massacre on the back of the box art and during the beginning credits the music score is falsely attributed to dan an extra in deathstalker ii you will also notice how cheerleader massacre jumps from video to film and back again as wynorski lifts entire scenes from both slumber party massacre and humanoids from the deep wynorski utilized this deception fourteen years earlier in his horrible version of not of this earth br br strike three you're out br br while cheerleader massacre does have some nudity 40 year olds playing teenagers and the grossest set of fake breasts that i have ever seen in a horror film ugh the murders are relatively bloodless what the heck is that all about the film is titled cheerleader massacre but a handful of off screen killings in my opinion does not add up to a massacre it doesn't even add up to a bad mosquito bite br br the film's story is fair enough unseen killer stalks a vanload of cheerleaders old gals playing teens until the van runs out of gas and the girls are forced to hold up in secluded two story mountain home i won't ruin the ending for you but this is one of those films where the person who is obviously the killer is not obviously the killer cheerleader massacre would have been great if it were shot on film directed by joseph and had special effects by tom savini instead it is an effect less shot on video travesty by jim wynorski ouch br br i beg of you please don't buy or rent this abomination if we keep supporting these clowns the more of this talentless video garbage they'll produce go out and rent the prowler the last house on dead end street delirium or the burning instead you'll be glad you did
<START> was in the mood for a french film and saw this at blockbuster what a little gem it turned out to be not sure how i missed all these years but he is fantastic such innocence and grace i love his face and the way he moves isabelle adjani was hilarious reminded me of nicole kidman's over the top performance in moulin rouge she looks the same as 20 years ago truly remarkable gerard depardieu has not held up nearly as well but his acting continues to amaze he's perfect in this film will probably buy this one i enjoyed it so much if you want to see another great french movie rent noel stunning
<START> when the legends die is a powerful moving story of an orphaned ute indian who goes on to become tom black bull a champion rider raised in the old ways tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world bitter about the role he has been forced into tom finds fulfillment doing one thing busting horses riding them to death in the rodeo the movie has richard widmark in the role of red the man who befriends tom and acts as his manager red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story which is about where the movie ends the real story is completely ignored the dark side of tom black bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas oh well you should read the book this movie doesn't come close to doing the story justice
<START> the only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of and jack their choices and viewpoints and the philosophical questions that it raises feels that she is helping people who aren't supposed to die and jack feels that they are supposed to die and she is messing with plan or the plan or such whatnot br br but she is obviously able to change things so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series' metaphysics jack has no basis for believing that there is and very conveniently never asks him the right questions nobody does which obviously proves that the makers of the series don't have an answer br br there simply is no plot br br instead they leave it murky in order for the series to be able to continue with it's boring girl stuff only occasionally interrupted by and jack's racing against each other towards ends that are unknown br br it turns out that there is nothing to any of it a teenage pop series with that pretends to be something else br br your time will be better spent sleeping
<START> let's face it a truly awful movie no i mean a truly awful movie is a rare strange and beautiful thing to behold i that there is a special place in my heart for films like plan 9 from outer space half caste species etc and although i'm giving this film a 1 i highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is a bad film to find a friend snacks something to drink and make the special occasion it deserves out of aussie park boyz br br from the very first moments of the lead actor's side to side eye rolling performance as he attempts to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera a slice of ham straight out of silent pictures eat your heart out rudolph valentino to the sudden hey we're out of film conclusion you will not stop laughing br br to sum the film up its a poor man's warriors down under complete and that description alone should be enough but then comes the wonders of the spaghetti eating scene the 'we've got their tickets they won't be leaving town now' scene it's the asians run and more the only truly objectionable part is a gratuitously filmed rape outside of this i dare you to watch this film and i dare you to find evidence of acting or lines or direction or any of those other boring and superfluous elements that so called critics say a film needs to be judged as good br br if this movie doesn't cause fits of uncontrollable laughter before it ends all i can do is roll my eyes menacingly from side to side at you and shout you dog you dog you dog
<START> sometimes the academy doesn't recognize the potential of some films or doesn't nominate them because they are controversial or strong sometimes they are nominated but don't win anything i hope this doesn't happen this year with american beauty this is exactly what happened with boogie nights which was the best film of 1997 the academy preferred to give the best picture oscar to titanic a purely commercial and hollow film and other awards to the overrated good will hunting and the irritating full monty the other pictures which were nominated in the main category were l a confidential and as good as it gets great movies but boogie nights is still better and should have been remembered in more categories br br this amazing film tells the story of eddie adams mark wahlberg in a surprisingly great performance a 17 year old barman who takes the attention of jack horner burt reynolds in a redeeming acting a director of porn films eddie has a special 'gift' and this helps him to get into the world of porn movies he changes his name for dirk diggler and starts to make a huge success but fame doesn't last forever other characters also have their parallel stories amber waves julianne moore perfect buck don cheadle and others including heather graham an actress who accepts to do anything but she has to be wearing her roller shoes br br what could have been a banal trivial film turns into a perfect memorable one in the hands of paul thomas anderson what makes boogie nights such a great film is its execution added to a clever well written screenplay great soundtrack etc each character is very well developed and each of them has his her importance in the context each feeling weakness fear emotion is explored resulting in a masterpiece of the modern american cinema br br boogie nights is a strong impacting picture that should be seen by everyone who really likes cinema under a plot that seems banal at first impression there is a wonderful story of highs and downs things that we face in our lives it is an amazing portrait of the end of the '70s and the beginning of the '80s exactly an age of highs and downs that's what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece br br 10 10
<START> this movie was just horrendous how could anybody like this movie and for the ones who liked it because of the jokes they should really take a long hard look in the mirror and ask themselves if stereotypes are not bad ignoring the face of the racial stereotypes this was just awful it never had its moments if it paid homage to 1980's airplane it needs to pay some more awful acting terrible script writing even for a movie with mo'nique or tom arnold this movie was bad from the beginning but people might have seen the whole thing by the thought that the plane would crash one of the worse movies ever stay away
<START> the most spiritual film i have seen in a long long time maybe ever also one scene around the dining room table a piece of comic perfection i understand a release date is coming up in the fall if it comes to your town and you want to see a movie that makes you think this is it is great in it and she is most certainly a future star superbad is out now which she is in also all the actors seem perfectly calibrated there is a tone set by this movie that is used to surprise through out i would not know what to call it it is comedy but the message is so fierce and direct that comedy is not a big enough word for it i love this film it is a thinking man's comedy but even that phrase is not really good enough does have a message and that message needs to be heard right now
<START> working in a music store my first tipped me this soundtrack the music of this movie is perfect one of my favorite cd's only years later i saw the movie i was afraid it would not fulfill my high expectations luckily it did a feel good romantic love story
<START> warning contains mild spoiler a movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of it it's confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary withdrawal points rather than refuges as the characters become increasingly preoccupied by the past the present increasingly falls away until the ultimate incendiary appearance of the countess in the black mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy whether or not their stories are true and whether stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories seems impossible to determine the theme seems to be how love of an extreme and unconsidered nature messes with stability to the point where reality itself breaks down where exotic misplaced fantasy becomes dangerously tangible the image of the burning motel a symbol of dislocation beset by destruction is an appropriately weird ending for this strange but effective startlingly imaginative movie
<START> aside from the gunfight scene i felt the movie was a waste of celluloid robert duvall kevin costner and annette bening could have played those roles in their sleep the dialog was marginally tolerable and there was plenty of it no one sat together quietly in this movie the plot was all over the map as if they could not decide how many themes to cram into the story there was no subtlety at all foreshadowing hit you between the eyes and they led you by the nose through most of the story i think they added all the dialog to make sure you didn't miss anything and the editing really needed tightening up each actor's screen time was more quantity than quality again too much dialog br br the entire story took place over the course of a few days but everything that happened took on epic proportions much like how day to day happenings seemed huge to you in high school but in the grand scheme really weren't that important yes the bad guys beat up and killed they beat up button they killed the dog all things which would get boss and blood up but the importance was diluted by all of the deep meaningful conversations which dominated most of the movie these guys worked together for 10 years and they're just now talking about this stuff the only time there wasn't much dialog was in the gunfight scene which is probably why i liked it br br finally someone give annette bening a the wispy strands of hair around her face that were i suppose to make her look a bit more romantic actually made her look a little deranged if she worked outside the home it would have made more sense plus why wasn't she married already there seemed to be several kind and gentle her words single men in town aside from the marshal and his cronies in fact none of the bad guys seemed to want her either a usual plot device in other movies she stayed cooped up in the house most of the time and really didn't seem to have much connection to the people in town makes you wonder br br in all the movie was entirely too long too chatty and too contrived for me it felt like a star vehicle with lots of screen time for the big stars but not enough character depth to interest me despite all of the dialog
<START> this was the film that first indicated to me what a great actor martin sheen really is he modestly claims that charlie is a better actor charlie can't hold a candle to him br br i found it suspenseful and thoroughly enjoyed the intertwining of the love story with the main plot and i usually hate love stories there's a great plot twist at the end that struck me as being fully credible particularly in the early 80's time period and probably now also br br the final scene had me on the edge of my seat this film roundly illustrates that treachery is often doled out by those we trust while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect and finally that human compassion can be found where we least expect it br br
<START> a very funny look at some of australia's current affairs and political goings on the chaser boys really seem to have fun with this show and what i enjoy is that they all have their strengths some are brilliant at making complete idiots of themselves whereas julian can pull off the whole i'm interviewing a famous politician and i'm about to suggest that he disguise himself as a pot of jam type of humour br br they have great segments in the show taking the mick out of all sorts of aspects of australian culture such as our current affairs shows our adverts and early morning tv programmes some material is a bit tired and predictable but overall it's a lot of fun to watch and will leave you with a smile on your face
