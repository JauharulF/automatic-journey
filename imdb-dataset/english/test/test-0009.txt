<START> this movie is recommended only for insomniacs it will relieve them by putting them to sleep five year olds might also enjoy it but for anyone else including fans of the genre what a bore the ancient plot is reminiscent of return of the dragon and this film is just as inept but nero is no bruce lee so enter the ninja is an even worse film until now this is the second the offensive comedy bachelor party was the first film i gave 1 10 to
<START> ok no one will confuse this with citizen kane but you've got to love a movie where the women are always topless there are a few catfights and some kinky sex as well on the other hand i hope they didn't the guy who wrote the dialogue here's a prime example after one of the captive girls dies br br this is terrible it reminds me of the day zenobia died a relative no my favorite cow i guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile i will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine work of art never a good sign i guess that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same i hope the folks waiting to rent it next didn't get too impatient don't worry folks it's on it's way
<START> 36 100 this is not to be confused with the decent arachnophobia this film is a very low budget and cheap rip off of that movie this one is so bad it actually does have some entertainment value on that level there are numerous unintended i think laugh out loud scenes i wasn't expecting much from the film and it was actually worse than i had imagined it would be br br it's a clichÃ© ridden and predictable direct to video mess fortunately it doesn't take itself too seriously the acting as expected is not quite oscar caliber the special effects are poor worse than i would have thought they would be poorly edited and the score is intrusive
<START> this movie starts at a and never quite reaches b its title promises far more than the film delivers it's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality the people are agreeable even the obligatory flamboyant type the lead kevin mckidd overacts insofar as there's a reason for him to act at all simon callow playing a horny straight is always worth watching and he's by far the only reason to stay with the movie however the rubbish about his men's group meditations or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order they seem to have been thrown into the movie's mild mix in a misguided effort to vary the setting and non stop inaction the same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip don't worry about pausing the tape so you can get a snack let the thing run you won't miss anything hugo weaving's character is superfluous he appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesn't even meet the rest at all the outcome of that sequence isn't explained and hugo's real estate dealings have nothing to do with the story the movie is a total disappointment at the end because there is no resolution the thing simply fades out and we're sent to the closing credits this is an interlude with no structure
<START> some people like to tell you that deep space 9 is the best of all the star trek shows because it stresses character development and continuity and features a more complex background and ongoing plots in some ways this makes it more satisfying but in many ways the show fails entirely br br the series starts out as a soap opera on a space station with two entire seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with banal subplots about the characters the characters are a good bunch and most of the actors are decent but i think the writers tried too hard to make them normal by normal they actually mean ordinary and tedious br br at the end of season two we are introduced to the dominion who hang around menacingly for a while before finally going to war with the good guys in season five this is the main story arc of the show but it only takes up a fraction of the entire series we still get lame stand alone episodes heroes still get stranded on weird planets for forty five minutes and there's an awful lot of low brow comedy featuring the greedy goofy ferengi a lot of episodes are merely dull and some are unwatchable br br the dominion main villains are bent on galactic domination for the convenient reason that well they just don't like anyone the entire war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination impressively space battles appear with great frequency from season three onwards but these are carried out in ludicrously simplistic ways such as two huge of super advanced starships flying right at each other and blasting away the writers of ds9 including the talented ronald d moore later of battlestar galactica fame spiced up their monotonous show by starting a war but at heart it is still a pedantic soap br br ds9 remains a very frustrating experience the continuous story is too flat and obvious to be really gripping and the characters never truly develop in interesting ways babylon 5 and battlestar galactica both fulfilled the promise made by ds9 and did everything much better for star trek stick with the original and the next generation
<START> chucky the murderous doll from child's play and 2 crappy sequels is dead but his ex girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly gets his remains and using voodoo for dummies revives him then through circumstances too convoluted to get into she is killed and has her soul put into another doll together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple nick katherine heigl to take them to chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make chucky and tiffany real people again br br a lot better than it sounds after the last two sequels to child's play both of which were horrible i was expecting the worst but this actually was lots of fun the movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second seriously how could it and the lines and situations are actually quite funny also there are a few very gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving the movie also has a few things usually not found in a horror movie a gay best friend gordon michael who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which has his shirt off just to show his muscular body john ritter has a nice cameo too as a sheriff br br the acting is good is young very handsome and likable heigl doesn't have much to do but pulls it off and brad dourif the voice of chucky and tilly are hilarious as the murderous dolls my favorite part is when the dolls have sex don't ask and she asks for a rubber and he responds but i'm made of rubber the special effects are good no lousy cgi here and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way well worth seeing i give it a 9
<START> what do you do with all the material that does not make the final edit of a film you might keep it aside in case a director's cut or extended version is released one day you might sell some it as stock footage to be used in a part of another film you might just bin it or you might collect it accumulating more and more from each film you make and then use it to make another film disregarding coherence or any sense throw a very primitive skeleton of a narrative into it and line up a number opportunities nay excuses to slot in your celluloid cast offs excuse the abjectly nonsensical nature of the plot by framing it all in the mind of a horror film director and you've got yourself an awful film this can all be done with just a few days shooting and idiots like me will waste two hours of their life watching it and then come on here and try to warn others away the whole chain of events is one big waste of time
<START> what gives this movie its personality is the knowledge in the end that it is all true while it is a compelling and humorous documentary that does border on mockumentary in some parts are they staged or is it really happening humorously it does seem to get a bit long towards the end br br this movie is funny in places it needs to be and flows relatively well reminiscent of christopher guest's movies if you liked those or adaptation then i recommend you keep a look out for this one br br b
<START> big spoilers flesh feast of 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great veronica lake's career this has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker and rightly so i must say as a huge fan of low budget horror exploitation especially from the 70s i nonetheless chose to watch this mainly due to the cool camp looking picture on this site but after watching it i had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film the picture here on this site is the cover of a dvd collection entitled feast' containing four films including sergio martino's mountain of the cannibal god and i eat your skin what the collection does not include however is this boring turkey flesh feast is not only camp and ridiculous but mostly quite tedious which is even more pathetic regarding that the film is only 70 minutes long also don't get fooled by the title the film is not gory at all yet it is watchable if only for its trashiness and especially the extremely stupid but therefore somewhat entertaining ending the film follows a ridiculous plot about dr elaine frederick veronica lake an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with the help of flesh eating maggots don't ask how a bunch of criminals or terrorists or whatever who are paid by a radical political group assign the doctor to restore the youth of a 'mysterious' commander after an endless hour of nonsensical drivel it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually hitler himself it was quite obvious before but i still had to burst out laughing because the film's finale was so unbelievably silly and unintentionally hilarious this is a film that is very inadequate as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen like veronika lake except for lake the performances are ridiculously bad even for a zero budget production like this bad performances however are something i can easily forgive in films like this one what i can not forgive though is extreme boredom the final five minutes make this watchable for hardcore fans of camp stuff but i would still recommend to skip it
<START> here's a couple of paragraphs out of an essay i wrote for university about br br the book of revelation is an erotic thriller about sex power and a talented dancer's struggle to regain his sense of self after being unfortunately raped by three cloaked women the three women that violate him all have distinctive marks on the bodies one has a giant birth mark on her buttocks another has a butterfly tattoo on her lower stomach and the ring leader has a small circle on her breast so he lives his new life in search of these markings and to find them on these intimate places he does what any sane man does when he needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery he has sex with them an hour and ten minutes into the film and you feel like he has almost had a piece of every woman in melbourne br br the film is a giant chunk of pretentious celluloid it is like drips from every frame at only one point towards the films final climax does give a scene the same energy and strength as her debut feature head on had in droves as like many films funded by the government bodies the film takes it self way to seriously the script and its execution appear to be chores rather then gifts and unfortunately for the talented thespians their brilliant performances particularly tom long as the fractured protagonist are stuck within the confines of a pompous wan k fest
<START> rugged david innes solid doug mcclure and dr abner perry a delightfully dotty peter cushing drill their way into the earth's core in their spiffy mole machine the duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men director kevin conner working from a blithely silly script by milton subotsky maintains a constant brisk pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality that's amusing and endearing in equal measure the lovably hokey not so special effects are quite unintentionally funny the cheesy array of cut price creatures in particular are positively sidesplitting cruddy guys in obvious shoddy rubber suits pterodactyl men equally rinky dink savage ape man brutes and a hilariously ludicrous fire belching frog thing who blows up real good one gut busting highlight occurs when mcclure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws moreover we also get some rousing rough'n'ready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt it's a total treat to see cushing gleefully ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely but enthusiastic arrow slinging action hero in the last third of the flick the ever luscious caroline munro looks positively yummy as the fetching princess dia plus there are nice supporting turns by grant as gallant warrior ra and sean lynch as treacherous coward mike neatly varied score alternates between jaunty orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff alan hume's crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the infectiously inane proceedings a complete campy riot
<START> i was shocked to learn that jimmy caan has left this show does anyone know why i regard james as one of the all time greats and wasn't surprised he ended up on tv which can be better than the crap you see on the big screen the stories are slick and the camera faster than a speeding bullet mustn't forget the rest of the cast james vanessa yum nikki molly josh mitch also can anyone tell me why on earth there's a crap theme tune on the dvd sets but elvis's remix of a little less conversation is used on the initial nbc broadcasts does it not make sense to use a tune that you would associate with the gambling mecca of america for dvd releases
<START> having enjoyed neil gaiman's writing especially his collaboration with amano in the dream hunters in the past i figured mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed the beginning live action section of the movie was intriguing enough the relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with and i loved the sets the costuming and helena's artwork the subsequent computer generated scenes however were excruciating the dialogue was awkward and pretentious the interaction between the live actors and the cgi horrifying events occurred for the flimsiest reasons and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot may have existed i only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie so i'm not exactly an authority but i strongly recommend that you don't watch any of it at all and stick with gaiman's strong written work
<START> i first watched this movie in istanbul film festival back in 1994 it was so good i took couple of friends with me and went to see it again the same week the characters are very well played and the humor here and there is amazing it sure is a very powerful gay movie some scenes make you feel you're watching an episode of friends with much more sophisticated lines i guess i'll put it in my vcr and watch it again tonight
<START> i kind of liked the film it's just that the characters run around with no real point to their craziness as i was saying poor goat the goat was while the guy was pretending to grind on it i would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic not the one with the goat though jane ryall who played celia only did this one film she was very nude throughout this crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places i almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who are also picked out for being sinners if you like crazy off the wall stuff then this is your film 3 10
