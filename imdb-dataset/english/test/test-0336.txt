<START> four friends was first billed on hbo in 82 as a sleeper hit having heard the term 'sleeper' when 14 back then i was anxious to see one boy was i surprised that film i hadn't really fallen in love with a non special effects film outside of treasure of the sierra madre much less a 'hippy flick' but having had grown up with a couple of hippies i understood the power behind mr penn's film four friends is definitely one of a kind the script is so personable and that cast craig wasson defines so well he just personifies the type' to a tee both smart and clumsy the scene at the window and strong yet so very vulnerable for me he captures what it's like to be so taken with that it lasts over a decade and i have always found solace in the character and in the film throughout the 80's four friends was a partner in crime to me and i caught the movie whenever i could on hbo even if i had to stay up until and still always at the end there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters part from the viewers on the beach jodi personifies that girl to the hilt it is so hard not to be charmed by her this movie really stands the test of time every once and a while i check out my video of it or show a friend and it still gets a solid reaction i've known women who absolutely fall in love with georgia so many levels just an incredible little 60's piece of humanity very special very magical i recently found the novelization of four friends by robert and it's even more detailed that the movie actual dates of events etc a real find and what's more haha i found the novel while thumbing around in a used book store in omaha ne of all places guess you have to have an eye for her when i was in l a in 92 working as an extra i went into a lil shop and there were a ton of stills from the film unfortunately i was broke and couldn't indulge but boy those photos of georgia and the guys all together just went right through me i met director joe on the set of in ks in summer of 92 and we spoke about four friends very cool also working at a video store in omaha in 98 waited on a female who was a relative of jim metzler told her to pass the word on that there was some kid in omaha who was just fanatical about the film and had gotten the utmost out of it once again the movie captures everything that's in character's heart great great work one of and penn's finest efforts steve is sorely missed an incredible writer duncan br br c
<START> live action version of dragonball via taiwan br br evil lord comes to earth to get the seven magic dragon balls er pearls which when brought together will cause a dragon to appear and grant your wish lots of action and bad comedy ensue br br what can i say that the best way to watch this film is with lots of drunk but witty friends doesn't i don't know this is a really bad but funny in the way that really bad movies can be come on this is one of the few martial arts films i've ever seen where you actually see the wires its a live action cartoon and not so far removed from what i've seen of the show that it makes me fearful for the big budget american version now filming br br if you have some drunk friends and feel like picking on a movie see this film if you're going to see it sober like me avoid it
<START> big fat slob 'uncle played by john eats a lot of candy visits the sane members of his family for a week in order to baby sit two cute kids gaby hoffman and culkin and a pretty but snobby teenager jean louisa kelly the shenanigans begin when buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed two sizes too small for his blimp of a body br br mostly dull but peppered with two or three funny scenes including buck trying to get a word in edge wise on the telephone with his angry girlfriend amy madigan and his meeting with a very disgusting clown br br candy looks like he weighs 600 pounds
<START> this film with only two characters takes you closer to these two people the interrogator and the prisoner than most films take you to any character however well crafted br br the sheer confusion terror and pain which madeleine stowe's character undergoes is deeply disturbing as is alan sadistic yet charming interrogator br br this film is all too possible and builds to a shocking climax the effect of the film as a whole leaving you sitting in silence at the end it'll haunt you for a long time
<START> is it just me or are most of the actors in this adaptation miscast age wise br br redgrave although a superior actress seems as if she should be joining her children instead of nodding off on the couch i would have loved to see brenda in the part her connection to the latest pride and prejudice notwithstanding br br blake and rory kinnear were the only two whom i felt lived up to their characters in spirit and performance every else looked confused or out of place br br luckily i'm not very familiar with dr who i've only seen a few episodes so far or it would have definitely soured this further br br too bad mansfield park has not yet seen its due on screen either large or small this novel requires the talent of a robert altman to balance all the complexities of the characters successfully
<START> words cannot express how poor this film is br br there is no plot the acting is appalling basically the whole film is a joke br br with a running time of 97 minutes it's about 96 minutes too long br br it might have been ok as a short sketch on a comedy show but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking in br br avoid this one go rent a good movie instead
<START> if it wasn't meant to be a comedy the filmmakers sure goofed if they intended for it to be a comedy they hit the mark our critic says homegrown is a wonderful film filled with family values and community spirit recommends it for all audiences and says that he really liked jamie lee curtis's performance it deserves a theatrical re release
<START> the beguiled was one of the few early eastwood films i hadn't seen until i gave the dvd a spin today and from it's opening sepia tinged shot to the macabre climax i was utterly enthralled too many film makers these days substitute special effects fast editing and dizzying camera work in place of character driven stories but director don siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot and the characters are believable and compelling br br the story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be situated on the edge of various skirmishes during the american civil war the south supporting ladies find a badly wounded union soldier clint eastwood nursing him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own ends br br geraldine page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed for a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest there's even a chance that the normal status quo long abandoned when eastwood's machinations are uncovered could return but the mistresses and pupils descend upon a darker road br br this is a totally different style of film from the same director's dirty harry made in the same year and yet they are both equally superb eastwood is great playing against his usual stoic anti hero image yet there's also some mysterious quality attached to his character we never really learn much about him prior to his incarceration and the viewer is free to decide upon his well shaded persona villain or victim whatever you think all i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> i am a big fan of works i believe that he was amid the greatest 20th century poets the film itself does a great justice to the bard of hull wonderfully portrayed by all the players in their roles bonneville does do a service to the sexually repressed larkin he avoids an impression and strays from becoming a caricature the use of his poetry was the highlight of the piece itself rather than acting out the massive intensity with which larkin felt the use of his words themselves give a better insight into plot and add a much more sombre but altogether more fascinating atmosphere most enjoyable
<START> if you've been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than paramount latest release 'black snake not exactly looking for what i just described you say well then you best get ya wits 'bout and on down to your local theater and still see it as samuel l jackson's character lazarus would say as long as you're open minded and don't take everything seriously there's no reason you won't leave the theater glad you saw it br br in the third offering from director craig brewer we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims everything is hotter while there we're introduced to the lazarus as previously said played by jackson and the almost always half naked rae a role bravely taken on by christina ricci in the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what we are all human no one is perfect and if everyone would realize that then we'd be a lot better off the question of if this will be understood or be accepted by all who see the film is another story br br one thing not up for debate is how great jackson and ricci both are here you'd think with the role of a sex crazed woman overacting would be a given but no not here ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date then we have jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is sadly the third star of the film justin timberlake who plays military bound boyfriend isn't all that great at the start he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard later on he steps it up some still he's far from the level he reached in 'alpha dog' br br the other thing 'black snake boasts is a splendid soundtrack containing tracks from the black keys john doe pieces from the score done by scott of course four count 'em four tracks from jackson himself it's actually one of his songs the main performance of the film that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection it alone is worth the ticket price other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are 'the 'when the lights go out' from the black keys the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where lazarus sings to rae on a stormy night br br the efforts of craig brewer can't go without mention though his last film which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map what he has done with 'black snake will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry he not only directed but also wrote its screenplay the end result is a story that is surprising and clever as you watch you feel like you know exactly where it's headed despite its valiant composure just as you think you've predicted the next move brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route there are however some within the screenplay the background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing it left me craving for something more exciting after so many highs i guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the film br br i imagine the majority of people who see 'black snake won't enjoy it due to the fact they won't be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are the depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received it's the issues of race religious motives sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything the idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it simply put it's not for everyone like i said to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind or else you're just wasting your money for those of you who can do that i highly recommend it
<START> i guess this is the first time i have seen a roscoe 'fatty' arbuckle movie i really liked him in his title role as a butcher boy the way he moves is very funny in my opinion for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette i think he is a good actor his facial expressions really suit the role he plays for example how he winks at the audience in the end but one might add that that was probably not too difficult anyway i think he would have deserved a longer career as you probably know it was ruined by greedy journalists who made money by printing false accusations that said he was involved in a scandal br br the plot is not very important in the first half fatty and alum are employees at a store and rivals for affection after a heavy food fight is sent to a girls' school by her father the store owner this is the beginning of the second half both fatty and alum enter the school in drag and the fight for continues some of the characters' names are different in the version that i have seen it seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones br br there are a lot of corny gags like food fights and pratfalls but they are done well in my opinion and there are some gags i really liked for example how they make the dog run the pepper mill or is it a coffee mill or the scene when fatty dons a coat although it is obviously not necessary or when miss the head of the girls' school fatty and he her back br br buster keaton is also funny in this his first movie a good addition to the cast in the first half he is a customer at the store in the second half he supports alum in his fight for i liked his acrobatics for example when fatty pushes him from one room of the school to another he doesn't show a simple pratfall but lands on his hands and his head and does a little pirouette watch out for one scene in the food fight alum throws a flour bag at him but it misses and hits the store owner instead that makes buster laugh which must be a rarity since he normally always shows a neutral expression which as you probably also know already got him the nickname 'the great stone face' one more note al st john who plays alum was 'fatty' arbuckle's nephew and later became famous for the role of that he played in lots of westerns br br i don't like this one as much as i like for example 'one week' and 'the films that buster made later without 'fatty' and it didn't make me laugh out loud often but it made me smile a lot so i have given it eight points
<START> this is a decent movie although little bit short in time for me it packs a lot of action grit commonsense and emotions in that time frame matt dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie the emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie it is not typical fancy expensive hollywood cgi action movie but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price my evening was great because of this movie this movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting story and directing i would recommend this movie the character development of the characters were good and makes you believe that were are actually seeing a real event taking place because this movie i believe was made with cheaper budget the acting and quality were much higher
<START> this formulaic film hero's girlfriend marries the villain just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story scott seems too old in this one and too many times his character turns away from decisive action the scenes he responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly he escapes from gang by hiding in a full rain barrel his escape to the high country and pursuit by john russell seem superfluous as does much of the film the plot could have been tightened br br high points of the film seeing tennessee ernie ford without a mustache singing man in the saddle alfonso too brief scenes as a cook the color photography of the high country and the fight scene there with john russell
<START> i had high hopes for this one until they changed the name to 'the shepherd border patrol the lamest movie name ever what was wrong with just 'the this is a by the numbers action flick that tips its hat at many classic van damme films there is a nice bit of action in a bar which reminded me of hard target and universal soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame there is one great line about 'being p ss drunk and carrying a rabbit' and some ok action scenes let down by the cheapness of it all a lot of the times the dialogue doesn't match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot the end fight is one of the better van damme fights except the director tries to go a bit too john woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van damme film br br not good not bad just average generic action
<START> i've described this film as surprising this is true in many respects the subject material black man wrongly accused the characters people you expect to be stereotypes often show uncharacteristic attitudes during the film the production br br all of these factors make for a refreshingly unusual film especially for its time 1949 the only possible spoilers being the sometimes cheesy dialogue and occasional high moral stance br br but if you happen across it when you weren't planning to watch a film you might find yourself like me staying up into the middle of the night just to see what happens br br
