<START> it is impossible to avoid comparing zhang yimou's hero' to ang lee's crouching tiger hidden dragon ' they were both big budget chinese kung fu films with breathtaking cinematography of chinese landscape and a cast of super stars but aside from the obvious there is in fact nothing else to compare hero' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters proving that big name stars beautiful scenery and action effects are no replacement for a director's artistry and vision br br all the marketing hype preceding the premier of hero' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one much anticipated hero' drew movie goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland china and hong kong making it an instant box office success however though the script pleased government censors chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain on line critics both professional and amateur proclaimed the film ideologically disturbing ' from the viewpoint of deep servitude ' written either by an amateur historian or someone with ulterior motives ' one article was simply titled hero you make me sick ' br br the deepest failing of the film is in its plot which is not only morally reprehensible and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but worst of all for a film is boring all blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history but hero' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as stalin or hitler hero' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun instead it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being deep' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy br br though historians agree that the first emperor of china was ruthlessly violent mao was known to have admired this ruler no surprise given own tyrannical rule likewise the communist government in beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the first emperor and its own iron fist methods so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by zhang yimou tony leung one of the stars of hero' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations because it was needed to maintain in china for these remarks tony leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of hong kong but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie br br director zhang yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung fu novels and movies to reveal a higher wisdom unfortunately his version of turns out to be the is right in china where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny the great popularity of the kung fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world one where kung fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice free from fear and winning against all odds with their super human skills only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in china and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions going against this tradition of the kung fu hero zhang yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth as he had hoped but downwards to the level of government propaganda it's no wonder the government was so pleased br br some film lovers may secretly wonder all moralistic judgments aside is it at least entertaining ' fortunately the answer is a resounding no ' because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations it becomes tedious to watch moreover the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the real' version emerges br br the film is not without its beautiful images however all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline the use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived and the cinematography appears self consciously rather than truly beautiful great for a trailer but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film br br for those in china who showed disdain for crouching unrealistic kung fu much was expected from hero ' jet li who plays the title role is a real kung fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor his previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities but many hoped that zhang yimou could use li's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities but it was not to be hero' attempts to go beyond the kung fu genre so there are not many fighting scenes and jet li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self sacrifice as the casting director ought to have expected li fails miserably meanwhile the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung fu skill is the first one of the film between li and and donnie yen all the scenes that follow are a disappointment so hero' fails to satisfy even on that level br br though most audiences outside china are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel first emperor it seems even more unlikely that they would accept zhang's version of chinese wisdom ' which is anything but perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of hero' was seen smiling instead of yawning or frowning was at the special screening for chinese government officials br br
<START> this was an abysmal show in short it was about this kid called doug who guilt tripped a lot seriously he could feel guilty over killing a fly then feeling guilty over feeling guilty for killing the fly and so forth the animation was grating and unpleasant and the jokes cheap br br it aired here in sweden as a part of the disney time show and i remember liking it some what but then i turned 13 br br i never got why some of the characters were green and purple too what was up with that br br truly a horrible show it spawned a movie which i've never seen but i don't have any great expectations for that one either
<START> this great film never showed up in my town so actually i didn't have any opportunity to watch it until the late when i caught it on german television i was expecting something of a disaster and found instead a well acted grand western with superb location work the tiny tube couldn't really damage it and there's almost not a dull moment in this 4 hour film so i hope to see it once again on the big screen what a spectacle that would be don't miss it if you ever have the chance unfortunately the harsh treatment of heaven's gate at its opening ruined michael cimino's career and he moved from the passable year of the dragon to the boringly ludicrous the sicilian and the dumb desperate hours
<START> the dominating conflict is between a couple of fine actors huppert and and the horrible script evidently the actors lost since the director screenwriter claude chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of sick imagination to the letter fortunately the powerful performances by huppert and dramatically improve the overall quality of the movie which miraculously gains the depth and humor as for chabrol's persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical it reaches the climax in the final scene which is so incredibly poor that you will wonder which pills he was taking himself while directing it
<START> set in the 1794 the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders gerard depardieu at his finest and robespierre a commanding performance by the polish actor the moderate revolutionary has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre he is opposed to the reign of terror which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens mainly by guillotine who are thought to be opposed to the revolution is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of will lead to them being overthrown and put and his supporters on trial for being traitors this was the first french language film made by after he had arrived in france from poland his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties his previous film man of iron 1981 had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of and the polish leader general and that between and robespierre are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent the film is based on the polish play the affair written by in the 1930s and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind the scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris
<START> so dark the night poses a tough challenge it's very hard to write about it in any detail without ruining it for those who haven't yet seen it since it remains quite obscure that includes just about everybody the movie will strike those familiar with its director joseph h lewis' better known titles in the noir cycle Â gun crazy the big combo even my name is julia ross which in its brevity it resembles Â as an odd choice br br for starters the bucolic french countryside serves as its setting steven a middle aged detective with the in paris sets out for a vacation in the village of ste margot or maybe margaux quite unexpectedly he finds himself falling in love with the daughter even though she's betrothed to a rough hewn local farmer but the siren song of life in paris is hard to resist so she agrees to marry him despite the disparity in their ages which inevitably becomes the talk of the town br br but on the night of their engagement party she fails to return to the inn soon a hunchback finds her body by the river her jealous jilted lover is the logical suspect but he too is found dead then anonymous notes threaten more deaths which come to pass for the first time in his career the bereaved finds himself stumped br br a particularly weak script all but does the movie in it plays like bad cornell woolrich crossed with the murder of roger ackroyd but lewis does this creaky vehicle proud he takes his time near the beginning but then the story Â and the storytelling Â gain momentum alas just about the time the script breaks an burnett lighted and photographed the film with an intriguing leitmotif of peering out of and peeping into windows there's also an effective score by hugo who supplied aural menace to many noirs a good deal of talent has been lavished on so dark the night but at the end it boils down to not much more than a gimmick Â and not a very good gimmick at that it's a one trick pony of a movie br br
<START> it's difficult to decide whether this movie suffers from crap dialogue or if it's just made to appear so by crap actors in any case it suffers from storywriting which is mediocre at best br br although made in the late '80's the first part of the movie plays like a 60's teenage screwball comedy barring the absence of any actual humour especially the part of the 'good girl' which is as annoying a doris day figure as you could hope fear for including the slightly whiny opposition to anything 'fun' her friends want to do the net effect is after a while you start to hope she'll bite it so you don't have to listen to her voice anymore br br some profanity and gratuitous nudity plus some really 80's style clothing is your only clue that this movie was made in the 80's oh and some pretty passable music too br br storywise it's pretty formulaic stuff a bunch of horny apart obviously from 'miss nice girl' teenagers decide to celebrate halloween night by throwing a party in a haunted house partying and fornication ensues along with an ill advised which kicks off the demonic possession spree which is the subject of the movie after this the only suspenseful part will be trying to guess in which order the characters will expire you're sure not to care whether or not they will the actors are so bad that becoming demons zombies dinner actually improves their performance somewhat and the ridiculously clichÃ© dialogue is so annoying that you squirm in your seat br br this flick ain't nuthin' special unless you think cheesy is kind of 'special' for example the demon head which occasionally appears is so screamingly fake that you wonder if it's a 5 year old trick or treating br br this is not to say there's nothing enjoyable in the flick some of the music isn't half bad and the first of our insipid scooby gang to get possessed performs a marvelous and really sexy dance routine at one point before she turns nasty br br also and i don't know why towards the very end of the flick i actually managed to get somewhat involved the suspense lacking in most of the movie made a late appearance and i started to squirm out of unease instead of annoyance which is what a horror movie is supposed to do br br i cannot bring myself to give this movie a rock bottom rating since by some inexplicable miracle i don't rule out being possessed by demons i was actually a little creeped br br don't pay money to see it though it's hardly worth your time yet alone hard cash watch it on youtube while it's there
<START> well i have to agree with the critics on this one who all said leave it alone why they had to make this re make of the 1960 psycho i don't know my guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern day actors were the answer since those were the main changes the dialog was the same and the story the same br br on one hand i applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film yet if they were going to keep everything the same why bother when you weren't going to improve on tony perkins janet leigh and the original cast br br did they honestly think vince vaughn was going to be as good or better than perkins are you kidding ann heche with her short haircut is going to be better than leigh i don't think so br br yes the colors were pretty in here but it's the black and white photography that helped make the 1960 version so creepy to begin with it's perfect for the story not a bunch of greens and pinks once again i guess the filmmakers were banking on an audience that never saw the original br br this was just a stupid project that never should have gotten off the ground
<START> i believe that this is one of elizabeth montgomery's best performances in a movie and i have seen most of her movies i saw this for the first time on television when i was around fourteen and i was so scared i watch this movie every now and then and i still enjoy it very much i know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much that just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so i love movies that do not show the graphic details you let your imagination do the work for you the cast in this movie was top notch jess walton who played the sister in the story was very good even though her part was rather small she also played in a terrific made for television thriller around the same time called you'll never see me again with david hartman i got the biggest kick out of eileen performance as the housekeeper eileen was so good as a lady with a very bad disposition george who played the husband was quite effective this story obviously had a lot of so called mistakes in the plot but i love the movie anyway i highly recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence i gave this movie a vote of seven
<START> when a movie's claim to fame is that martin sheen's younger less known brother stars in it you know it's not gonna' be a real good one is a low budget silly film about a group of 20 something year olds being pursued by an angel of death it's a stupid movie but it is pretty entertaining and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity br br the plot in the film is very small and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be joe estevez isn't much of an actor so luckily for the audience he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking this movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror fantasy franchise considering it has the same plot layout as a slasher 4 characters each dies one at a time will any live who really cares though it sounds like i hated this i didn't i just didn't like it very well but i was interested through most of it so i guess that counts for something br br my rating 1 2 out of 90 mins pg 13 for language violence and nudity
<START> sixth and last movie in the boxset well looks like i've saved the best one for last ghoulies iv i originally did a review for this back in like february but i decided to do a new one the ghoulies series is pretty awesome i know there are some people who don't like them and that's fine this happens to be my favorite one in the series yeah i know the actual ghoulies don't appear and are replaced by 2 guys in costumes one of them being tony cox from bad santa now onto the movie br br the movie centers around jonathan graves the main character from the first movie being played once again by peter who is now a cop for the lapd and has put his past of the occult behind him during the first part of the movie we encounter alexandra played by the very hot stacie randall communicating with a demon from beyond named faust who is the dark side of jonathan faust asks alexandra for a red jewel and something goes awry therefore unleashing the ghoulies from the beyond br br i think jim wynorski did a good job with the directing and the music by chuck is funny as well spoiler ahead at the end of this movie the ghoulies say that there will be a ghoulies iv part 2 or ghoulies v i still hope that sequel gets made and i especially hope jim wynorski returns to direct i agree with on that
<START> in the wake of the matrix this travesty of a film with loose connections to vr has been reissued with the tag line the matrix just got in a box with a very matrix inspired cover still called expect to die though due to the choice of font however the tag line looks to all the world like it says anyway br br to complete the transformation to matrix wannabe they have mocked up a vr fight scene with a morpheus a like on the back of the box it may be important to know that this character does not feature in the film br br overall this film is a travesty on every level jalal is an awful actor and does not impress with his martial arts however his partner stone is played by evan lurie who in this film is simply the worst actor i have ever seen clearly he was chosen to make jalal look good in comparison worst film i have seen for a long long time
<START> i've been a classic horror fan my entire life many nights stretched until the early hours of the morning watching the universal films on horror incorporated and creature feature night sadly i viewed this film in the early evening and yet it still almost put me to sleep br br i don't think i've ever seen a horror picture where everything was so matter of fact dr doesn't seem to believe in the supernatural yet before long he's medically treating dracula and watching larry talbot change into the wolfman while hardly blinking an eye he and talbot discover the frankenstein monster like it's an everyday occurrence is all fired up to bring the monster back to life but after talbot and nina protest he's like aww you're right no big deal after realizing dracula's treachery he opens the count's coffin to sunlight and poof he's gone just like that br br the only person who didn't appear to just be phoning in her lines was jane adams as nina her reward is getting bounced off the hump in her back into a pit by the frankenstein monster at the end of the film and no one even tries to rescue her she dr and the monster all perish while talbot and casually leave the castle br br definitely the low point for universal during it's classic horror years
<START> i have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this film no plot very limited action and what is with the 3rd person commentary throughout the film instead of running around the planet to shoot on all of these locations they should have spent some money on script writing and actors what acting there was was lousy this was 90 minutes of my life i will never be able to get back i should bill the director for the cost of renting this film to the director and the writers of this film please quit now this film should have a tag on the front of it saying beware of boredom the only good thing i can say about this film is the computer generation it's ok as generation is this movie should never have a sequel ever
<START> teen is a great film a very breezy entertainer and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s the music and songs are terrific though the lyrics of are meaningless at places dev anand is a tremendous star and as usual does great justice to his role is sexy and is ok simi too is just about ok the film has terrific dialogue by who wrote most of dev anand's films like mahal warrant note manzil etc etc br br it is a story of dev getting attracted to three females the mod simi and the homely he eventually opts for the story is about ok but its been narrated in a gripping way and the dialogue and songs and the great dev anand are the highlight of the film a must watch film for all dev anand fans
