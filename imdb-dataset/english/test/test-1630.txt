<START> this movie really sucks this is my second review because its so bad the girl on the cover is hot but the girl in the movie is not i cant believe it was rated r there is no violence no sex no nudity no swearing nothing really crap film
<START> i've been a huge fan of the videos jackass and viva la bam for a long time they've had a great run and i expected my laughter to end eventually but it hasn't yet this movie kept my mouth open the entire time i'm still laughing randomly i went to the theater with low expectations thinking it wasn't going to be better than the first oh how incredibly wrong i was br br there were many great moments in the movie if you're squeamish don't like randomly placed raw humor or if you disliked the first movie you probably won't like this but with that said i almost wet my pants from laughing so hard it had all kinds of different pranks masochistic humor toilet humor puking laughing some great falls and massive damage done to all of the cast ryan dunn even branded rear end with an image that will be stuck there for a long time i'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is br br no pain no gain right this movie has already done well causing theaters all over america to laugh so hard they'll be wishing it could last longer i know i did this movie did not feel short at all especially with the credits continuing the footage but i still wish it could've gone on forever now let's just wait and see when they release jackass number 3 overall an excellent film if you can get past the male nudity and a few sickening images keep your kids out of this film they don't need to see this at least until they are older support the crew and buy this when it comes out on dvd i know i will
<START> this movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie unhappy are not pleased with being out west so they hire a drunk wagon master john candy to lead them back east sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one and richard lewis gets on your nerves very quickly but then i honestly don't like him at anything he does ed lauter is hilarious as the bumbling villain br br the movie was dedicated to candy he died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed a stand in and digital enhancement enabled candy's character to be seen in the final scenes candy was a very good comedian and gave us some real good knee slapping belly laughs in his career this movie was just not the caliber of his best br br also in the film you will recognize william sanderson gailard sartain ethan phillips ellen greene and rodney a grant
<START> once upon a time in sweden there was a poor salvation army sister at death's door she requests send for david holm but victor as david holm cannot be located because he is spending new year's eve in a graveyard with his drinking buddies dying sister astrid holm as edit wants to see if praying for mr soul over the past year has produced any results arguably it has not in the graveyard tells the story of the phantom carriage which he heard from his dead friend tore as georges according to legend the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people until being relieved next new year's eve br br director whose lead performance is very strong combines with photographer julius to create a visually appealing film the great double exposure effect is used frequently but never seems overdone and it doesn't make the film's other dramatic highlights any less memorable for example tearing of his sewn coat and of the door a selma story probably wasn't one you could or would want to tamper with in the 1920s which may or may not be why the ending of this film is a letdown and unlike similar spiritual stories it's difficult to suspend your disbelief if you think too carefully about what is really happening in br br 1 1 21 victor victor hilda tore
<START> screenwriter steve sophomore effort following upon the wildly overpraised breaking away is a compendium of clichÃ©s coincidence and dour melodrama perhaps he lived some of this if so i'm sorry to say he was inexplicably unable to dramatize any of it convincingly br br in fairness he's not helped much here by arthur penn a talented director who's done remarkable work in the past bonnie and clyde little big man but fails to inject any energy or verisimilitude into narrative br br the cast struggles as best they can but are saddled with weak motivation and dialogue sympathies should be reserved particularly for craig wasson whose morose performance presages the impending quick fade of his leading man career as well as the embarrassingly untethered jodi miscast as the film's extremely unlikely 'femme fatale ' br br it all seems longer than it is and any points made are heavy handed and obvious see arthur penn's earlier take on the subject of the 60's the droll and elegiac alice's restaurant it's everything this one isn't
<START> i'm no director or writer or anything related to a movie but watching more than 1 movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not so here it is the quick and the undead is a rip off of the quick and the dead i was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it but oh no i was really in for an very big disappointment br br to put it simply the movie sucks i'm a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistent br br but i have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of squirm br br if you're a big fan of zombies watch this if you're not better look for other rob zombie films
<START> first of all the nature in the movie is beautiful and there is a bit of mongolian music well the horses looked mongolian and the camels but that's about all what was mongolian in it oh is played by a mongolian actress albeit a lame performance but she is pretty which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part br br but i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful to watch piece of 1 30 hour fantasy created by mr bodrov the plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion there was no logic behind the development of the plot in fact there was hardly any story at all just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in mongolian clothes speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like mongolian most actors were either japanese russian or chinese most scenes were shot in china kazakhstan or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a mongolian the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow the battle scenes are laughable all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story br br the japanese actor was like a wooden doll and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes he looked sleepy soft stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie br br and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste to see khan half of the movie as a slave to see his two first kids be born from other men to see his wife selling herself to the merchant my blood starts to boil and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between and one could make a great movie out of it where is the story of the rise of of his childhood of his relationship with his family with his brothers of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family where is van khan who helped him a lot where is the depiction of life in the of the life of the nomads of their traditions of their relations with the other nations around them br br where is development of the characters we totally fail to see what brought together with and what brought them apart and most important how became khan how he an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history all this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters but unfortunately we didn't see any of it in bodrov's creation not even a glimpse
<START> back in 1993 sega released a dull lackluster video game of one of the biggest films of all time quickly realizing their mistake they hashed out a different version of the game claiming it would be bigger tougher and better br br neither were both were slow boring games br br you can choose to be either dr alan grant or a raptor both have their problems why would dr grant go around killing all those army guys just what are they doing in the game and why a raptor be killing other raptors weird br br obviously not learning from their first mistake sega really dropped the ball on the original release and the so called rampage edition one of the slowest sluggish and dullest i have ever played
<START> i am a 58 year old man on a rainy afternoon my wife suggested that we go see the women after reading the reviews i thought it might lead to an afternoon nap wrong this movie held my interest from start to finish it was great to finally see meg ryan looking super again let's face it meg looks much better with long hair annette benning looked different to me in every scene she was in candice bergen is showing her age as is carrie fisher the daughter molly was exceptionally acted by young india i was able to understand the dialog which is tough in many current films due to rapid speech cloris leachman and the woman from finland were terrific as the housekeepers who extend their regular duties the nyc scenes were nice to see oh and bette midler had a short role but as usual was terrific so i gave this chick flick a 9 guys go see this even just for the eye candy like eva mendes it won't disappoint
<START> the box is one of the strangest movies i have ever seen to explain my experience let me use this word picture imagine that you have been on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but twilight zone reruns the resulting coma lands you in a hospital where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your iv the dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie br br summary a man shows up at the door of a couple he gives them a box with a button on it press the button they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they don't know will die i'll try not to spoil anything but from there things devolve into a plot so intertwined and complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity but hey most of us have been sane for a while now and change is good br br pros amazing storyline overall good acting not a slow moment once it gets going it asks questions of human morality that are rarely if ever asked in popular culture this movie is deep it has meaning its not summer blockbuster special effects fluff not that there's anything wrong with that this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places but i think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much br br cons the first twenty minutes before it gets going are really quite slow at the end of the movie you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour i can guarantee that this movie will not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics it is far too strange and there aren't explosions every three seconds in fact there are no explosions of any kind in this movie besides your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened personally i don't think this is a bad thing but many will br br rating easily a 9 10 i have never had an experience like watching this movie the only reason i can't give it a 10 10 is that it is just too wrapped up in itself there are several large things left unexplained at the end that are still bugging me as i sit here writing this but overall this is the best experience i have had in a movie theater in quite a long time but be warned you will not like this movie if you can't sit back turn on your suspension of disbelief to about 150 and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics br br visit www com for more reviews
<START> its very tough to portray a tagore novel along cinematographic lines and if you forget an obscure production of 1967 then its the first time that bali has been done on a grand scale overall the sets looked fantastic with the right touches for making a successful period drama so used to doing crass commercial stuff made a good effort i saw the version and found that voice was dubbed which made her dialog delivery a bit poor while the director did a good job portraying each of the characters with finesse yet there was very little in the way of meaningful plot probably a lack of the story itself however the development of the characters including those with minor roles seem to be the strongest point its tough to make some tagore stories into films as only the visual parts seem to get realized
<START> not all movies should have that predictable ending that we are all so use to and it's great to see movies with really unusual twists however with that said i was really disappointed in ending in my opinion the ending didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and it basically destroyed the story that was being told br br you spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the final 2 minutes of the movie would have impacted majorly on everyones character but the movie ends and leaves it all too wide open br br overall though this movie was very well made and unlike similar movies such as serendipity all the scenes were believable and didn't go over the top
<START> twins effect is a poor film in so many respects the only good element is that it doesn't take itself seriously other than that this is not really a movie but rather a merchandising tool for the film's two stars popular pop idols in their native hong kong br br the film itself is poorly constructed and acted the direction offers up some silly martial arts which is odd since the action director and supposedly co director is donnie yen like many hong kong films geared for the teen audience the major fanbase of actors like the twins the two girls who stars in this film and ekin cheng there is so much bad music to prod the audience into believing certain scenes are funny clever etc br br the final conclusion it's all for naught even as a fan of hong kong movies this is a poor film not funny enough not serious enough and just generally too bubble gum fake for its own good br br 3 out of 10 br br go to http www nixflix com for a more in depth review of this movie and other foreign films
<START> this isn't so bad it's good it's so bad it violates the geneva prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment only by reading the synopsis can you even figure out the plot of this straight to video disaster it's a hodge podge of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the all time worst acting you'll ever have the misfortune to see comparing this incompetent turgid humorless mess to dead men don't wear plaid is like saying that gigli is like citizen kane the talentless cast are costumed in cheap j c goin' to church clothes and there isn't the slightest attempt at period hairstyles or make up if you really want to see how this sort of homage can work check out the lost skeleton of cadavra it's clever well written and best of all performed by actual actors who aren't such agony to watch for that matter seek out the work of phoenix artist paul wilson whose sci fi short the attack of the 70 foot courtesy lady leaves this film in the dust the people in terror in the tropics look and sound like they were pulled off the street and given their scripts to read during the one and only take this is an insult to bela lugosi boris karloff lon chaney and anyone else involved in the films they cannibalized to make this schlock fest money isn't the problem a lot can be accomplished with very little expense a good script decent actors and above z grade costumes and production design should have been a given before the so called director created this stinky pile of cinematic offal let's hope the promise of a sequel doesn't come true that was by far the scariest thing shown in the whole movie
<START> what is it now a days that minority comedians feel its okay to slander their minority and expect to get away with it br br carlos mencia is no george lopez there is a difference when watching comedian carlos mencia i think he hates his own people and more than that i think he was forced to pattern his show as the hispanic latino spanish version of the dave show what a horrible mistake note to mencia please do not do a block party movie as much as i would like to see santana el christina jennifer lopez and the reunion of the cast of xica da silva on one stage don't br br carlos mencia likes to use the word as much as dave liked using the n word neither is funny and neither is acceptable even if it's from own people' carols mencia also likes to say if you're offended too bad it's not the offense it's the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted br br carols mencia goes further he everyone for what he assumes is comedy it's not comedy it's not funny there is a finesse to being able to look at yourself and make others laugh out of comedy and not laugh out of enforcing stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning br br mind of mencia needs polishing because carlos mencia needs polishing find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then do it until then the show mind of mencia is a pass
