<START> this movie is a quite fair adaptation of the prosper novel in the novel himself is a character don josÃ© is from north spain and historically a basque country zone they can speak basque language they are in seville andalusia south spain and they only speak spanish with andalusian accent in no way they speak basque but carmen explains to don josÃ© that she was living in you can believe it or not anyway this is the book's version then you can't be critical with the movie about this be with the book you have to note are different the novel by and the opera by bizet and this movie is an adaptation from the novel anyway in the opera don josÃ© is still spanish from never he's french why so many people keep thinking don josÃ© is french i don't know but i guess because the novel and the opera are in french although is supposed to be in spanish br br the only important difference between the movie and the novel is that in the movie don josÃ© also kills the torero lover of carmen and in the novel he doesn't neither in the opera i guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore i think the movie is quite good anyway
<START> there really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef kate armstrong catherine zeta jones whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece zoe abigail breslin after her sister is killed in a car wreck and that reason is to watch aaron nick who with his floppy haircut and appealingly laddish attitude looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic and eat with an olive oil and balsamic dip and a few finely diced sun dried tomatoes he reminds me of sean bean the thought that he might take his shirt off really was the only thing that kept me awake until the end he removed his apron petulantly several times but to my disappointment never went further br br i can't be too critical because i was watching it on pay per view at home so it hadn't cost me the price of two movie tickets at least and i was brought up to be grateful for small mercies but really this is rom com at its most formulaic zeta jones gives a very flat monotonous performance she seemed utterly lacking in passion possibly due to the amount of time she apparently spent in the cold store at the restaurant thirty takes in there can't have been fun and her face barely changed expression throughout the whole movie abigail breslin was pretty good as the niece she's such an appealing little girl that it's quite impossible to criticize her and anyway i loved her in little miss sunshine patricia clarkson is always good value and i can't really fault her performance as the restaurant owner because she seemed very underused given what a good actor she is and how little she had to do here but the whole thing is just so clichÃ©d much of the dialog banal and the outcome so obvious this is the cinematic equivalent of paint by numbers and zeta jones and generate little heat on screen br br nick likes italian food doubtless indicating his burning inner passion and cooks to the sound of his appearance in kate's kitchen at 22 the restaurant's name predictably her feathers but his uncanny ability to bond with her niece by cooking pizza and building a bedouin tent in the living room brings kate around and despite a few stumbles along the way she ends up giving him her prized possession no not her honour but her recipe for saffron sauce br br i'm being very unfair here aren't i i mean rom com is rom com and we all know what we are letting ourselves in for when we sign up but does it always have to be so mind numbingly dull
<START> linda blair has been acting for forty years now and while she will never escape the part of regan in the exorcist few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as witchery does she plays jane brooks a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase they are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents catherine hickland and rick farnsworth and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer david hasselhoff and his writer girlfriend leslie cumming who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch hildegard knef it seems that a long ago witch hunt resulted in her suicide and she was with child at the time unaware of the danger jane has recently dreamt of the witch's dramatic death and jane's little brother tommy michael manchester has been more directly visited by her spooky black clad spirit which he calls 'the lady in black' the group's time at the island inn begins quietly enough unknown to them however the lady in black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat george stevens before long the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the lady in black begins her reign of terror she plans to avenge her own fate by possessing jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse greed lust and the blood of a virgin as the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild she haunts them one by one in gruesome horrifying ways the island location is effectively scary and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot it's such a colorful film that it reminds me of dario argento's work the lighting is excellent and the set decoration is perfectly spooky the soundtrack is very effective and unique the horror effects are extreme terrifying and unforgettable the cinematography is great and it is this that brings us back to linda blair the creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot lots of dramatic push ins lingering close ups that subtly detail jane's possession and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films there are hidden homages to rosemary's baby jacob's ladder the shining black sunday and of course the exorcist she does a great job and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance that isn't to say that the rest of the cast disappoints catherine hickland is sexy and very good and veteran performer annie ross is memorable as jane's bitchy mother rose hasselhoff gives it his best but he is not essentially a film star and his television persona gets in the way of his performance blair and young michael manchester have a wonderful chemistry together the film is otherwise so violent and creepy in a good way that it desperately needs their warmth blair also played a mother in 2003's monster makers and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them lastly hildegard knef in one of her last roles plays a great witch and she has the most amazing voice and accent along with blair she was also perfectly cast but it's blair's movie all the way jane brooks also seems to have some psychic ability and this aspect of the film hearkens back to exorcist ii the heretic i think witchery is up there with the exorcist exorcist ii hell night and summer of fear as blair's best genre work to date
<START> i agree that mary woronov secretary is one of the only good things about this film she is my favorite actress ever every role she plays is always done so well her character is sly sarcastic clever light hearted funny and cunning she really pulls this role off well and you get a good feel for what her character is all about br br the rest of the movie is pretty bad the music is the most entertaining thing left one of the characters has this really strange circular radio that she brings with her while she wears her tight zebra striped tank top br br one thing that was a little intriguing about the story was the idea that someone hires these three college aged kids to spruce up an old abandoned theater he gives them the keys and says go at it that would be really fun and i wish someone would give me that chance imagine going into an old abandoned theater with two other people and you get to decide how to decorate it and fix it up you have total control over the whole building that would be so fun unfortunately the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure they think of it as a big chore they walk around with long faces and fight with each other the whole time it's kind of a bummer but it's fun to think about the possibilities that these people aren't even excited about br br the movie does a pretty good job at making you feel helpless or a little spooked out by the theater itself however the acting besides woronov and possibly murdoch the boss just because makes a really good money hungry fake smiley business man who never has any luck is really horrible and you just end up feeling unsatisfied plus the random slapstick is a little tacky and kind of ruins the reality that the film tries to create br br watch this if you dig mary woronov funky 80's casio keyboard style electronic beats and if you think having a giant spooky abandoned theater to yourself is at all intriguing
<START> in the new year's eve the sister of the salvation army edit astrid holm asks her mother and her colleague maria lisa to call david holm victor to visit her in her deathbed meanwhile the alcoholic david is telling to two other drunkards in the cemetery the legend of the phantom coach and his in accordance with the legend the last sinner to die in the turn of the new year becomes the soul collector gathering souls in his coach when david denies to visit edit his friends have an argument with him they fight and david dies when the arrives he recognizes his friend georges tore who died in the end of the last year george revisits parts of david's obnoxious life and in flashbacks he shows how mean and selfish david was br br is an impressive and stylish silent movie with magnificent special effects for a 1921 movie the characters are very well developed however the story is dated and there is a weird and unexplained situation when sister edit tells that she loves david holm why should a enlightened woman love such a despicable man that wasted his life corrupting other people despite being religiously dated in the present days it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption in the end my vote is nine br br title brazil a fantasma the phantom coach
<START> i was a little worried about actors and acting in italy then le and toni came it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen paolo has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years the movie is not completely perfect but di will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie toni please keep on acting in movies you're for sure the coolest actor around today and not just in italy his performance deserves international acclamation i rate this movie 9 10
<START> i thought nick look at the gritty streets of new jersey where car are at an all time high was both thought provoking and entertaining this is just as good as movies like boyz n the hood or menace ii society or above the rim i thought the actors and the scenarios were suitable it had a gritty realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric whether on purpose or by raw coincidence i liked this movie a lot an underrated gem i found on tv and glad i caught it go watch this movie if you get a shot if they don't have a dvd they should release one well done nick gomez imdb rating 5 9 my rating 9 10
<START> not everyone likes this movie it is still one of the best you have to be thinking movies about satanism ever made the fact that it doesn't have mtv era jump cuts or gore every seven minutes is irrelevant also speaking as someone who actually knows satanists the spoiler warning portion of the film where the brotherhood exchange their old bodies for those of preadolescent children it has some genuinely scary scenes the section where second spoiler alert martin orchestrates the changeover is almost hyper real in that it uses very few special effects a hallmark of this film was seldom given a big budget but was often effective it worked in this case too
<START> as most of you i've watch a lot of great movies in between those we often either voluntarily or mistakenly also find those movies that are so pointless that we think of reasons as to why anyone would make it this is exactly what i can say for dead man's bounty br br the very least i can do is try to warn some of you if you enjoy being entertained by a motion picture because of the story acting and intensity than you might want to chose something else now it's not all bad in fact if all you want is creative film editing and unique angles along with original music ambient than you might think it's ok as someone that values movie plots acting and being entertained by a film the truth is i thought this movie was so terrible beyond words i could easily find a spot for it on my list of worst movies seen in a while br br as for having val kilmer in this the truth is he was casted probably as a favor to the director as a fan of some of kilmer's films i can't understand what his motive for this was the movie seems part western part romance in the end i'm sure most of you can agree with me that it simply is a rude waste of our time in case you haven't seen this movie my recommendation would be to avoid it completely
<START> brass pictures movies is not a fitting word for them really are somewhat brassy their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class tv commercials but unfortunately brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours in this they fail miserably their undeniable but rather soft and flabby than steamy erotic qualities non withstanding br br senso '45 is a remake of a film by luchino visconti with the same title and alida valli and farley granger in the lead the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around venice during the italian wars of independence brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century 1945 to be exact so there are mussolini murals men in black shirts german uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans but it is just window dressing the historic context is completely negligible br br anna plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral ss guy who always puts on too much lipstick she is an attractive versatile well trained italian actress and clearly above the material her wide range of facial expressions signalling boredom loathing delight fear hate and ecstasy are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars she endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity i wish some really good parts come along for her she really deserves it
<START> before watching this film at a screening attended by the director herself we were informed this had won the short film prize at the film fleadh surely this result will give filmmakers hope anyone can do better than this br br how anyone cannot notice the flagrant rip off of donnie darko in this i'll never know the film is pure drivel the acting cardboard the dialogue ridiculous the ending just flat the only of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this rubbish was to loudly comment on how dreadful it was in front of the director yes that was mean but liberating br br at least irish film making can't sink any lower
<START> wow this is anti christian bias big time this is based on a stephen king novel and he written this kind of bias before and then hollywood exaggerates it even more in this film we see a protestant minister and a catholic priest both act like fools and be profane at the same time of course the devil has taken over the town so maybe his influence is into these guys too but they are typical hollywood portrayals they never show a minister who talks and acts like billy graham or your local minister or priest and another given they make the satan character the most interesting of the film br br max von sydow plays the devil and makes him a likable guy ironically von sydow has played a number of these roles after portraying jesus in the 1964 film the greatest story ever told you wonder why actors are so screwed up they don't know if they are god satan or anyone in between br br ed harris who played a lot of unlikeable roles up until the last few years is appropriately cast in this story he and the rest of the mean spirited characters in this film do not make it fun to watch br br from what i've heard king's book is even darker and more sick than this hate filled movie but better constructed frankly who cares king and hollywood deserve each other
<START> i can never fathom why people take time to review movies that they have not understood fully i know people will read scathing reviews on these pages of this film and it will keep them from seeking copies of this quite forgotten late '20s style but 1932 movie which should probably be referred to as indecent as that is the name on the main titles br br myrna loy best known as a comic actress in countless genteel roles shows herself to be miscast in all of them she was a true dramatic actress something that i did not know before watching this film which predates all of her famous roles she is exciting and moving here two things she never was opposite the graceful and refined william powell i'm still rather in shock over how good she was br br becky sharp 1935 the first three strip technicolor feature is more familiar but this one is far better artistically and an adaptation it is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die you cannot take my word for it you must see it
<START> i was excited about this movie after reading other reviews what a disappointment there are so many ways that this movie is bad the computer graphics were lacking to say the least i found the acting stiff and unbelievable watch the sand as the lost e pods what an original name are found where did all the tracks come from i immediately recognized portions similar to other movies ie alien pitch black come on one huge ship to transport one prisoner and what is with the prisoner does he speak can he speak i kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together but it never came if this movie was made on a low budget it shows the only part of the movie i liked was when it finally ended i don't mean that i liked the ending i didn't i just liked the fact that it was over a trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable in my opinion don't waste your time on this one
<START> well horror this ain't but a terrible low low budget backwood flic of the worst kind sort of and therefore quite charming and funny to watch at least on my tv set a cross between pete walker herschell gordon lewis and say damn i give up just can't come up with any prettier resemblances for this trashy movie everything is soooo wrong that i just have to enlist it in my film collection alongside with death in venice nekromantik blue velvet and the good bad ugly right people with some small talent for adding gory inserts or sexy happenings to film they buy other people should pick this film up immediately sure is a fat lil' ol' goldmine waiting here oh
