<START> a good but not great film the great dictator is chaplin's first talkie it's a good effort and at times a remarkable satire on hitler but unfortunately the moments of chaplin brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue yes chaplin the silent screen master just uses too many words in this film and his tendency towards writing long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue would carry over into his other talkie films such as better limelight still chaplin was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly memorable goddard doesn't have the glow she did in modern times her off screen affair with chaplin was cooling at the time but she is always worth seeing and jack oakie just about steals the show as a rival dictator to chaplin's famous creation
<START> this film is basically a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little kid could have written it not much suspense it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film at the beginning when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something whats up with that the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a beatles concert even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy don't waste your time with this nuff said
<START> this is horrible film it is past dumb first the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what boys like them they are in 7th grade not to say i am a prude or anything but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages being pretty and popular is not everything but that is what the twins make it out to be the plot is even worse the girl's grandpa just happens to be the sp to france he has a co worker take the girls around paris and they meet two cute french boys with motorcycles they sneek out to meet the boys start to really like them etc they meet a supermodel in process and go around paris with total strangers they think are cute need i say more this movie may be cute to 8 9 year olds the twins play ditsy losers that want boyfriends it makes sends the wrong idea to girls the film itself is not great either i don't recomend this to anyone i give passport to paris 2 10
<START> my favourite story from 'tales from the crypt' brion jones was born to play the part of the maniac lumberjack axe swinging madman steve dixon having seen him before in tango cash i can state this actor never got the proper credit he deserved a jealous husband takes offence in his wife showing an interest in a hunky young worker he's just employed and you know when dixon finds out there's gonna be hell to pay the young worker ted billy wirth receives an almighty beating from dixon leaving him blind now how is a blind lumberjack supposed to work a tribute to black humour if there ever was one the co stars do a pretty good job too supporting ted when dixon when he has his initial suspicions about his wife desiring another man dixon's behaviour making the bond stronger closer between the colleagues one even stated he became a changed man when he got married though ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could
<START> city streets is amazingly modern technically speaking for a movie made in 1931 also who could not be mesmerized enthralled by gary cooper's powerful magnetism galvanizing the audience attention the plot is quite elaborate and clear the scenarios decor are exceptional in every detail all the actors are above average i keep guessing how the director and his staff including editing sound lighting photography could have been so brilliant i couldn't find a flaw understanding that the scenes in the road bumpy ride with the large motion pictures screen on the background was the best they could get in 1931 all in all i found this movie superb and so much alive thanks to gary cooper charisma
<START> if you liked the richard chamberlain version of the bourne identity then you will like this too aiden quinn does this one brilliantly you can't help but wonder if he is really out there i reckon he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it's so intense when i first saw it i was just flicking channels on the remote late one evening i got hooked within minutes look up www answers com for ramÃ­rez sÃ¡nchez who is the character that carlos the is based on for both i remember reading about ramÃ­rez arrest in the paper in 1997 it was front page for weeks through the trial after his arrest
<START> this little film brings back a lot of memories both fond and foul of what can and does happen when one is a working musician the not so pleasant accommodations for the band the management of the venue jumping up and down telling you what to play the sheer ecstasy of the applause far from being farcical it is in fact very accurate in the way it depicts musicians professional and otherwise who have travelled a great distance to perform a season of gigs at a venue there are those times when everything goes perfectly there are those other times when you immediately start to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing this far from home in the end you have to make the best of it because there is no other way out
<START> how many disaster movies can there be before we get tired of them come on we can see them on the discovery channel all day long br br i agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera the great grandson makes a prediction and everybody starts moaning about how he is ruining the family name the evil mother in law convinces the wife to throw him out into the arms of his mistress whom she wants to meet can you believe that the wife wants to approve the new wife at the same time the has someone in love with her that doesn't have a wife but she sends him packing br br now that the soap opera is over the earthquake appears br br the special effects are really good but the dubbing is bad that is why i like subtitled films the actors are all very experienced and have won many awards so you will get to see some of japan's best in an oft repeated story br br but the soap opera story returns with a kitchy ending
<START> six shooter tunnel sergeant dr death pinhead cyclops and blade help the young andre toulon take out egyption henchman in the best sequel this series has seen br br retro puppet master is atmospheric with many sets quality acting and some fun puppet fx what it lacks in gore it makes up for with an interesting well paced plot br br best quote dr death don't you know my friends smell the sulfur see the smoke br br this is easily the best dave decoteau film i've seen the actors do a more than credible job jack donner as turns in an inspired performance and the young toulon does well with the puppets oh and the ring needle is cool br br john score is a nice symphonic take on the original puppet master tunes by richard band keeping the movie playful and eerie it's rare for a full moon score to actually add something to a film and this one does br br unfortunately dave allen didn't seem to be affordable enough for band and co in the late 90's and beyond so all of the puppet action is done rod and string there's no stop motion such as the famous and funny scene in the original where looking for his pinhead and of course as with all of the full moon fare of this time period rpm was shot in and around castel studios in bucharest so most of the bit parts were cast to romanians hearing their parisian accents was a bit annoying br br all in all this is probably one of the top 10 full moon films it's certainly the most inventive of the puppet master sequels
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen it's supposed to be a remake or update of the one armed swordsman by chang cheh the ham fisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes aren't even worth watching the script tries desperately hard to seem serious but is full of cliches like and i knew then that nothing would ever be the same again or if only i'd known what a heavy price i would have to pay ugh and who is that girl who plays sing someone find her and have her eliminated she's awful if you like chinese martial arts movies you'd be better off with lau gar leung this stinks
<START> br br first of all i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed the la punks br br i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in finland br br so if you don't like this kind of music why you write here about it i like this kind of music it speaks my soul thus i know punks from all over europe americas so why do you who find this music repugnant care to comment at all br br
<START> a giant praying mantis is awakened from its sleep in the artic region and heads south causing havoc boats planes and trains meet their match with the flying creature before unleashing its full wrath on nyc the mantis meets its doom at the hands of the armed forces in a new york tunnel the special effects are of course crude by todays standards but for a ten year old boy in 1957 this was very memorable br br starring are william hopper craig stevens alix and pat conway
<START> seagal was way off the mark with this film i'm a fan of his and come to expect cool fight scenes and sharp one liners but this film had none of this instead it had injections and cheesy music even if you're a fan of his i strongly recommend you keep away from this film and watch under siege or even on deadly ground instead
<START> this late ish effort from plays as a modern day 70's that is gothic thriller but comes out short of thrills certainly it's not a dreadfully bad film it's jut got that feeling which many of later films have of someone who has given up when he's seen the first it starts out good enough almost giallo like in tone then takes a turn into gothic territories with a decent albeit terribly clichÃ© set up then suddenly seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get is prolonged shots of camille keaton and burning candles then circa an hour into the film we get some sort of violent climax with decent to poor special effects this is followed by a slow paced with a very obvious twist ending if it's even intended to be a twist and throw a few very halfhearted explanatory scenes along the way and you got tragic ceremony thus in parts it's got its qualities but then suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you a pity br br btw stay away from the dvd a useless murky pan scan edition which kills of what could be a good visual experience
<START> what is it about drug addiction that so draws first time filmmakers to offer their own take on the subject this subject has been done to death drug abuse is bad we get it drug addiction is painful to watch we get that too but the bleak subject matter doesn't give the filmmaker license to make a sloppy film every film need not be hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence or use orson wellesian deep focus but it's still a narrative movie verite does not mean pseudo documentary even consumer mini dv cameras are capable of producing white whites and black blacks and this filmmaker is just being lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting the subject is bleak enough without artificially forcing it with sloppy cinematography and even documentary films have a sound mix vera farmiga is very talented given the right material but the director obviously over directed her and sucked all the life out of her performance addicts may live in a fog but they still have emotions but none of these characters seem to exist off screen the supporting players merely delivered their lines without creating real people sorry to be so harsh debra but some things are true whether want to believe them or not i'm sure your next film will be better but please not another drug movie
