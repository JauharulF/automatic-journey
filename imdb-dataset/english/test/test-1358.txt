<START> i just saw this early this morning on the fox channel quite by accident my dog woke me up i had seen it years ago and thought i remembered it fairly well as a kid i had enjoyed it but now as another poster commented several of the reels were out of order and while it was disorienting at first and bizarre it seemed to fit the production what was just awful became surreal and amusing musical numbers for what i think was the big fundraiser show you're in show business i'm in show business most of the kids are in show business let's put on a show come out of nowhere before all the talk about putting on a show and then fade without applause to totally unrelated straight scenes the leading man's girlfriend shows up spits out lines and lines of dialogue then disappears i was half awake and loved every insane minute of it
<START> three of the things you can say about spalding gray are he certainly marched to the beat of his own drummer he was never at a loss for words and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life experiences and thoughts no matter how trivial at times br br most of us are not quite as far off the wall as he was most of us aren't as interested in sharing the most minute parts of ourselves with others even one on one or in small groups let alone on stage br br but that doesn't make it any less interesting to watch and listen to this erudite unusual man and after seeing one of his performances on reflection we can find many of his articulate musings were perhaps more relevant to our own lives and thoughts than we may have first thought br br granted he was a new york avant garde type of personality and undeniably a bit strange there are those who would maintain describing someone as new york and strange was being unnecessarily redundant br br i give him a 10 for the talent he presents in this genre which is his specialty
<START> an american werewolf in london had some funny parts but this one isn't so good the computer werewolves are just awful the perspective is all off it's like seeing them through a distorting mirror the writers step on the throat of many of their gags american boy says to parisian girl is there a around here instead of just leaving it at that they have to have the girl sigh and respond this is paris
<START> 83 minutes nope this thing is 72 minutes tops br br if you cannot guess the killer in this movie you had better throw your tv out the window because you ain't learned nothing in 20 years of cinematic slasher history br br and how come the plain star who never gets naked is always the one you want to get naked
<START> insanely well crafted mini series br br i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american playhouse on pbs was heavily promoted at the time i believe it might have been one of the very early mini series showing on pbs outside of the masterpiece theater series br br the full length production was shown i believe only once during its first broadcast was 6 8 hours total this length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours cut some interesting but slow scenes br br i am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete not edited version to dvd not worth creating a vhs version at this point br br would fit in very well in the mini series or dramatic history genre
<START> two escaped convicts step out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head that's the first scene and it made me wince fearing what was in store but by the end of the first half hour i was all swept up in the flood of images not because i cared in the least about any of the characters but because i was aghast at how execrable the film was and was curious to see how truly low it could sink br br frank remar and red are the ex inmates after murdering the two innocent campers they plow through the woods and wangle their way into the isolated cabin of dean stockwell and his two sons the attorney keith and the estranged homosexual behr the escapees at first pretend their car has broken down and they need to use the phone but they gradually reveal their identities br br well it looks like familiar territory so far desperate hours or funny games maybe but hang on the gay son is in cahoots with the two it seems that stockwell upon discovering his son in flagrante delicto with another man named billy kicked billy around and threw him out billy went on to die and behr now blames his dad for the death and indeed dad is something of a neanderthal when it comes to the fact that he was just found cohabiting with a secretary notwithstanding br br the grief stricken behr just searched and searched looking for someone else who had known billy someone with whom he could share his despair it turned out to be one of the escapees and now behr is determined to see them to their freedom br br it gets all twisted after that people talk they talk and talk they talk continually and not about the two mad killers who just can't wait to put one between their eyes no the dialog goes something like you were just so scared of something inside yourself that you even drove away your own son that's behr the young gay guy talking to stockwell it's as if an afternoon domestic drama had had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in some kind of transformational device or cocktail shaker br br the only real performance is given by james remar as the more talkative and ominous of the two escapees and that's mainly because of his gruff but fluid baritone which sounds like lance and his wide guppy like lips he's easy on the eyes and ears br br dean stockwell has given decent performances including his bizarro turn in blue velvet in which he was my supporting player but here laziness advancing years or slack direction has shaped his every move and every utterance into a stereotype it's as if he were reading stage directions look surprised and shout angrily and following them literally there's not a surprise in a br br if the gay son jason behr ever blinked it must have been while i was blinking at the same time because i missed it he has a long neck and just one expression in his instrument as the secondary villain fades into the pine knot paneled woodwork the attorney son is robert glen keith i hope he didn't quit his day job br br the direction is pedestrian the staging functional without being in the least innovative sometimes it's confusing i lost track of where everyone was supposed to be as the killers are circling around on the porch and the family has locked itself inside with a shotgun i also couldn't understand how stockwell could put a blast through the door hit remar and knock him in a back flip off the porch and then remar could simply stand up dust himself off and come up with a cranky riposte like okay two can play that game but why go on see it if you must
<START> like many i first saw the water babies as a child young teen in the late seventies early eighties it has remained with me since then with its catchy tunes memorable portrayals less then successful animation and a story full of heart coldness and ultimately good vanquishing evil recently i sat down and saw it again after at least two decades passing and i noticed this time around its striking similarities to the wizard of oz no these aren't blatant but hear me out in this one we have a boy and his dog having personal problems at home running away from something and in the scene right after they run away changing the substance of their appearance in this one the boy and dog become animated in the wizard of oz dorothy and toto are in color in this one the boy and dog are told they must find the water babies for answers and then ultimately the for guidance and he has the ability to let tom go home if he shows he has courage etc in the wizard of oz dorothy must also find an authoritative figure that tests her before he will allow her to return home in the water babies tom meets three characters that will help him on his journey to the water babies dorothy has three helpers as well when each helper is met we are entertained with a rendering of hi hi hi hi hi we're on our way in the wizard it is we're off to see the wizard dorothy has a good witch sort of look after her tom has a woman with many roles billie whitelaw do the same if you look closely at the two there are many other that being said the water babies is not a knockoff in any way i was just commenting on the eerie likes between the two this film has some solid performances from bad guys bernard cribbins and the always fascinating james mason the kids playing tom and ella are good the supporting cast of joan greenwood love her voice david tomlinson and the vocal talents of john pertwee and lance percival add greatly to the mix i must confess that the animation is less than sterling even for its time but is adequate enough to the challenge the three animated characters that help tom get home are all likable i always have trouble picking my favorite between the french swordfish and the john mr humphries like the scene where we hear this guttural maniacal laugh from a shipwrecked vessel only to see a with a huge polka dotted bow tie bob out always has me rolling the water babies is a lot of fun sure it is more of a children's film but it has and always shall have a fond place in my heart the bulk of the credit for what successes the film does have must go to director lionel jeffries jeffries is a wonderful comedic actor and his sense of humor is clearly evident throughout
<START> as an avid cinema go er i felt that whilst i was ranking my favourite movies i felt it only fair to rank my most hated films br br i'm afraid i really have nothing positive to say about this movie it is in fact one of only two films that i have ever walked out on in fairness i went back and watched the movie again to give it another chance and sat through it only to wish that i should have stayed away br br the sad thing is the movie has a really decent cast and crew but then even the brightest stars in hollywood cant bring a dead duck of a script to life br br stay away save yourself from this truly woeful 'film' 1 10
<START> my first question is not about the horrible acting not about the horrendous writing it is the directing the choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions i have ever seen why does every single bad guy have to die in slow motion i was about to beat myself with a rubber hose the camera shots make it so that you can't see whats going on i was just about to turn the movie off because of jalal accent when it made it to the sex scene so i thought it might get better well it did not if you rate special effects on an a b c rating scale i would have to put it around a w or so and did i mention the acting wow was it bad and the worst part of the entire expect to die experience is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover which is the matrix just got deadlier comparing this movie to the matrix is easily the worst comparison i have ever seen if you haven't seen this movie don't unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall
<START> i had to see this on the british airways plane it was terribly bad acting and a dumb story not even a kid would enjoy this something to switch off if possible
<START> the movie is apparently based on a popular french horror novel by arthur from 1927 not that i had ever heard about it before but has been a popular subject before for movies and mini series the first movie got released way back in 1927 simultaneously with the novel arthur was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously the character is one of his best known creations br br once upon a time sophie was a promising new european actress who would conquer hollywood she has now however dropped back again to movies like this one nothing wrong with playing in french quality movies since it's the country she originates from but this movie is just ridicules br br problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects to make the movie good and scary well horror and special effects never really have been a good combination though with some exceptions here and there it's not like the special effects are bad in this one especially for an european movie it is simply good but it s just misplaced since the movie gave the feeling it could had easily done without its effect it would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch no doubt about that really br br the movie is just not ever tense or engaging to watch also since the movie seems to have difficulties picking the right approach at times the movie picks a light and just less serious approach while at others it clearly attempts to be a good scary horror movie this is mostly the reason why the movie just doesn't work out on any level you can say that the movie is even a bit boring it all also definitely gets worse toward the ending after a while you just stop caring about this movie and its story and you start wishing you had decided to watch something else instead br br the editing seems totally off it uses too fast cuts without much style while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the movie a good modern style also the time line is just plain messed up at times as if some sequences got edited in the wrong order br br the musical score is also really annoying and at times doesn't even sounds to fit the movie as if it all long got scored before the movie finished shooting i can't believe composer bruno coulais is an oscar nominated composer the musical score is almost just as annoying as the movie its sound effects br br the movie is filled with many characters which you however just couldn't care less about it also just seems very unlikely that a woman like sophie would ever fall for a man such as the movie also features julie christie which is nice but just doesn't add much to the movie br br a horrible watch br br 3 10
<START> warning if the coen brothers or david lynch define your taste in film disregard this review and move on br br yes i borrowed the one line summary from the book about president ronald reagan but among other virtues this movie emphasizes the role that character plays in the lives of honorable human beings this film is full of honest decent people and they have integrity to spare in a word they have character br br a small nitpick unless you know the history of ww ii you probably don't know that from captain correlli's arrival on the island to the fall of mussolini 3 and one half years have passed the average viewer might think the romance was of the whirlwind variety that is not so the romance develops slowly which gives it both dignity and meaning the film's deliberate pace may be the director's way of marking time br br some reviews have criticized cage's italian accent the italian speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is quite good br br the history was right on the mark yes the germans turned against their italian allies who for the most part were reluctant allies from the start if you find that shocking keep in mind that the french mediterranean fleet was blown up by the british in 1940 just after france's capitulation lest it fall in the hands of the vichy government or worse the nazis br br the depiction of the italians as educated and cultured was a compliment to an educated and cultured civilization br br this film was beautifully photographed and its story was lyrical the script was not thought provoking nor was it clever but here was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not needed nor would they have been appropriate br br the story is tender and the message is uplifting the characters are honest brave earnest sympathetic and likeable it's a nice little film 8 10 br br br br
<START> the performances rate better than the rating i've given this work simply because i will not support a movie which shows any child or mentally challenged person how to obtain cook and inject narcotics into their bodies br br this is a disgusting film which serves no purpose in the world but to glamorize and attempt to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle it bears convincing performances which add to my disgust what were these people thinking i could not enjoy a movie such as this it's enough to make someone who has never done drugs think about it and those who have and have redeemed themselves consider reversion i'm surprised it doesn't make every clean junkie who sees it fall off the wagon br br there's nothing good about this movie which stands more as a how to get strung out docu drama this is the epitome of what's wrong with hollywood br br utterly disgusting br br it rates a 1 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i do think tom hanks is a good actor i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little i was very disappointed in the movie one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard there is a totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene there are some characters and scenes that seem scary for little children for whom this movie was made the north pole scenes with santa and the elves could have been cute and charming there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters it usually doesn't work to make a short children's book into a feature film this movie totally grates on my nerves
<START> if you have seen this movie then you will know that it is one of the worst bollywood movies ever made bollywood is known to copy hollywood movies who would of known that they will copy terminator 2 the difference between both film industries are hollywood spends millions and bollywood spends 100 thousands average thats the problem with this film if you want to make a t2 style movie then do it properly the director added a bogus fantasy storyline about a reincarnated snake who finds his long lost girl in the previous birth dead by 2 guys but the blame goes to 10 people she suddenly reincarnates into a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for her death not to mention the reincarnated snake guy or villain has some kind of super powers he can transform into anything he can fly disappear fire power wind power you name it he has it he even gets and survives the style you are probably wondering how he survives its best not to ask and its best not to waste time and money on this movie its best just to forget this film even came out i think its a shame to use a big for this outrageous movie with a nonsense storyline
