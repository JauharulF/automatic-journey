<START> going into teaching mrs tingle all i wanted was a fun enjoyable teen comedy that would entertain me for it's running time despite a rather good first half hour the film quickly subsides into a dull clichÃ©d mess that's about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers rusty pliers at that 'scream' writer kevin williamson wrote and directed this movie and proved that scream may well have been a fluke most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films and while it was ok for him to steal elements from other movies in scream due to the fact that it's meant as a slasher tribute here it just looks like he's completely ran out of ideas the plot follows the cleverest girl in school played by katie holmes after being caught cheating along with two of her friends the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home however this isn't just any teacher it's mrs tingle the meanest bitch in school she isn't taking being tied to the bed lying down either as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other br br the plot is very similar to the 1997 flick 'suicide kings' and a whole host of earlier films it's actually not a bad idea for a movie and if williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters it could have worked really well the character of mrs tingle is the most interesting in the movie but she's massively one dimensional and like all the other characters in the film is merely a caricature the acting is largely diabolical with the exception of helen mirren in the title role she's suitably evil in the role and while she doesn't have a lot to get her teeth into she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure the teenage cast isn't worth mentioning with only katie holmes standing out and that's only really because of her star profile not her acting talents williamson has draped nearly every scene in dull soft rock music which would be really annoying if the film wasn't absolutely terrible anyway honestly this movie does have a few moments that are rather good but basically if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy this isn't the movie that you want to see
<START> there was once someone in my family not saying who it is because of personal reasons who thinks that mr bean is always so silly in whatever he does on the comedy series imagine how i felt at that time shocked instantly br br there are more reasons than one why i love watching mr bean being one of those earliest shows on the local television here in my country where i first grew up watching it's just one of those things which had stuck into my head there was even once my friends and i talked about few of the selected episodes and we just laughed together br br it's always silly funny and hilarious in whatever antics rowan atkinson as mr bean will do in each episode though lately at times it may show some of the repeats here it never failed to bring back those childhood memories of mine in fact i can dare say this is the very first show which introduces me about the kind of shows which come out of the uk as i was growing up br br the comedy series definitely really wicked as what the brits may be saying
<START> the movie and the earth did not swallow him based on the book by tomas rivera is an eye opening movie for most people it talks about the exploitation that migrant go through in order to survive br br sergio perez uses impressionistic techniques to depict rivera's story he uses sienna and gray scale effects to depict some of the scenes and he uses specific photographic techniques to make the scenes look like they took place in the 1950s br br perez also gives life to the film by using time appropriate music including and guitar playing br br i feel that it is a good film to view because it shows in detail how migrant live what they do for entertainment and their beliefs
<START> i love sarah plain and tall winters end its such a good movie it tells of the hardships of living on a farm i live on a farm so i know what its like to have hardships br br i love the setting in kansas its such a beautiful place my favorite country star is from kansas i love the country in kansas its just so beautiful i would love to live in kansas br br sarah plain and tall winters end i think is a love story i love love stories they are so fun to watch i like to watch them because it is nice to watch people fall in love falling in love is not as hard as most people think i've fallen in love once sarah plain and tall winters end is my favorite love story
<START> when i first saw this dvd in a bargain bin for three dollars i really couldn't believe my luck a christmas movie starring tori spelling william shatner and gary coleman needless to say i snatched it up immediately and considered it a worthwhile investment br br the movie itself was just as bad as any movie you'd expect to be combining christmas and the three aforementioned celebrities the dialogue was inane the characters were one dimensional and carol's character arc was completely unbelievable the movie itself was a lifeless piece of boring that refused to end and made me feel used as a human being when the end did finally come br br my advice don't watch this movie unless you have to and then only under the influence of some serious holiday eggnog
<START> this movie is based on the novel island of dr moreau by h g wells it's a fairly good one too it's at least better than the version by john frankenheimer
<START> war is in your blood rambo says early in the film don't fight it say what is the scriptwriter taking the mickey out of sly it is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here yet stallone utters it without a hint of irony br br the same lack of humour applies to the movie rambo iv is an over the top idiotic actioner that would have been funny without intention if it weren't sickeningly violent a redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so villainous it is not enough just to kill them Â you have to dismember them with relish stallone stops at no blue collar clichÃ© to make his point it is not enough for the chief villain to be feed them to the pigs throw babies into fire kind of sadist he is also a pedophile homosexual br br what is happening to imdb is it taken over by the rifle society how can this loathsome excuse for gross exploitation rate that high i like a good action movie as much as the next man but this is not entertainment Â this is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of the only good thing about the movie is that sly doesn't take his shirt off for this i will give it one star
<START> the essence of this film falls on judgments by police officers who fortunately ethical and moral men act on situations within situations in a city with a super abundance of violence and killing good compound interacting story lines and above average characterizations
<START> for this movie based off of a tv show and a serious finale i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious 'm a s h goodbye farewell and was pretty good but not this one unless you really love the series like myself skip this movie br br i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens but the plot was too gimmicky and dave coulier man that guy hasn't done anything good well ever they shouldn't have used tim meadows he's a great actor but he was too good for the script br br i thought the movie was pure cheese i would give it a 4 5 10
<START> i do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it it's one of the best teenager horror films i've ever seen and that's saying a lot nothing is left without an explanation to back it up the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately a clear example is the mindless saint ange the first 30 40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted after the arrival to the village though the horror a different twisted kind of horror begins br br with the plot and the details goofs are minor the characters are this movie's strongest point given that so many clichÃ©s are broken in it for example the two main male characters nick and wade are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to although dalton might fit better in this stereotype not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness some scenes are truly satisfyingly horrible making up for tense moments scattered around all the film and in the end and although everything is explained it's easy to see that things won't go so easy to the surviving characters br br the only errors i can see and which do not imply continuity ie carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious bo's pockets is the illumination which is somehow annoying during the first boring 30 minutes although plot and effects wise everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to that little village in the midst of nothing so i'll give it that it's been pretty much argued that about 70 of the movie is illogical how can two people build an entire house of wax where do they get all the wax from these wouldn't be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie the sinclair brothers did not build the house of wax their mother worked making actual wax figures and they were exhibited at the museum and the scenario where paris hilton's unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question what is with all the personal objects mobile phones cars clothes of the dead people using their third brother as a connection with the exterior it's pretty much arguable that the sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax in a wwii type fashion br br so that aside i think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets and nobody should lose the chance to watch it so go see the house of wax right now
<START> i was watching an nfl game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the hbo type channels i missed the beginning but when i started watching deadly voyage the was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled you will find yourself rooting against the and on the edge of your la z boy throughout this one if you get the chance take the time to watch it every once in a while i think about having the cable company take off my movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them happy holidays to all from cape cod
<START> love life explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man i found the subject matter compelling even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved for example thomas falls for joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joe's glasses the one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene in the end i found myself more turned on by this movie than moved stephan d gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with skill and exuberance and all too often acting chops to match many times the movie seems like it is going to go full on porn stephanie does a fine job but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a bit for me since i was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie
<START> okay i'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler so i just ticked the box anyway to save the hassle br br i've noticed that the opinions on this film seem to be a fair split personally i loved it although i must say that i think that some of the cameo's were there for the sake of having a cameo peter kay personally i am just thankful that it wasn't the edward tubbs and papa show and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to headline the motion picture especially sir tipps arguably the funniest of the bunch br br actually this is less of a summary more of a fairly obtuse blog like thing but what the hell the film was awesome and i guess that's all that counts
<START> there's an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie it's just a brainless comedy don't take it seriously dude well that's one point of view the other would be why are we accepting exactly the same script the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these comedies br br what you get is a slacker who through some totally unreal circumstances has to change his life always a he overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more money self esteem on the way somebody does something gross but very illogical this means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like you won't believe it this guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative then he shines his shoes with it hilarious br br most of the usual names turn up david spade and rob schneider do unfunny shtick but they're characters a russian and i'm holding my sides a waiter in a vegan restaurant adam sandler the king of the brainless unfunny illogical comedy co produces and some talentless nobody called dante shows up yet again the us will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy dante is famous for cos we are clueless allen covert plays a 36 year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me he was 42 and looked years older br br did i laugh yes but no more than i would at a tv sit com and i don't have to pay a penny to watch them please stop making these movies
<START> this movie attempted to make stu life interesting by being creative what they forgot is that his life was plenty entertaining enough on it's own without having to make things up br br a short list of the inaccuracies br br 1 was not sent straight to las vegas for a gin tournament to pay off old debts he spent a good deal of time in florida first and only went to las vegas when he ran out of gin games on the east coast br br 2 never associated or played gin with a casino executive like the one played by pat morita in the movie br br 3 there was no magical turnaround in the buildup to the 1997 in fact barely made it into the tournament as it was he cocaine the week before even br br either tell the story right or don't tell it at all 4 out of 10 stars for michael credible performance the only redeeming quality of this movie
