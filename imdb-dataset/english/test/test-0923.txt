<START> 's reputation preceded it i first heard of it in one of those medved style movie books the 50 worst movies ever or the golden turkey awards or something like that every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it so when the exposed film society finally got around to showing it i was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide br br however robot wasn't really all that bad br br oh this is definitely a z film through and through some of the voice dubbing as is usually the case for k gordon murray imports is awfully cheesy and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a frankenstein since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous aztec mummy movie narrated with a voice over by the leading man a dead giveaway anytime the question then what happened is asked more than twice in the dialog you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum in then what happened or what happened then is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour br br even without the structural problems the plot and dialog don't translate well to an older american audience for instance as the hero explains and explains and explains the back story he includes a remark about doctor a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal and began his quest for the treasure that the aztec mummy guards no background no explanation he just suddenly turned evil obviously this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audience br br the clincher though is the robot the supposed showcase of this movie this robot is the worst robot special effect since undersea kingdom or even santa claus vs the martians compared to this hunk of junk the tin man from the wizard of oz looked like the terminator that chased linda connor through the in t2 the aztec mummy himself is well designed and executed he's recognizably undead familiar enough to look like a mummy and yet distinct from the boris karloff bandage collection familiar to most american audiences but whoever designed the robot in this followup had no feel for the concept or no budget they could at least have given him some knees for heaven's sake br br in addition the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds i've seen shoving matches on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing then the movie basically just stops that seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itself br br in spite of all these problems the movie isn't horrible or incompetent the way a coleman francis film or a larry buchanan film was compared to monster a go go or attack of the eye creatures is like a coppola film it's just kind of dull and boring and silly the actors are competent in a mannered b movie way and reasonably photogenic dr in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and phantom of the opera suit i often found myself rooting for him in spite of his being the villain br br anyway i've seen much much worse file this with samson vs the vampire women under interesting mexican juvenile oddities
<START> well i fear that my review of this special won't heed much different observation than the others before me but i literally just watched it during a pbs membership drive and frankly i'm too excited not to say anything to really appreciate the enigma that is barbra streisand you have to look back before the movies before the broadway phenomenon of the mid 60's when television was still a young medium there was a form of entertainment very prominent on the air that is but a memory today musical variety some musical shows were weekly series but others were single one time specials usually showcasing the special talent of the individual performer this is where we get the raw uninhibited first looks at streisand she had already been a guest performer on other variety shows including garry moore ed sullivan and scored a major coup in a one time only tandem appearance with the woman who would pass her the baton of belter extraordinary judy garland in 1966 color me barbra introduced barbra streisand in color hence the title but copied the format of her first special a year earlier almost to the letter in 3 distinct acts we get an abstract streisand in an after hours art museum looking at and sometimes becoming the works of art a comic streisand working an already adoring audience in a studio circus populated with many fuzzy and furry animals and best of all a singing streisand in mini concert format just well frankly just doing it br br it amazes me that she still had the film debut of funny girl yet to come as well as turns as songwriter director and political activist here she is barely 24 years old doing extraordinary things because as she puts it in her own on camera introduction 'we didn't know we couldn't so we did ' the art museum sequence is shot in philadelphia over one weekend immediately after the museum closed to the public on saturday evening and apparently done with only one color camera yet there are cuts dissolves and tracking shots galore resulting in one rather spectacular peak moment the modern slightly beatnik flavored gotta move after getting lost amongst the modern jazz club bongos begin with streisand emerging in a psychedelic gown and glittering eye makeup doing the catchy staccato tune with almost androgynous sex appeal it is not until act 3 believe it or not that the moment is matched or bettered by another feat in the concert sequence in a white gown and pearl earrings streisand recites the torchy any place i hang my hat is home tearing into the final notes and revealing one of those climactic belts that makes you scream like a little girl even if you're 44 years old and a guy just plain old great television check it out
<START> first don't be fooled by my family name my mother was full blooded italian so i really know italian families and i love mobster movies even the funny ones like this br br for those people who have bad rapped this film you know who you are you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you don't know what good is this is a damn funny and well styled film the fact that almost nobody is italian in it is part of the joke so far as i can see and what red blooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of michelle pfieffer puh lease when i saw this film it won me over with the opening song by rosemary clooney who was as irish as one can get but her pronunciation of the italian words in mambo is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly hell i even bought the record the next day because of it just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that i have personally seen in my relatives houses though not in the same place which i found hysterical sold it for me br br this movie is like goodfellas on laughing gas i just wonder why there are no burger worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get my guess is the crew ate it the fries are crispy the shakes are creamy my mouth is watering almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous ms pfieffer and i never trusted clowns anyway and the three best things about this film are mercedes achingly funny mob wife spurned dean stockwell as her philandering husband tony the tiger and last but definitely not least the great mugging by oliver platt who should get more comic roles and note to myself find out where that black chick went ouch why does she work so infrequently this picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be
<START> outstanding performance by cardinal she carries this movie alone rip torn is great but just a shadow to a bitter sweet story of a woman who loves a very stubborn man beautiful funny sad touching a must see film
<START> this is actually a very good surreal mystery movie despite the description that tries to sell it as a sci fi movie balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together she spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions very atmospheric and effective it is true that kinski does not appear very much in this film but the staring actors are very good there is only an english dubbed version available in the us and the dubbing leaves something to be desired but the actors do a very good job the cinematography by academy award winner vittorio storaro is excellent an earlier giallo by director the fifth cord is also excellent and also lensed by
<START> i went to see this film out of curiosity and to settle an argument the film is now best known from the suite of music sergei extracted from his incidental music to the film the movement even turning up in pop arrangements the general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings a clerk accidentally generates a non existent lieutenant in a list to be presented to the the is interested in this person and rather than tell him he doesn't exist the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real is exiled to siberia recalled promoted married promoted again dies is given a state funeral revealed as an embezzler and posthumously to the ranks br br i had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented involving ink blots and sneezes but i'd heard the film was lost so there was no way to find out what happens then the film turned up at the in london as part of their festival for the record it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns into as the is in a hurry to see the order there's no time to correct the mistake br br having gone expecting an historical curiosity i was pleasantly surprised the film is very funny and the audience myself included laughed continuously although most of it is filmed straight set mostly in the palace there are a few trick shots where multiple images appear on the screen for instance the army is represented by a small group repeated across the screen four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison two identical servants scrub the floor br br one slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was there were two women who might have been the daughters or a daughter and a servant or something else and very few people were named but all in all an enjoyable film and i'm surprised it's not seen more often
<START> i like many others saw this as a child and i loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood i have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on tv someday since it originally played on usa networks does anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on tv again maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again i don't think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about people only know of the stepford wives and stepford husband movies no one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version maybe they should also do a re make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller horror flicks well if anyone has any input please i beg of you write me with information thanks taira aol com
<START> i was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940 before the united states entered world war ii on the surface satirizing something as solemn and horrible as nazi germany could be misconstrued as rash but chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything in fact the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did laughing at someone can be the best way to attack them while laughing with someone the jewish barber can be the best way to love them in the jewish final speech i forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago they are words that have meaning now and in any time of war for this reason i believe the film did far greater good than harm as it still has the same profound effect today
<START> 'wicked little things' really separates itself from other zombie movies first off all of the zombies in the movie don't exactly starting biting at you and tearing your flesh apart with their bare hands they kill you with either a or shovel and eat you after wards second they can't die in most zombie movies you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them but these simply won't die third which is the biggest reason why this movie separates itself all of the zombies are children how did they die exactly to become zombies they were working in a coal mine when suddenly they were all killed in a collapse now they wander the forest carrying their pickaxes and shovels waiting for someone to come by so they can kill them and eat them oh they also come out at night yep only at night that makes the movie even more fun then it would be if they came out in the morning despite all of the violent and gory mayhem in this movie 'wicked little things' is a great choice if you're looking for a movie about zombie children don't expect anything great like 'dawn of the dead' or 'land of the dead' but do expect lots of gore and violence that makes this movie a real zombie fan pleaser everyone give scout taylor compton from rob zombie's 'halloween' a big hand for delivering a great performance like the one she did in 'halloween' she really needs to start starring in more horror movies
<START> what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories you'd think so by some of the reviews al adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy not much more so if you go into them knowing that already it helps and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value first off this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits so you know things are looking promising this is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital of course nurse sherri tends to his needs and all and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her and nurse sherri begins to change no longer the nice nurse she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects there's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of co workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo this is not bad if you're a cult film fan but it may be bad if you're a spiderman fan because you won't like it at times this actually lurches towards respectability for adamson anyway but then it itself with some ridiculous event if you enjoy adamson's films and similar trash you may well like this for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure keep digging 7 out of 10
<START> my god i have not seen such an awful movie in a long long time saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes keira knightley tries really really hard in this one but she cant handle it dropped her accent every once in a while and didn't have the charisma to fill the role sienna millers acting gets you to a point where you start to ask yourself has she ever had acting lessons judging by the edge of love shes never been to acting class but should consider to go in the near future they both look really pretty maybe thats what they should focus on in their future career if they can be actresses everybody can
<START> although perhaps not as entertaining as some of herzog's work little dieter is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists departing from herzog's usual themes little dieter is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to go on living after a life traumatic experience br br dieter wanted to fly from a very young age and the viet nam war gave him that opportunity but instead of spending the war soaring in a cockpit he spent most of it grounded as a pow dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately with occasional help from herzog herzog does very little voice over this time but contributes a lot of subtly powerful and visuals which should be no surprise to those familiar with him br br is a fascinating and extremely likable person as human and as alive as they come i found the story of his life and his upbeat personality to be inspiring thanks to herzog for re introducing him to us br br the scale of the film is not as sprawling and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made herzog a force to be reckoned with nevertheless i strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries it's a very interesting and well executed film
<START> the strawberry blond has a great script but i just wish errol flynn was in it instead of james cagney he's not the person for the part i do think olivia did a great job this movie is also a day dream wrap around so it's hard to follow i don't like the male character attitude the way cagney presented it was just off i give it a 3 for poor acting by main male character if you like tough ruff men that like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie the strawberry blond would have been better if the main character had more of a attitude and change the script so he is happy he's with oliva br br this movie points out money does not bring happiness women right jokes plain and simple not the best movie but every one must decide for themselves
<START> well the film starts good but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid when all the plot is about karen's that was the name of the girl right pregnancy br br the end of the movie it's really corny and the characters really dumb br br i don't know who is more stupid if the girl because she came back with her old boyfriend or the boy for the way he was used for her br br anyway my conclusion is this definitely not the best eighties comedy just another movie like many others with nothing special they could do it better but they ruined it if only the plot had take another way but they keep that pregnancy stuff and they definitely ruined so final conclusion i don't like
