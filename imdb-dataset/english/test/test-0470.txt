<START> typical steven seagal fare that is it's crap the plot relies on a series of incredibly improbable coincidences there's a hefty dose of conspiracy theory which would be much more palatable if we didn't know that seagal takes it all literally and once again bad movie multi millionaire seagal tells us all about the evils of the rich br br seagal's survival relies as usual on the fact that bad guys never fire their guns from out of arm's reach and always like to give a little i'm gonna kill you speech before blowing a man's head off br br watch this one right after the even worse fire down below and note how the carpet in ivory wayans's apartment is more flammable than a big puddle of gasoline br br oh and watch in the final fight scene for the incredible disappearing forehead wound which is probably the most entertaining thing in the film
<START> Ã  br br this was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic source material and thoroughly succeeded br br do not see this film under any circumstances unless you wish to have your ten euros torn up and shoved up your nostrils by a bunch of vapid atrociously unamusing characters br br this type of film clearly illustrates the gulf that still unfortunately divides directors and audiences if the individual heaven forbid a collective could have conceived this dross behind this had been considerate enough to watch the version currently playing in french cinemas he or she would have endured what i was forced to endure and mercifully rewritten it or just scrapped it altogether the vein of adult humour being mined here dates to my mind back to fritz the cat but lacks that film's avant garde status or even its base attempt at social commentary br br with the proliferation of remakes and increasing reliance on pre existing source material to fund storytelling these days one would hope that choosing snow white and thus not having to worry about conceiving characters or a radically new story would have allowed more time for oh i don't know interesting animation smarter jokes perhaps a coherent film that has something to say and doesn't telegraph its vacuity from the opening frame br br a manifestly appalling production
<START> following the business coup of the year of 1941 max and dave the brothers fleischer were removed from their own studio by paramount pictures corporation former employees such as seymour and izzy were put in charge of the new operation now renamed famous studios by paramount early on the finished product of famous was indiscernible from that of the recent output by fleischer the existing series popeye superman continued as if nothing at all had transpired br br today's subject is one of the earlier famous studio's superman shorts br br as had been the custom the superman cartoons were a great combination of fine fittingly fashioned music in the score that goes for the theme overture as well as all the multi mood background incidental music it was if each cartoon short had its own background music as all was kept fresh by apparently recording it anew with each picture br br with regards to we must remember that this was filmed during the first year of the united states' involvement and the characterization of the enemy was very stereotypical short handed and outright evil the dialogue and personality of the villainous japanese saboteurs was strictly from the stock characters of the old pulp magazine stories with their every word being said in a sarcastic totally insincere politeness as the characters would flaunt their cold bloodedness as they made the most demonic of threats and outrageous acts toward the occidental world br br is visually bright and uplifting stunningly laid out and makes use of some multi plane or table top animation in order to give its flying sequences a real depth br br making good use of the tie ins between the animated cartoons the superman radio show then heard over the mutual broadcasting network the cartoon bears a close resemblance to the comics page and uses the very same talents of voice actors bud collyer and joan alexander from the radio show br br we rate it with a Â½ stars br br poodle schnitz
<START> this movie has no respect for the viewer's time it takes a 15 minute story and stretches it into 95 minutes in order to achieve this they have to use a very slow narration and have everyone run around with some implausible frantic angst by the time this movie showed anything interesting in the plot i just didn't care the problem is not in the acting but instead the pacing the story is just weak jim carrey is a capable actor but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role is just out of place his style of humor is not generic so he comes across as a watered down version of himself the number 23 causes great grief and frustration to the people in the story but the justification for this is never logical at most it's just mildly interesting jim carrey has far more ability in a serious role than this movie reveals don't waste your money seeing this in the theater rent this movie if you've had problems sleeping if you are still wide awake after 10 minutes then you liked it more than i did i was not fond of the lighting and artistic aspects of the film making either a lot of passive visual eye candy was thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects and it did little to enhance the already weak story
<START> one year after 'love thy neighbour' made its i t v debut it followed the route taken by 'on the and son' by graduating onto the big screen in a picture made by hammer films it opens with a stirring patriotic speech the virtues of england's green and pleasant land then cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up a street arguing furiously this escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbours vandalising their each other's homes at least the original theme tune is retained even if it is sung by someone other than stuart gillies br br the local paper 'the is holding a contest to find the best neighbours the winners landing a mediterranean cruise barbie suggests to joan that they should enter the thing is can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it that's the main part of the plot the film is by and large episodic one chunk is lifted directly from season 1 namely bill and eddie going to the club pretending to be on 'union business' in reality they're going to see a stripper not meeting two girls another portion of the movie has bill along with other black factory workers in the series he was the only one breaking a strike eddie has helped bring about by various ploys including being smuggled in through the gates in beer barrels while another seemingly inspired by powell and driver's 'for the love of ada' sees eddie's talkative mother the magnificent patricia hayes getting friendly with bill's father charles br br the climax to episode 1 season 1 reappears in an expanded form bill once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify eddie but his friends join him and they dance round a drum containing a naked booth so that they can pretend to cook and eat him eddie then has to make his way home in the nude surprisingly there is less nudity here than there was in episode 2 season 2 br br the film ends with the reynolds and the winning the 'love thy neighbour' contest and taking the cruise together but there's an unexpected twist involving joan's sex mad brother cyril james beck 'private of 'dad's army' who is working as a steward br br this is your typical '70's sitcom into movie with all the faults usually prevalent in such films the laughs are scattered about and interest wanes after about half an hour the cast is augmented by familiar faces such as melvyn hayes cast as a character from episode 2 season 1 played on that occasion by leslie meadows bill fraser as the factory manager anna dawson lawrence who seems to have been in every '70's british comedy film mostly cast as nymphomaniacs and arthur english the director john robins was also responsible for the 'man about the house' movie br br funniest moment while eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory bill paints his face black the first he knows of it is when the manager's secretary screams in terror the tables have been turned
<START> it is difficult to rate a writer director's first effort after all it is one more movie than i have written or directed james hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffered from an uneven flow br br after all the idea that a man ja rule has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common and even falling in love with the daughter ali of the man you killed has been done doing it again demands something that is original and originality is lacking in this film br br i was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites tia carrere lies wayne's world pam grier jackie brown frank langella dracula good night and good luck and ving rhames dawn of the dead they did not disappoint in their performances but they had little to work with br br direct to video is becoming more and more common but that doesn't mean it has to be a waste of time maybe the sophomore effort of hunter will be more enjoyable
<START> thankyou for making such a wonderful escape that's what i love about movies i'm so impressed with the the way they were shot and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music being a dancer myself and having been a part of many dance films choreography is usually chopped diced and sometimes not even to the beat showgirls the movie the relationship between the ladies was ever so present in the movement br br my favorite scene is the last one when she is pulled over i've seen the movie before a different version and i disliked the husband more last time i felt a little more sorry for him this time it changes how i feel about the female love birds its all so magical
<START> my dad had this movie as an 8mm reel i loved it when he would pull out the projector tape a sheet to the wall and play gerald the thought of a child who communicated through sounds fascinated me br br nine years ago my son was as autistic the doctors would ask me questions about my son such as how does he communicate with you i would respond have you ever seen the cartoon gerald i would love to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators this is how my son see he's world br br recently i spoke with a digital transfer specialist who indicated most personal 8mm films did not contain sound until the mid 1970's i guess i was pretty lucky to have experienced the sights and sounds of gerald in 1972
<START> ok so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted right right consider yourselves officially warned and read on br br in this parody tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history the 1980's a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a in the house of the notorious murder mcgee who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard as i'm sure you can guess things go from bad to worse faster than you can say where's the beef and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody the dialogue is cheesy and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get good times br br no clique or 80's horror movie clichÃ©d characterizations are left here in fact no stone was left unturned at all Â we have the cool hero his innocent girlfriend the goth chick the tough thug think john bender the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt a couple of gorgeous half naked lesbians and two big geeks br br as you can plainly see the cast is pretty big usually larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly with one or two sour apples up the whole barrel not in this case though not a single cast member left me disappointed the acting was very well done everyone from the cool hero in his thriller jacket played by jovan meredith to the goth chick played by renee dorian to geeks one two played by cory jonathan brett Â they all played it straight brought their a game and knocked it out of the park if you're a fan of gary wyatt in weird science you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks br br director co writer jeff c smith is a guy to watch for in the future trust me on this if this is what he can do with a low budget there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects the characters were dead on the atmosphere was perfect the laughs were huge the blood flowed and squirted and sprayed beautifully Â it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980's call this one the breakfast club meets night of the demons the tag line says it all and says it honestly excessive violence gratuitous nudity zero budget no false advertising here folks as fans of this genre we have to look to the indies and support these hard working folks who are busting their out there bringing us original tales lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered down pg 13 'horror' or pointless remakes like the hitcher no thank you no more of that for me br br in closing i honestly have to say that stupid teenagers must die is by far one of the best indie flicks i've gotten the pleasure of watching this year it's a bloody good time and holds up on repeat viewings from the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe even the closing love theme over the end credits which if that doesn't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid 80's power ballads by over pronounced r's on every word starting with the letter 'r' then i'll eat my dvd right now bottom line is if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general no more hesitation this flick deserves to be in your collection
<START> the first episode of 'man to man with dean that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of marenghi's and had me at my hope it keeps up the good work of on my tv richard is one of the best in the new breed of alternative comedy i hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one comedians on tv today i'm glad that on a trip of local dvd retailers today garth marenghi's darkplace was sold out across the board even from his brief stint in nathan barley i knew that was a serious talent and i'm sure he would have been great as dixon in 'the mighty to continued success in the vein of these programs i also felt it necessary to extend my review in order to secure a place on this public domain
<START> i don't see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor you need to get your head out of your up tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious if this isn't your cup of tea so to speak then look at it for what it truly is a damn funny movie maybe they did set out to make yet another drugs t a movie but in this case they've truly hit the spot it's especially funny for the ali g fans because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him so i say big ups to ali g and if it's not your thing don't whine batty boy
<START> lame ridiculous and absurd my 6 year old son talked us into watching this rubbish tripe stereotypes and themes not appropriate for children the antithesis of the commercialism of christmas is not socialism it's jesus
<START> years ago the feature film tried to be some kind of regional blockbuster in austria one thing's for sure i hope no one outside will ever have to see this one perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom it could be interesting to watch what director made of his series i think he missed his chance and wasted time and money br br so far many director's and writers have failed to make a series concept compatible to a 90min movie consider alf inspector gadget you can see how hard this is by watching ma the result of this attempt in my opinion tastes like a never ending tv episode and not a good one it fails to deliver a plot the humor tries too hard and the directing seems very unfocused as holds true for the visual style br br so summing up i'd clearly not recommend this one
<START> caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield ty webb is funny being the only character from the original most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original henry wilcoxon for example except for the funny lawyer peter blunt being played by randy quaid every line he says reminds me of the originals humor especially the scene at his office i don't go in for law suits or motions i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f ing baseball bat make a bonfire with the maybe roast that golden retriever then eat it and then i'm comin' upstairs junior and i'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a do we have an understanding his small role however is dan who is obviously no replacement for bill murray his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny its just stupid overall caddyshack ii is a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it
<START> i watched this movie at a party we were very puzzled by the ending it ended rather poor even though the entire movie isn't too amazing i was expecting something slightly better this movie is pure trash but i suggest you watch it if you find cheap horror films with a weak script quite funny personally i loved the advert it was my overall highlight the fighting scenes were basic a shot of a knife some shadows in a window fake blood i must say the granny costume was quite scary this film is a mixture of kill joy camp blood and boggy creek 2 except this film has slightly better camera wok and colour treatment compared with camp blood
