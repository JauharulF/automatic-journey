<START> frank sinatra took this role chewed it up with the rest of the scenery and spat it out his way is stagey the ending is trite some of the scenes need a little more cutting but that's all it's great entertainment from start to finish and while you watch it you realise that sinatra that long dead mor crooner had junkies gangster card games and the whole us urban hustle thing in his blood he didn't learn it from an acting coach there are all sorts of directorial touches to keep you amused and the non dated soundtrack cooks all the way the marathon card game beat goodfellas sopranos etc by forty years so it wasn't faithful to the book what movie is and i can't imagine it being remembered if brando had been let loose on it the cold turkey scenes would have been embarrassing instead of edgy convincing and moving with sinatra no one else has mentioned the seedy lazy cynical cops absolutely spot on and eleanor parker would have driven me to smack
<START> i saw this film via one of the actors' agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of australia in terms of the overall tone which is rightly dark and moody br br i thought the little boy in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are hammed up and embarrassing but not in this case he was really very good in terms of the surrealism thingy mentioned by well i just think this film is plain ' it's a real weirdo film with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole time but 'good' weird as opposed to 'bad' br br its hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the 60's its certainly has an interesting mind working behind it br br my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also what did you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious
<START> judith as the scamming old whore is awesome emily grace the young girl is innocent and exciting as she learns whats going down excellent direction and camera story is dark and disturbing supporting cast is good shows what happens and can happen with a run of bad luck great independent film small cast pace is slow at first and then moves good a good movie to show your teen age daughter who has aspirations of leaving home early for the open road and adventure this movie film has a low budget feel to it but it works because of the low lifes and areas that these people move in i will never stop a rest stop again with out thinking of this movie and checking my tires before i go
<START> i saw this movie for the first time on nbc friday 11 29 02 it was a pretty good movie but i don't think it would be the kind of muppet movie jim henson would make i mean first of all using the word sexy every now and then and pepe saying it would suck and i defenitly know jim henson wouldn't allow kermit yelling i wish i'd never been born thirteen time a minute this movie just isn't like a classic muppet movie sure i can understand nicky holiday stealing the baseball diamond from the great muppet caper but a business lady cheating the muppets in a contract for their theater to turn it into a smoker's nightclub if jim henson was here today he would hate this movie
<START> so then this is what passes as high art for the likes of sxsw film festival and sundance eh well i suppose i can relate as long as story script dialog acting save for ms cinematography and editing are completely irrelevant br br i remember telling other film making friends some years ago that the biggest problem with digital video was that we were now going to have to wade through a future sea of crap to get to anything worth watching now that anyone and his brother or brothers in the case of the could run out and make a movie the puffy chair need i say more br br this feature length video is yet another chapter in the dismal ever expanding world of movies young guns armed with a a few thousand dollars a hastily written shallow script and some friends they call actors who decide one afternoon to make a movie and voilÃ  instant feature video makers don't get me wrong i'm all about independent cinema i e hollywierd sucks but having said that you can't argue with some of the realities of that system br br if the brothers would've had to have gone out and raised a real budget and bring on real producers its clear a script like this would never have been green lighted and therein lies the problem there is no longer such a thing as a vetting process for getting films sorry videos ready for production just grab a dv camera and off you go and what makes it worse is that high profile festivals like the aforementioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense and why precisely because its no budget br br i think its important especially in todays climate of indie films to quit allowing video makers to high jack the language by labeling themselves filmmakers there is quite a difference in my book when you have to go out and actually put your script on the line asking friends and family or business people for real money to make a feature film knowing the potentially losses at stake then you will know what it means to be a filmmaker but dropping a few hundred at sam's club for some dv tapes some soda and chips doesn't cut it br br oh and by the way i have to mention how utterly annoying it was to listen to a female being addressed as dude throughout the entire movie even mark reserves that intensely overused moniker for his male friends only where it is at least endearing where his buddy mike is concerned br br i think its high time the indie film community started to call out these shoddy no budget videos for what they are and simultaneously scold prestigious festivals for giving such casual efforts high praise either that or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their festival line ups dude films
<START> br br headlines warn us of the current campaign to drug users note the nostalgia for mussolini in italy and remind us of our wont to profile likely terrorists focus reminds us of the evils of rampant fear and distrust and the anti semitism disguised as pro americanism of the wwii era what goes around br br lawrence newman william c macy becomes the unfortunate victim of hate crimes after he is mistaken for a jew and these attacks increase when his bride laura dern highlights the look newman rails against the false accusations when they cause him direct harm but he minds his own business we see the rise in anti semitic attacks through his myopia a condition not completely cured by eyeglasses br br macy's typical everyman role is featured again and the long road to realization that we are all connected nearly costs him his life br br what is it about the character macy portrays to us we can't choose to ignore the violence hate and bigotry because citizenship forces us to take sides newman's dilemma is that he has no alternative but to side with the mistreated and goes through hell to see it and our sadness is that most of us need to be beaten up to realize the dangers surrounding us br br let's focus
<START> spoilers spoilers there must have been something in the air in the immediate postwar years that made night cities attractive settings for movies a gaggle of nocturnal urban films were made at that time and not just in america one of the most notable was carol reed's odd man out an english picture about a wounded gunman staggering through the streets of belfast in america it was the high noon or more properly high midnight of film noir br br crossfire isn't really film noir but has the trappings of noir though it uses them for its own aims which have to do with bigotry directed by edward written by john paxton it was adapted from a novel by richard brooks the book concerned the murder of a homosexual in the movie the victim is changed to a jew though filmed like a mystery there is little suspense in the film as it is fairly obvious who the murderer is early on what makes the film so watchable and beautiful is its evocation of a city washington d c just after world war ii by some of the most gifted craftsmen working in films at that time unlike many night movies crossfire is set mostly indoors in police stations rooming houses and all night movie theaters soldiers are everywhere in the film and most are itching to get back to their civilian lives yet one senses from most of the men we meet that their personalities have been so shaped by their military experience it's going to be tough for them to return to their old neighborhoods for some maybe even impossible they seem more bound to one another than to anything or anyone else br br yet some men never truly bonded with anyone in the military the murderer monty is one such individual one senses that he was never connected in his civilian life either he is a lone wolf who also needs people desperately alone he has a sadistic streak a mile wide and always needs someone nearby to be the butt of his jokes the man he kills did him no harm and was in fact a stranger to him but once monty figured out the man's religion that was enough he didn't really mean to kill the guy as it was his intent to humiliate him and just beat him up but as he was quite drunk at the time monty's fists got the better of him it is this act that sets the story the story in motion br br once the movie builds up a head of steam the other characters come rapidly into focus monty's opposite number is another soldier who though introspective like monty and somewhat detached harbors no resentment toward anyone and seems a reasonable even amiable guy finley the pipe smoking homicide detective is dandyish and a tad effete compared to the men in uniform but proves more than a match for the various and mostly soldiers he deals with the actors who plays these roles roberts ryan mitchum and young give excellent performances each in a different key ryan as monty is tense and paranoid always looking around for someone to pick on and one can feel his anxiety over becoming a victim himself as mitchum is low key almost nonchalant he never raises his voice and he seems to have more to say more to offer than is permitted by the script young's performance has often been criticized as being too soft but i find it deceptively strong and nicely offbeat he cuts against the stereotype of the hardboiled cop and makes the character of finley a bit of a prince of crime detection br br there are few surprises in crossfire though the script is at times surprisingly well written even brilliant character actor paul kelly gives one of the best short performances in the movies as the of a woman a soldier picks up in a bar kelly may or may not be her husband and he may or may not live with her though he seems relaxed enough in her apartment the beauty of these scenes are that nothing is made clear and this man himself seems more than a little confused over what his role is was or ought to be in a way these few scenes form the thematic core of the film which is with the exception of the detective all the men in the film are drifting aimless and basically lost some more seriously than others in this respect crossfire is for all the preaching near the end a film about the vagueness of identity and how easily it can be lost or warped men drift from one bar to another in this film as they engage in a sort of woozy camaraderie their personalities merging into a kind of general american male template then something happens something is nailed down a word is mentioned whether or and things suddenly turn tense and the very notion of individuality of an identity outside the group of anyone not like them becomes deeply offensive even loathsome then after tempers flare and whatever stirred them up has been resolved or forgotten the men revert to their loose non personal group normality and order is restored
<START> at first i honestly thought it would be a corny movie but after seeing this i was quite surprised amanda bynes was convincingly funny along with the supporting cast especially that character played by bullet tooth tony from snatch what a contrasting role between those two movies now i'm not one to say whether or not an actor is good or not but her act especially was thoroughly enjoyable even though the plot devolved into a teeny bopper love triangle though very funny half way into the movie i feel that this shouldn't discount what i think the movie really is simply entertaining so if you happen to stumble upon it whether by dvd or theater i'm confident that you'll enjoy
<START> well groomed well behaved teen meg tilly must spend the night in a creepy mausoleum as an initiation into a high school club problem is a powerful psychic named was just buried there that day but he isn't quite dead and he needs the life force of humans for his powers br br obscure horror film offers plenty of thrills and chills an appealing and likeable cast and most superior special effects br br my rating 7 out of 10 br br one dark night is rated r for violence and adult themes
<START> this is a modest unassuming traditional western with a formulaic plot about opposition between ranchers and crop farmers around the town of liberal kansas the story is essentially routine and features a number of the classic western conflicts there is the farmer versus the cattleman there is the clash between cultivated land and civilizing tendencies on the one hand and the wilderness frontier ethos on the other and what this represents ultimately is the opposition of two value systems democratic and community values as set against rugged individualism br br randolph scott plays legendary lawman bat masterton who rides into liberal at behest of a land agent robert ryan to help him sort out the bad guys who are the hard drinking brawling cattlemen the two men quarrel but reunite to tackle the troublesome elements in the town br br the script is clichÃ©d but the action is propelled along with vigour by director ray enright and there are solid performances all round in addition to rugged performances by the male leads there is comic relief supplied by george gabby hayes an oily villain nicely played by steve brodie and attractive contributions from maggie meredith as a prim and proper wooed by ryan and anne jeffreys as a saloon singer as long as you do not place a premium on originality this is good sturdy entertainment for western lovers
<START> the chemistry between sally hawkins and elaine cassidy was incredible they were thoroughly convincing and genuinely likable in their roles imelda staunton played the conniving mrs brilliantly despite the fact that she was a dastardly opportunist she somehow managed to have you sympathizing with her in the end rupert evans played the slime ball gentleman with sheer charm and he was a scene stealer the story itself was very unique as was the manner in which it was told the victorian england setting featuring two lesbian lead characters was intriguing and delightful there were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that really kept the audience engaged in the story a wonderful cast and excellent story made this film superb
<START> i've come to realise through watching this sort of film that i don't like them very much caged women is yet another 'women in prison' film and like the most of the rest of the genre the plot is completely forsaken in favour of simply showing nude women now don't get me wrong i love nude women but i also like there to be some sort of plot thread to go with the nudity and since this film has only the basic 'women are in prison' theme running through it aswell as the essential escape of course i got a bit bored before the end the film is good because there's barely a moment in it where the women are wearing clothes but that's about the only positive element director and writer ha ha erwin c dietrich delights in showing close ups of the naked female body but it's never very erotic the director was the producer on a number of trash flicks including some directed by jess franco in my opinion he should stick to producing as his writing talents are non existent and he doesn't seem to know how to film a sex scene this sort of material is rather dry a lot of the time but i reckon franco could have made more out of it overall this might suffice for people that are really into this sort of stuff but i can't say i enjoyed it
<START> clint eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993 teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense wolfgang peterson eastwood delivers as only he can also john malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin as for rene russo as clint's love interest i think kirk douglas said it best when he said referring to his own career i keep getting older and my leading ladies keep getting younger this film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going eastwood and peterson should team together more often top notch movie
<START> crash is overwrought over thought and over baked a great example of how to make a pompous and self important film with a message haggis tries too hard to make his point and in just about every category of the film it feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer to the skull sure race relations affect everyone and there's a great deal of ambiguity to the issue but the universe of operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race it's a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes i found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die the fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on imdb is a testament to the public's willingness to get suckered by hollywood malarkey br br indeed if you want the real crash go check out the one by david cronenberg dark twisted and original this film plays as preachy tiresome and masochistic
<START> this line is a good summary of this movie if you have read it and watched 20 minutes of the movie you will know exactly how the rest of the movie is going to behave some researcher named pronounced are searching for hell in the underworld of moscow however he seems to have disappeared and his friend oven follows with a team to search after him could they have find a more boring plot some bad actors looking after an old man in the underground the acting is very bad the romance really feels pointless and untrue often there is no good reason for the way the characters are acting nothing is scary and most of all there's not happening anything interesting in the whole entire movie they just walk asking some gang leaders and other guys about the way walk some more complain some finds the old man and then they run and finally finds the way out of the underground br br the only thing that provides me from giving this movie the lowest of all ratings is the atmosphere if you just want to see a movie for that this may be a good choice it's dark and it's mystical and murky however the rest of the movie is really dull you just sit there all the time waiting for the movie to begin or something to happening it's actually happening some things but they are not very well performed for example i didn't really notice when one of the characters disappeared and i swear i wasn't sleeping or something and i don't understand what's dangerous with these children they just run around in the underground together scratching it walls with sticks i suppose it is meant to be scary in some way br br just watch this movie if you are in immediate need of some murky atmospheres
