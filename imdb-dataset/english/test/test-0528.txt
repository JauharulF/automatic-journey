<START> better than the original the gamers dorkness rising manages to pull off a funny comedy with good acting fine special effects and comedy that transcends the gamer knowledge base and do so on a low budget i've seen many low budget films that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high budget counterparts this film blows most mainstream movies away parts are a bit weak the bit with the pirates and ninjas while funny goes on a bit long without explanation and takes you out of the movie for a bit but overall this is a very strong film br br i'm very happy to say that i bought this film as soon as i saw it and brought it home br br any chance we can look forward to another feature gamers movie from these guys
<START> i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie of course as i'm sure you know that in the middle star frankie and the ever so sweet amanda bynes the amanda show starred in this children's comedy as two friends that i'm sure that we can all re late to the movie is about a boy jason shepard frankie and his friend amanda going onto an adventure in hollywood br br spoilers ahead br br as it begins jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems one day jason is hit by mr wolf the big bad director jason's english paper is stolen by wolf and begins the adventure along with to earn his father's trust back they fly to hollywood in search of wolf to get him back frankie and amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get wolf back and all he has to do is call jason's dad and tell him he stole his idea but the end is no real surprise being the good and wins br br the story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect it's rated pg i really belive this is one of the years best family comedies not only is the childrens acting great exceptional casting well written but it's good clean fun it made me laugh as well as fall in love with it's innocent message i highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten the unemployed critic isn't unemployed for nothing i give it well i voted a ten out of ten a perfect
<START> when you first sit down to watch this movie keep in mind that you are about to see something you've probably never seen before keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent insane amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter the crazy thing i noticed is that every character is completely over portrayed and it seems most of the time anyhow that the film had been up' to make the characters move faster i wonder if the hong kong version was dubbed too i understand the cartoon had this but it doesn't work for live action it just looks odd as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors br br the english version is horribly dubbed and the character's words do not match the mouths at all i would have subtitles but since this is a kids movie and since some kids cannot read well i'll let it go but there is something extremely odd about this movie it's supposedly a kids movie but there's a lot of material about sex rape and stripping which isn't exactly for young western audiences in the orient they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted but parents be warned there is a scene where two characters talk about rape multiple scenes where people say 'sex and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts who was this movie made for anyway br br oh and the special effects are laughable you can tell the spaceship like things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts or animation i wasn't sure that look unconvincing even to a kid the makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon simply because they couldn't budget the kind of money they'd need i didn't like how the names of all the characters were changed it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as dragon ball z br br i don't really this movie to anyone kids adults or dragon ball z fans it's just a poor representation of the cartoon and obviously one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it i won't even get into the camerawork just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes most of the shots are not framed correctly at all and the movie just seems made by amateurs grainy film quality too br br just all around horrible br br
<START> it's been said that some directors make small budget pictures look like blockbusters albert pyun makes small budget pictures look like high school a v project films this film was pretty much lacking in all departments practically every scene drags on excessively the experimental lighting and camera work is terrible rob lowe apparently equated being scruffy with acting and the poor drab euro pop numbers stop the movie to a dead halt on the plus side burt reynolds does a pretty good job with what he's given which isn't much mario van peebles is surprisingly decent and ice t puts in another of a long recent string of b movie gangsters not pyun's worst work urban menace but certainly not his best mean guns
<START> man kills bear man becomes bear man bear meets bear man bear stays man bear after meeting bear the end seriously that is the entire plot to this movie yes i simplified it to an extreme but you get the picture i just wish i maybe had not have seen it br br the 'man alluded to is a native american indian that kills a mother of a cub and while that can be touching it certainly lacks to really draw in on the potential conflict between the two parties plus there was a certain misuse of the two moose in the film but that is beyond the point br br overall very much under par certainly needed a lot more to be entertaining maybe more laughs from the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears thats what separates bad films from the good ones d
<START> one of the worst movies i saw in the 90s i'd often use it as a benchmark when viewing other films at least it wasn't as bad as caro diario three absolutely pointless segments all featuring the director playing himself and he's not that interesting a whole segment about this hypochondriac going to the doctor another that features him riding around the countryside on his scooter for three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous ones br br the only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set to keith concert' prompted me to go home and rediscover that marvelous album the best thing you can say about the director actor egotist is that he's got great taste in music
<START> there is a lot wrong with this film i will not lie i will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick and some bad hack job editing br br this is not office space do not go in expecting office space levels of comedy it is very funny though it is a mess but very funny at the same time a funny mess of a film in the way that caddyshack is funny a mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes br br it works as a whole though and it certainly deserves a wide release this is the best commentary on the wal mart starbucks mtv nation you could hope for the very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate while the intelligent people are not is great in my book not very politically correct but worth at least some debate
<START> the film chaos takes its name from 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory what does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie chaos nothing the film makers seem to have skimmed the book obviously without understanding a thing about it looking for a theme to united the series of mundane action sequences that the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film in this respect the movie resembles the canadian effort cube in which prime numbers function as a device to the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed in cube a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes the same approach is taken in chaos disconnected extracts from books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever this of course is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience and any literate viewer of chaos who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered how could a film so bad be made rewritten as a novel the story in chaos would probably not even make it past a literary agent's secretary's desk how could at least hundreds of thousands and probably millions of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film regarding what's in the movie every performance is phoned in save for technical glitches it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene the story is uniformly senseless the last time i saw a story to disconnected it was the production of a literal eight year old among other massive shortcomings are the following the bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow he has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints police officers do not carry or use radios dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film if there is any other movie you like or even simply do not hate watch that instead
<START> this is my favourite columbo martin landau excellent plays twins one of whom may have committed a murder this columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it peter falk is on form as usual in this episode written by steven bochco who also wrote 'murder by the book' my second favourite episode the supporting cast are great especially julie newmar very under rated and jeanette nolan as the house keeper that columbo just keeps on upsetting the surname of martin characters in this is 'paris' that was the surname of leonard nimoy's character in mission impossible coincidence or a steven bochco joke
<START> in pasadena mrs davis joanna cassidy sends her daughter aubrey davis amber tamblyn to tokyo to bring her sister karen davis sarah michelle gellar who is interned in a hospital after surviving a fire back to the usa after their meeting karen dies and aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and gets herself cursed in the same situation being chased by the ghost of the house meanwhile in tokyo the three high school mates allison arielle kebbel vanessa teresa palmer and uno visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and chased by the ghost in chicago trish jennifer beals moves to the apartment of her boyfriend bill christopher cousins who lives with his children the teenager lacey sarah and boy jake matthew knight on the next door weird things happen with their neighbor br br the grudge 2 has scary sound and visual effects with the creepy woman and boy and i have startled a couple of times while watching this movie however the complex screenplay with three subplots is totally confused making the entwined story a complete mess there are too much characters and situations and in a certain moment i was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented narrative in the end i was completely disappointed with this confused but also spooky film my vote is four br br title brazil o 2 the scream 2
<START> interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination son of the gods is rather too long and contains some hammy acting but on the whole remains a fascinating film br br story about a chinese passing as white starts as leaves college after being insulted by a trio of brainless co eds he embarks on a world tour to discover himself and ends up as secretary to a british playwright claude king in monte carlo he meets beautiful wagner constance bennett and they fall in love but when she discovers he is chinese she goes berserk in a memorable scene br br plagued by guilt and love goes into a mental spiral and makes a few attempts to contact after his father dies he takes over the business banking and dons chinese garb as a symbol of his hatred of the white race that has spurned him after a san francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth makes the decision to honor his chinese father and mother br br and i agree that one reviewer here never saw this film declares her love for sam before he tells her of his recent discovery and that makes all the difference in this film br br and bennett each have a few scenes where they chew the scenery but on the whole this is a solid and interesting drama frank albertson is good as the nice college pal claude king is solid as the playwright bess flowers has one scene as an oklahoma indian and e alyn warren is the chinese father dorothy mathews is nasty alice not so good are anders as bennett's father and mildred van dorn as eileen also note the gorgeous blonde to the right of at the roulette table what a stunner whoever she was
<START> this extremely bargain basement blaxploitation kung fu hybrid was in my country released by a questionable dvd label that usually speaking just occupies with the transfer of pure crap onto disc so that wasn't exactly a favorable herald several other titles were released in the same series like the black six the black gestapo and the black godfather and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews none of these belong to the elite of the 70's blaxploitation hype neither tnt jackson is a pretty lousy film completely lacking a significant plot but featuring far too many laughable fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate apparently roger corman Â never too embarrassed to make some easy money Â assigned two of his most loyal acolytes to rapidly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of both oriental kung fu movies and contemporary trendy blaxploitation flicks the result h santiago and dick miller came up with was tnt jackson the tale of an arse whooping black babe traveling to hong kong in search of her missing brother she quickly discovers he was killed by a criminal network of drug smugglers and swears to avenge him mrs jackson smoothly infiltrates into the underground and encounters macho pimps helpful undercover agents loads of vicious kung fu fighters only one thing's for sure they all want a piece of ravishing body in one way or another i sincerely doubt movie concepts get any more elementary than this but Â unfortunately all the other aspects suck too the battle scenes are overlong and moreover pathetically staged jeannie bell and the other poor suckers try really hard to stare menacingly and assume a tough position but eventually all they ever do is kick in the air and stupidly leap across rooms the cinematography is horrid the soundtrack is vastly disappointing whatever happened to soul music the few dialogs are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior speaking of which jeannie bell is undeniably a beautiful woman but still she can't hold a candle to tamara dobson or pam grier there's only one really good and memorable scene in tnt jackson namely the famous hotel room battle where bell entirely naked except for panties repeatedly switches the light on and off whilst kicking the hell out of some goons amusing scene i just haven't figured out yet whether it's thanks to the light switch ingenuity or bell's perfectly shaped breasts
<START> the majesty of ramin second feature is that like the work of a poet he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen beyond the scope of most other indie films out there chop shop is wise exuding the very best of the great cinema of the ages we can look back at the works of bresson and pasolini and compare work to theirs and yet chop shop is fresh and urgent to modern society we can see the workings of a master here Â a certain sense of beauty style and content all merge together in a film that reminds us what it means to be alive instead of focusing on the side of nyc we so often see we live and breathe with our young hero alejandro in the destitute point Â a fascinating quasi sub world of our culture Â and yet it's a very very real place trying to stay afloat alejandro has to support himself and his older sister watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that leads us toward Â all with profound and concise realism
<START> yes in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make it has its funny moments but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me you can not come up with a good story your effects are going to really be bad hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort it also had better effects too this one is just a step or two ahead of hobgoblins as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost actually i am just kidding but really it was the funniest part of the movie
<START> i like seeing linda blair playing in an actual horror movie again i had been disappointed with her in most everything since the exorcist movies which i loved what was up with all of those nasty b movies she did br br david on the other hand all i could do is laugh he is not cut out to be a horror movie actor david needs to stick to knight rider or baywatch br br all around this is an awesome movie even for the eighties this was an awesome film it has horror action and drama it is a suspenseful and i loved the way linda blair turned out
