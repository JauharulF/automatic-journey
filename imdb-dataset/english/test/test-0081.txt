<START> hey you are not alone i remember nichols i was just 17 when it was on i remember james garner was one of the coolest actors and nichols was such a great show i couldn't believe it was on such a short time wish i could remember the last episode i probably didn't see it there were no vcr's back then so it when it was on you saw it and if you missed an episode it was gone forever unless it came back on summer reruns anyway sure would be great if it came out on dvd but i don't think that many people even knew about it what a shame br br garner would hit it big a few years later with rockford files and he brought along his buddy stuart margolin from nichols to play his sidekick angel
<START> this movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life while i like how the director chan wook park handled the revenge the move as a whole was terrible oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story i will say that the english dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable i felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself also if you have an aversion to annoying voices then avoid hearing jeong kang she plays mi do speak if you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others then watch away if you don't want to watch a movie filled with incest bad dialogue unnecessary fight scenes gross torture scenes and confusing flashbacks then this is not the movie for you
<START> so after the initial disappointment of the first final fantasy movie which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the final fantasy series final fantasy advent children has released itself to a warm reception and now a dedicated fanbase and the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters however if you haven't played then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game secondly there is no character development without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not of course for fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain at least for nostalgic reasons and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation one last complaint the film at least in my opinion attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed if you played and enjoyed than it is a worthwhile watch though nothing too special if you have not played then it is best that you play it first before watching this film
<START> saw the move while in paris in may 2006 i was debating between that and mission impossible i am very glad i choose oss 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch a french movie while in france i had a great time would recommend it it is important to have some understanding the french society of today to really enjoy the humor of this movie cannot wait for the dvd to come out i don't know how some of the de would be translated in english i certainly buy it when it is out p s i saw on de nice' which is a movie starring that all kids were talking about in france this movie is a comedy but sillier than one can imagine in comparing both movies i have to say that did a good job in oss 117
<START> i hated the first movie is really boring and we only get see the octopus at the end br br the plot dead bodies are being found in the new york harbor the police have no clues nor suspects until nick and his colleague realize the killer is a giant octopus everybody especially the police captain refuses to believe nick's story and soon the harbor will be filled with boats for the 4th of july celebrations br br in this movie we get to see more of the giant octopus and special effects for this movie are really good for it's time br br the acting is this movie not bad but not great too but okay and watch able br br the are some really cheese scenes to movie but if can get past that you should enjoy the rest of movie br br 5 10
<START> only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb the first difficulty faced by the submarine is what appear to be chunks of rock falling down through the water and crashing into its hull but it's not rock they're under the north pole it is ice everybody except possibly hitherto mentioned small children and even some of them know that ice floats br br then disaster strikes that darn van allen radiation belt around the earth catches fire no one knows how this happened we are told which is understandable because it is utterly impossible for radiation to catch fire and even if it could there is no air in space for it to burn br br there is literally no good reason to overlook science concepts basic to 2nd grade school textbooks when making a film however irwin allen manages to do it again and again perhaps we are meant to focus on the people instead which is pretty easy as they are cardboard br br the cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub kiddie romp much like later episodes of his lost in space tv series the concept of which was swiped outright from writer ib melchior and then rushed into production br br the sub looks pretty good though which is why this one gets a 2
<START> is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection they take a scene from the order starring jean claude van damme and this angers me because van damme is a personally favourite for b movie comedy segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself br br it also annoys me how he didn't do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films in conclusion of all this if you are prepared to see a movie fit for a trash can or woodchipper then rent today you die
<START> footprints on the moon is almost certainly the strangest most convoluted and most atypical giallo ever made it may come as a restraint to some of the sub genre's fans but this film doesn't feature many of the regular giallo trademarks like bloody knife murders preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves ravishing scantily dressed beauties and unpredictable red herrings however to compensate for all this Â and much more Â footprints benefices from the most indescribably mysterious and non stop compelling atmosphere i ever experienced in this type of film the level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared like the female protagonist alice herself you absolutely have no idea of what's happening or why and this feeling of utter powerlessness is unquestionably the film's main strongpoint as a viewer you crave to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her but you simply can't alice has a successful career as an interpreter but her quiet and peaceful life gets brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize she has absolutely no recollection of the previous three days she finds a torn apart photograph of a hotel located on the holiday island gama and decides to go there in order to investigate what happened on the island several people including a lonely little girl seem to recognize alice only she used the fake name nicole wore a red haired wig and acted like she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger meanwhile even the poor girl's nights are restless as she has reoccurring dreams of astronauts hopping on the moon surface and an uncanny scientist called dr blackman the plot of footprints is truly bizarre and slowly brooding and particularly the cosmic sub plot is really difficult to link with the rest alice assumes they are just images from a sci fi movie she saw long time ago which sounds like a reasonable enough explanation but you sense there's a deeper meaning and actual connection to all the other events fans of tension driven and stylish italian cinema can't afford themselves to miss this film really this is director's luigi psychological tour de force with staggeringly beautiful photography and mind altering music in spite of the lack of violence or maybe just because of it the film is genuinely disturbing and the mental agony alice goes through honestly affects the viewer emotionally as well as it is sadly too often the case in gialli cinema the climax suddenly comes rather abrupt and nearly doesn't give a explanation of all the awkward events you just witnessed for the last hour and a half still the content of footprints will keep you contemplating long after the film has finished and its powerful impact will only increase florinda bolkan is sublime as the tormented leading lady and receives excellent feedback from the limited supportive cast including the young the eminent euro cult star klaus kinski receives top billing as well but his role is merely an extended cameo this film is actually a lot better than director more acclaimed and much easier available giallo the fifth cord so here's to hoping footprints will soon receive a fancy dvd release as well
<START> it must be said that the director of the cell singh has quite handily established himself with his first feature which happens to rank as one of the most visually astounding films in contemporary cinema br br the cell is more of a visceral experience than a film as a thriller it rises above most of its peers with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere however it is ultimately skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the film's jolting sense of terror br br as with several recent films i have been shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively about the cell in defence of the film i will address a few of these issues the plot appears to be the main concern and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from the silence of the lambs it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film the plot itself is a vehicle through which vision simultaneously horrifying and wondrous is presented to the audience much in the same way that the plot of the silence of the lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two lead characters lecter and starling while the silence of the lambs is clearly the superior film it is irrational for one to condemn the plot of the cell and in the same breath praise that of the silence of the lambs br br my final concern is the mention of mtv style directing it pains me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques a camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool with which to record events angles pans colour adjustment and so forth are all used to their full extent in the cell with the purpose of creating the sense of a dream like state that could not have been otherwise achieved this is essential to the film as the entire premise behind it is the visualization of a serial killer's subconscious if you simply want a series of static shots stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogether br br that being said the cell is thoroughly entertaining terrifying and breathtaking in both its pacing and design anyone who is able to look past the perhaps uninspired yet never dull screenplay will find one of the best films of the year 2000
<START> i just wanted to leave a quick comment as its not listen on here but i have just seen this movie the version i just rented was released in 2005 as far as i know and it was actually called don't go into the attic i only realized it was the same movie as devils harvest upon searching for some of the actors who looked familiar in the movie anyways i'm in ireland so maybe this has only been released over here and in the uk now but thats what its called over here not really like it matters because i would not recommend this movie the only words that spring to mind watching it are cheese cheese cheese my one mark out of ten is purely for the one little jumpy bit o
<START> oh my god why did i waste my precious time on this film it is pathetic waaaay ott and unrealistic and one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life yes my life i am embarrassed for yash raj films the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes they produced this terrible film br br this is by far the most trashy sexual eyebrow raising movie i have ever seen by yash raj films i cringe for them i really do along with the terrible acting or no acting for that matter by chopra combined with the lack of talent of the look at my boobs neal 'n' nikki has not one good thing about it at all even the music is not upto the standard left by the director arjun did an embarrassingly bad job here br br honestly i expected more much much more
<START> one way or the other you can't get away from the basic message the strong survive those who are psychically or emotionally sensitive leave they leave a hole behind in the lives of those who love them a hole that is seen in it's finality as selfish that's what phoebe realizes in the end just prior to helping wolf heal from his self blame she can accept closure to the missing of her sister beautiful european scenery a lot of truth in it about idealism and addiction to the next big moment for a moment i thought of the gang who was around in the early 70s i liked this movie as it reflected a time when i came of age myself
<START> not a bad concept i just wish they had taken it in another direction its a movie that tries to be interesting by shocking you with bestiality to begin with which works for most people with weak stomachs but besides this there's not much to this movie its not funny nor is it romantic so please somebody change that label and since i already knew that bestiality is actually legal most places and a million dollar industry i wasn't really shocked but most people do not know this and i thought that how the movie evolved after the secret came out was just disappointing because it could have been one of those shocking eye opener movies that would teach the ignorant about a fetish that is very much a reality for yes i did my homework hundreds of thousands of people so if you like watching bad movies that you can daydream about how you could make them better while watching them than sure have fun doing that
<START> de or the green butchers as it is called in english is a very dark comedy about two losers who work for a popular butcher they are fed up with their bosses criticism and decide to start a business on their own their shop is expensive and it doesn't even have electricity all over the place and to make things worse they haven't got any customers as their former boss predicted when the man pays them a visit in their shop he challenges them to provide the meat for a dinner party he organizes br br than a tragic accident happens one of the butchers locks the electrician into the freezing chamber when he closes the shop the man dies and the neurotic one of the two butchers decides to cut out of the thigh and serves it to the dinner party instead of calling the police it's an incredible success all at once every person in the village wants to taste that incredible chicken overwhelmed by his sudden success the butcher sees no other option but to kill more people who he can sell as chicken br br i guess that the subject cannibalism may not be enjoyed by everyone especially not because it is shown with a lot of humor personally i liked it a lot it shows perfectly how far some people would go for some social acceptance and to get out of their isolation it may sound a bit far fetched but i'm sure you would be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act br br next to the original subject i was also pleased by the actors' performances and the humor there is no overacting as you might expect in this kind of movies it's all very sober and realistic i guess that's typical for the and scandinavian movies the same for the humor i'm sure i wouldn't have liked it as much as i did now if the humor had been over the top or with a lot of farting vomiting like you see so often in american movies i loved this movie and i give it an 8 10
<START> the movie was very good i'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn't figure out who did it i wasn't happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that please know that while these poirot movies are good they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have japp ms lemon and especially hastings david suchet is definitely poirot i have seen every actor who's played him the worst was peter ustinov
