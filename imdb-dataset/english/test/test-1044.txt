<START> i saw two hands back in sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all time favourite films it's got action adventure comedy and romance all rolled up into one and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure like much australian film the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging and jordan should justly feel proud of his work br br anyway it was on tv just now on channel 4 in london and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie but indeed any movie had been cut out so if you watch this movie make sure it's the original version
<START> and my reasons for which are simple there are so many great films presented and discussed here most of them by their own directors and stars so many clips of infamous moments in 70's movie history and in fact a number of films i have yet to see that it wouldn't be fair to grade this work by this logic i shouldn't have given grades to other movie documentaries like martin scorsese's personal journey through american movies and my voyage to italy but while those films were on the basis of one man's view of cinema narrating through most of the way richard and the late ted a decade under the influence lets the films and the creators speak entirely for themselves br br what makes worth at least one watch for film buffs or just anyone who likes the films of the late 60's 70's in america are the levels that it goes to that in the uncut version three hours not the theatrical version which i have no comment on plenty of ground is covered interviews include the likes of scorsese robert altman sidney lumet julie christie jon voight francis ford coppola paul schrader pam grier bruce dern peter bogdanovich roger corman dennis hopper robert towne etc and there's a constant flow of insight from start to finish the way the clips and directors actors pop up edited together in a flashy and quick style is also fascinating br br the one down comment i have on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported on in various books like easy riders raging bulls and though i haven't seen the movie version of that book yet i'm sure it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents as here in fact the book of that is one of the best i've ever read however this documentary serves as something special for film buffs and occasional movie goers of the future they can look at this and learn not only about such well known pictures as easy rider the last picture show annie hall coming home and lessor knowns like scarecrow panic in needle park the landlord joe they shoot horses don't they they can also learn about who influenced them new waves of europe and asia who they served as influences for and how the subject matter that created controversy after controversy still serves as intriguing and chancy material for the contemporary crowd seek this out
<START> is truly one of those shows that just has it all great acting great cast great writing sets chemistry muppets it's got it all and then some except a home this fantastic series it's seem has it all except and ending seem to think this is a series that is consecutive single set shows when anyone who watches know this is an ongoing one epic love story that has an end that must been seen if you have never watched farscape do a favor and check it out on dvd when the season 1 will be released in october and season 2 is the best there is watch the reruns on the scifi channel to catch up and then the new season starts in january through march when most shows are going in to and be sure to watch if all goes well we will get our ending
<START> when hulk hit theaters in 2003 it wasn't long before dvds of the old incredible hulk tv show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze we saw a similar occurrence a year prior when spider man cartoons appeared on dvd to coincide with that hero's big screen debut companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand br br so the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of wal mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot i guess everyone involved would just rather forget to be fair the fantastic four is not as bad as everyone says let me rephrase that it's not as unentertaining as all of its negative reviews might suggest br br veteran television actor alex hyde white no you don't remember any of his roles leads the way as reed richards the brilliant scientist who along with his crew gains bizarre powers after an outer space mishap he's left with the ability to stretch and contort his body to outrageous lengths his future wife sue storm rebecca can suddenly turn invisible while her brother johnny jay underwood may now ignite himself at will then there's poor ben grimm michael bailey smith the lovable lug whose body morphs into a mass of craggy orange rock br br just as the friends are becoming accustomed to all of this they are called upon to rescue the world from certain chaos it seems reed's old colleague victor von doom joseph culp is living up to his name and that villainous ian trigger isn't exactly helping old ladies cross the street either can our heroes save the day of course they can like any superhero movie it's just a question of how and when br br what's striking about the fantastic four is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect the dialog is so lame and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class the acting is so unpolished it makes a third rate afternoon soap opera look like shakespeare the special effects are surprisingly good considering the minuscule budget but there are still some positively embarrassing moments when the human torch fully ignites his body for instance the entire movie briefly turns into a cartoon i can just hear that production meeting oh no one will notice they'll be too intrigued by the action i mean really a cartoon at least give me a mannequin on fire held up by a string prior to that the scene in which the foursome come to on earth after their spaceship crashes is pure teens in the backyard fare the crew simply found a field and lit a vaguely spaceship like object on fire that's the only remnant of such a major disaster br br of course there wasn't a whole lot to work with in the script there is a fairly coherent story here but it's all so simplified when reed and ben decide to go into outer space they simply drop by the house and ask if they'd care to join them is it really that easy don't these sort of things require oh i don't know years of training and expertise not in the world of these writers who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius on display in full house reruns but as bad as that may be nothing can compare to how painfully clichÃ©d dr doom is he was pulled right out of those awful superhero cartoons from the 1960s right down to the evil laugh and slamming his clenched fist down on the table to punctuate his remarks no comic book least of all fantastic four has ever featured a villain so obscenely one dimensional br br ultimately the fantastic four is saved from being a complete turkey because it's just so damn innocent you can tell the people involved as little talent or experience as they had really tried they didn't know the final result would be so embarrassing they were under the impression that this was their big break that people would flock to the theaters it bears repeating that they had virtually no money to work with and i'm sure half of that was eaten up by the cool thing costume all things considered they did well and for its many flaws the finished product is a fair amount of fun for comic book fans
<START> i hate you you hate me barney stole your suv with a great big bunch and a kick from me to you wont you say you hate me too jingle bells batman smells grandma had a gun shot barney and made him pee and now there is no more barney the moron now why the heck would come up with a idiotic show like barney so what i'm saying is barney is a retard from the underground world and the kids on this show are like 12 years old if i were them i wouldn't believe this stupid idiot called barney now producers why do you believe this crap that barney says they are always happy that is stupid they should be sad sometimes am i right bottom line barney is so stupid who watches that ugly creature
<START> the idea for the movie wasn't too bad a horror film shot in a corn maze on halloween the bad part was the shoddy camera work the ten million shots of puddles and corn and the hour and a half long walk this guy took in the maze oh i'm sorry the maize i picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where i live and i thought it was a cool idea for a movie but taking everything into consideration it seems that your average joe could take the same idea and run much further with it bill acting wasn't too bad in fact i would say it was pretty good but the lack of talent from his co stars didn't help his efforts here's to hoping his next movie will be easier to swallow
<START> first off just to say i didn't get the edition i thought i would i chose the italian version over the r2 but what actually arrived was a uk release from 1998 claiming to be a special edition i never knew there was a uk dvd release but the promised were not actually on the disc just a couple of duff trailers anyway as to the film itself just as i was recovering from night train murders my second genital mutilation thriller turns up in the same month this time in an italian uk nubile schoolgirls are being offed and teacher fabio testi unhappily married but nailing one of his students becomes the main suspect joachim fuchsberger is the detective on the case sorry to say i was less than entranced it was watchable but more than equally miss able and aside from the aforementioned gruesome nature of the crime the surprise killing of cristina galbo which was actually spoilt by the dvd cover telling me about it grrrrrr and a surprise twist that cast the victims in a new light i thought this was very routine put me off the two sequels though with karin hannibal brooks baal and camille i spit on your grave keaton
<START> i can't say that i embrace this as a romantic comedy as i found little funny about it i did find it endearing entertaining heartwarming and terminally sweet and while there were some witty moments i found them more bittersweet than outright comedic br br i liked this one barrymore has grown so much as an actress and it's always wonderful to catch her on the big screen but this translates well to the small screen too in fact on subsequent viewings i like this one more and more br br if you're a fan of the romantic comedy then you may be a bit put off by lack of comedic effect with this one but if you're in it for the romance it's definitely here to be found br br it rates a 7 8 10 from br br the fiend
<START> licence fees to watch this trash and pay for it with hard earned cash humourless no hint of laughter god knows how it won a bafta br br we've now been subjected to eastenders for twenty years when oh when is the great british public going to see this awful soap for what it is crass pap this programme no more depicts reality in the east end of london than everyday life in beirut and never has done br br the eastenders i know the real ones are kind courageous hardworking and loyal and one of their greatest attributes is humour it was the eastenders who went through the worst of the london blitz and still stuck two fingers up to hitler and what do we see on our screens for five days of the week including an omnibus nothing but a bunch of moaning wailing dead from the neck up wimps who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other what a great advert for britain that is do the writers actually believe this garbage they're pumping out obviously the woolly minded section of the public does but then i've heard that apparently anyone can be brainwashed into believing anything
<START> this is lucio fulci at his best if only all the films he made after were like this br br this extraordinary film is as intriguing as dario the bird with crystal plumage br br if youÂ´re an argento fan but you donÂ´t like lucio fulci films like br br the beyond manhattan baby the house by the cemetery etc this one has nothing to do with the others this is what the italians call giallo that would be something like a who done it movie in a nutshell br br you wonÂ´t know who the killer is until the last moments of the film br br but apart from that thereÂ´s the plot some maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys a journalist tomas a sexy young woman barbara bouchet a priest marc porel his mother irene papas and a witch florinda bolkan are the main characters in this tangled bloody story br br talking about the actors i want to say that tomas is superb like always and florinda bolkan is terrific as the village witch br br do you want to know who is the killer br br i cannot tell you but i can tell you that you must see this film br br 10 out of 10 of course
<START> the filmmakers apparently had enough money to be able to afford decent makeup effects but not enough for a creature that would move around and attack convincingly we never get a chance to see the monster move from one place to another whenever that happens supposedly the camera focuses on the terrified reactions of the humans that are nearby and when a man is attacked by it he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself so that it won't fall to the ground this is still not the worst alien rip off around the two xtro films are even worse for example it's actually sufficiently entertaining if you've got 68 minutes to spare 1 2
<START> when my parents rented this movie i was expecting a very funny movie as randy quaid is very funny in comedy movies however this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too you can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only eighty one minutes long so i can honestly say it is not a movie that is on my favorites list it may work for some people but it just did not work with me at all proving to be rather slow in the build up with virtually nothing that amused me within the entire movie randy quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland actors and actresses the premise of the movie had potential as did the casting of quaid but all of it just sputters and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary granted the one dream sequence the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly became a whirlpool of blood was very nicely done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure horror instead of one that lists comedy as its first genre
<START> br br i used to think reeves was the worst actor in hollywood i not so sure anymore willy gives some stiff competition with his i'm made of plaster performance in this movie br br combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot and not a single likable character and it's pretty hard to recommend this turkey br br natasha tries her best but even julia roberts couldn't save this flick from obscurity br br avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else on oh heck in that case just read a book
<START> the storyline is a ticked off claim jumper made a deal with the devil to find gold and is forced to protect it forever a bunch of friends find the gold and gets talked by the old miner and they're forced to blow the gold to smithereens in order to send him back to hell br br i mean seriously how did this film not win the oscar for movie of the year what a compelling storyline of late 20 year olds running from a claim jumper straight out of the 1800's i love how in other movies you can't kill the monster but they can knock it out this movie they write the monster as completely indestructible br br the opening of the movie clearly rips off nightmare on elm street part 4 but what the hell not like that movie was a 5 star classic either br br highlight of the movie is when we're introduced to a girl who's never been to school never been out of the town never learned to read or write yet speaks perfect english is smoking hot and wears the latest fashion how did the oscar's miss that br br ok i'm done with the bad jokes this movie is pure crap and only watch it if u have nothing better to do and all the spices on the spice rack are in order already br br 2 out of 10
<START> i got this in the horror six pack from echo bridge home entertainment this one is not the worst movie ever made but it still sucks in fact this movie sucked so hard i don't know how i'm gonna write this review especially since 1 i popped it out of the dvd player because i couldn't even watch another second and 2 hurricane friggin' ike is coming and god knows how long 'til it take for me to get this review done br br the movie starts off with a scientist and his wife the scientist receives a valuable artifact and examines it when this supposedly urban legend known as the skeleton man kills him and later on his wife then br br i'm sorry but there's really not much else i can say about this pos except don't bother i'm currently using the disc as a coaster and if you see this you might want to do the same casper van dien and michael rooker must have needed cash badly br br ps i'll pretty much be reviewing the movies in the boxset and might do a new review on ghoulies iv
