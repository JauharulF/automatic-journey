<START> this is the slowest film noir film i've ever seen very weak script only provides opportunity for jack palance and rod steiger to deliver exceptionally well lines that were made for an acting audition palance and steiger both affirm they are indeed serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power emotion and drama the story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace mostly taking place in a living room the director obviously moved the actors around in a circles as they delivered long lines to keep the slow pace from becoming noticeable to the audience the action doesn't pick up until the last ten minutes of the film if you're one who's looking for more depth in a crime drama this one's not for you
<START> get the cd instead the show is tame and the editing sucks the crowd gets way too much screen time as does till the cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way which leads me to believe it's the exact same shot than they do during richard solo in the scenes change so quickly it's impossible to tell where the camera is pointed and the replays are simply redundant not worth the tape it's recorded on
<START> nice attempt to bring shakespearian language alive in a post apocalyptic setting but the final result is dreadful futuristic liverpool is not convincing at all the budget was obviously not very big but the production designer could have come up with a slightly more creative approach to the matter alex cox has made some good films e g repo man and highway patrol man but i really don't know what he was thinking here just an opinion
<START> den is one of the better films of all time and is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses no feelings no love no truth and definitely no freedom a world where people become afraid when someone speaks their mind expresses himself or show affection a world where no one is free and no one has any idea what the meaning of any of this is just like the world we live in the world in den is a world of lost souls trying to become fulfilled but focus on the complete opposite of what fulfills them materialism social acceptance and mediocre satisfactions br br den deserves full attention by every human soul because we could all use a fresh wake up call
<START> i haven't seen this movie in years the last time i did i was really drunk after 5 pints of tenant's at my local witherspoon's but even then i though it was quite awful this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies the first two were quite good 3 was quite crap but miles better than this the story takes place 53 years after 3 were charlie the bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a pod in outer space by a crew of some kind of space miner em people and taken on board once on board the last critter eggs left in the galaxy which charlie has brought with him from earth crack open and we then have critters on board the space ship cue an obvious 'alien' rip off and a lot of terrible fx and you pretty much have this movie in a nutshell only good thing is when we are re introduced to ug or so we are lead to believe who is now a villain and wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying them
<START> this show is verging on brilliant it's a modern day married with children the scripts are witty as they are sprinkled with clever sarcasm they are also realistic dealing with issues that face many parents of teenagers today as well as the on going burden that you might not be the worlds greatest parent and how is the best way to deal with this however at the same time it manages to remain light hearted and fun which with all the drama and action on television these days is a very pleasant and welcome change it is something you can sit down in front of for 30 minutes and relax laugh and relate to it isn't the world's most hilarious comedy yet will make you laugh at least a handful of times an episode michael rapaport is brilliant in the lead as dave he fills the big shoes that the heavily sarcastic script requires and then some he and anita barone vikki have fantastic chemistry and bounce off one another very well this show has a strong future if it is marketed at the correct target audience and put in the right time slot also if fox release it on dvd the following will be stronger and larger as is a classic example with scrubs
<START> this movie is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to businesses ty hackett columbus short was in iraq for the war serving his country and now just is being helped out making a living by his friend mike matt dillon making sure he does not loose his house mike tells him that this wasn't the life his parents were expecting for him and he should be living a better life than he is now with his brother jimmy hackett andre telling ty that him and jimmy have always been family to him and would do anything to help them out mike tells ty about a plan to make a heist the money would be around 43 million split six ways among the other transport men too although ty does not like the idea he tells his friend mike as long as no one gets hurt he would be in the last night ty was forced to talk to a welfare lady about putting up his brother in foster care giving him a dilemma to lose what matters most in his life although the plan sounds safe at first greed isn't everything when it comes to taking lives br br when it comes to heists your either in or your out so when you don't go with a plan its hard to play the hero and stop greed driven people when it comes to having large sums of money this movie comes with a star studded cast to keep you interested starring jean reno laurence fishburne fred ward skeet ulrich and milo ventimiglia short i have recently only remembered him in stomp the yard which was about a kid who lost his brother and lives his dream to go to college this was probably one of his best movies i have seen him in and this one he fits the character so well it's great to see him on the big screen again in action
<START> despite the fact that the plot follows the well known recipe of who did it which has characterised all the perry mason movies so far the characters of the present film are not so well developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood of course in general the perry mason movies are not significant but even for their low standards this one is weak
<START> this comic classic of english school girl antics is and was one of the great art house classics then the art house disappeared with the arrival of videos and so did the audience for this movie the loss is not to the art houses or to this great film the loss is to those who will never have a real opportunity to view this memorable laugh filled cinematic masterpiece but i am preaching to the converted aren't i who else would search for this flick
<START> this begrudging and angry film is against not just the war during which it was made but all war it doesn't care what war it is it might be the most emotionally involving experience i have ever had with ingmar bergman's work there are no sides to the two main characters in this impacting drama which doesn't intimate a point in any ceremonial symbolism as per bergman's usual but plainly showcases people and their lives and exercises what bergman has already proved he understands about a person's reaction to a movie br br his top drawer regulars liv and max von sydow play an but bickering married couple who were once orchestra musicians now they live in a weathered farm house on an island part of the building frustration we grow to share with these two people in the detail that nothing in their house seems to work they are not reclusive intellectuals either they are a rather familiar marriage that has more or less resigned from life and is essentially apolitical they only get wind of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever is concerned with the danger to their lives and to her desire to bear children her husband von sydow shrugs off that the war will pass them by their serenity is interrupted by screaming fighter planes flying low over their house the killing of a parachuting airman the arrival of dubious troops their inquisition and eventually their capture by what appears to be the local side but loyalties have long since splintered br br they are sent back to their home witness gratuitous destruction and suffer the vindictive consequences of such an agonizingly distrustful marriage this one of my top favorite bergman efforts is a study of a couple jarred from their safely self unaware lives and violated by a manipulative despair testing them both to reveal who they really are she lacks compassion to some extent too self serving and restless to have any patience for his capricious breakdowns into crying his suppressed emotional issues have led to the repression of the very initiative and excitement that attracted them to begin with the immense last twenty minutes sporadically interrupted by images of the overwhelming gray sky are among the closest to real emotion that bergman ever filmed br br all systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists in this very essential and downbeat portrait the basically clearcut personalities of and von sydow's characters are hurled into the degenerate world of war because they are accused of being sympathizers but the film shot on bergman's small home island of doesn't give any information about where or when it's set who the two sides are and for what they're fighting to an uninvolved civilian caught in between the knowledge base is likely to be quite similar br br and von sydow are not sympathizers for the apparent enemy but they're partisans for who are apparently their side this 1968 reactive allegory could be about the common citizens of iraq or kosovo or vietnam or israel or palestine or
<START> oh sex lives of the potato men what foul demon created thee this is a film that you watch smirk a little during the runtime and then when you mention it to others having seen it you just cannot help but smile as you talk but it's not that sex lives of the potato men is actually a funny film and one that inspires you to smile when talking or thinking about it it's just that the film is so bizarre is so insulting and is no shameless in its attempt to get across a meek laugh to do with sex and sex lives in general that you just cannot help but have your mouth break out into a grin do bear in mind that what follows the smirk is a sinking of the head a consequent shake of the head and a raise of the index finger and thumb to both eyebrows as you gently rub them in an attempt to reminisce about your time watching this trash br br but that's what the film is it's trash it's very brave and shameless trash but trash none the less whoever came up with this idea put it to paper and then spread it around the industry trying to get it made must either be very brave or very desperate it's strange to have a film that is most definitely something but one that does not have under any sort of circumstance a decisive narrative this follows on from that idea that most of european cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open ended and themes take precedence over most other things in sex lives of the potato men the same situation and technically the same joke are replayed over and over again and that is an that consists of 'sex is a very very funny thing ' these ideas are perhaps more suited to an american film so it's no wonder that after a while watching this film things start to feel a little out of sorts br br the film begins and ends in the same manner creating a feeling of a circular journey a circular journey that has gone absolutely nowhere and absolutely nothing has been achieved three blokes sit around a table talking and what not their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to whatever crude and disgusting stories situations or scenarios each can possibly think of the odd thing here being that whenever one man says something nasty the other grimaces but has an equally filthy story to give in return creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not the men are dave vegas and ferris crook two people joined by coleman whenever the film sees fit to throw in a third face to crack some more nasty sex jokes or break some peculiar stories they are employed by jeremy a man who has deeper issues and problems but issues of which the film is more concerned with exploiting for the sake of humour rather than study br br so what's the situation in sex lives of the potato men the three to four men are in a crisis and for the duration of the film we will adopt the role of the hapless fly on the wall as we witness what foul play these people get up to over the period of about a week if the humour revolving around dave and ferris is disgusting and repulsive then for jeremy things are just spooky it all begins rather innocently and it appears there is a female he likes and one who equally likes him in return but when the essence that jeremy is merely a stalker creeps in that's when the jaws drop the character of jeremy is used and put across in a way that makes unrequited love and stalking in general merely look 'funny' jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing out letters of abuse to ruth davis echoing some sort of psychotic persona more associated with hannibal lecter writing his to clarice in 2001's hannibal but whatever sympathy we might have for him at this point is rendered absolutely false when later on it is revealed the true origin of their relationship suddenly we as an audience feel cheated into feeling a mite sorry for him earlier on and for whatever reason he did do what he did in the first place just seems cowardly and distasteful to say what it was would ruin whatever few surprises lurk within the film br br quite sad how in one of jeremy's letters he writes about something or other exclaiming it to have no artistic vision Â just one big mess i hate it when words said by the characters echo the film they're in sex lives of the potato men does not explore someone's psyche or particular interest in a fetish or why they feel the need to go around having as much sex as possible it just uses them as a front to pile on ridiculously unfunny jokes and situations rather than take group sex and explore what drives a person to seek it down it makes a daft joke out of it tickets with numbers on rather than get into the mindset of a fan of sadomasochism the film has someone hang from a basement ceiling and warn everyone of salt and as he climaxes ferris covers his face in disgust and the camera fades to the next scene without too much of a fuss it's a relief the film got to no audiences abroad this is one section of british culture indeed of the british mentality that i pray will be confined to our shores and ignored accordingly
<START> well that's what this should have been called anyway mainly due the the ridiculous ham fisted use of what can barely be called symbolism by the director it would not have surprised me to find out that this was a one of lea earliest efforts and b at least semi autobiographical turns out a is wrong although i don t know about b i will bet she attended boarding school though and had a rather terrible same sex relationship of some kind this is the message that was beat down our throats by this film and the short film which preceded it the name of which i no longer recall br br at any rate the character development was clumsy who introduces herself by saying what her name means nobody the symbols were about as subtle as an all glass elevator full of teen age girls losing a cable and plummeting eighty stories all over a loudspeaker honestly the cry of a falcon when perabo declared she was a raptor and leapt off the table that was ridiculous to the point of parody and it was only one of far too many symbols meant to show even the dumbest of viewers what her point was and that was that she had a crappy childhood and feels the need to make movies about it ala vincent gallo instead of seeing a therapist ala all of us who get on with our lives there was nothing tender nothing sweet and nothing moving about this film it was poorly enacted trash and the actors could not save the brett over the top hey this is my point in this movie use of film techniques writing and acting sorry but it was terrible
<START> spoilers for the first ten minutes or so of star witness we're introduced to a quote typical urban american family unquote in a nameless city which is another way of saying warner brothers' version of nyc except for the young children including the charming dickie moore and sprightly sally blane they're a pretty dreary lot and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out drawing the family in against their will and after that this baby never lets up there's suspense an oscar nominated script good acting everything you want old movies to is here i do question chic sales performance he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot he's treated to special status in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me perhaps it is lost to time period an unknowable factor you had to be a 1931 moviegoer to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far however i've only seen eight so perhaps that's an inconclusive view do not miss this when tcm shows it 8 out of 10
<START> this movie is a real waste of time and effort the film lacks plot and depth the visuals are decent but nothing to write home about there are far better films out there
<START> an insult to both poker and cinema this movie manages to make the most dynamic brilliant and fascinating figure in poker history into an utter bore still a fun film to make jokes about from the lame gangster movie clichÃ©s of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour hilariously stu ungar wins all three of his world series titles without playing a single hand on screen his infamous dealer abuse 1 scene his coke habit 1 scene his incredible memory 0 scenes they couldn't even get any real poker players what did they cover a lot of high angle shots from inside a house in the suburbs oh and a montage of stu waking up every day and shopping for meat which doesn't come anywhere close to making sense why do i care so much about this little sopranos summer camp trying to cash in on the poker craze because i think there's still a great film to be made about stu ungar waiting for someone willing to do it right
