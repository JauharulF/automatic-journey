<START> synopsis correction the ending does not show ben cruising online for guys he is looking up arabic language courses at the military acadamy in san francisco perhaps to join the war in iraq as a translator fyi many of the dishonorable discharges from ask tell have been translators they are now it major short supply ben also spoke russian this movie is a good time capsule of life in manhatten but quite a bit of non reality here mostly a good laugh at lame social skills and the sad portrayal of grown up twenty somethings not developing beyond the college party mode also a brief study of the always changing scene in manhatten somehow it always stays close to the edge of the same b s br br watch together the films englishman in new york and the the new twenty both good for nostalgia i think the movie twenty shows how far the blur between gay and straight as evolved br br these two films are gay time travel for sure enjoy
<START> martha plimpton has done some prestigious movies working with river phoenix and harrison ford but she was never able to expand her limited tomboyish appeal into the same class as say molly ringwald this film which was barely released is just an extension of her late '80s early '90s attempts to find a screen persona which was identifiable to moviegoers and it represents another failure plimpton plays a troubled young woman who finds out on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and worse than that was actually abandoned as an infant on her parents' doorstep she sets out to find her biological mother and father but the viewer has no clue why she'd even want to would simple curiosity give her this much determination unattractive material given sitcom handling it starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers plimpton gives a sour surly performance but hector elizondo and mary kay place are fine as her adoptive parents 1 2 from
<START> of all the 48 films of brigitte bardot une parisienne is widely regarded as one of her best what we see is special for once the plot has a value of its own does much more than only providing a cheap vehicle for sex charged appearance br br this film is your true well worked out light comedy with a good and coherent story set in france's government circles in the late 1950's it entertains from beginning to end providing many amusing twists turns and some slapstick all acted out by at least three starring leads including bardot br br une parisienne french for female inhabitant of paris focuses on telling a story not on showing brigitte bardot brigitte serves the plot very well by using her talent for acting in light comedies br br when you settle on your couch on a friday night tired and weary from a week's slaving away just turn on une parisienne this film will make you feel better
<START> i haven't seen this film in years but the awful taste of quaid's performance still lingers on my tongue some have commented on how quaid has jerry lee lewis to a tee but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage jerry in mind nobody acts that way all the time and the performance comes off as hopelessly clownish reducing lewis to a buffoonish caricature the nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of sheer over acting br br the author of the book this is based on nick is a good writer who has written several fine musical bios i particularly liked dino on dean martin in the books gives us a full human being both separate from and involved in the biz quaid's acting seems to imply that jerry never acted like a human being if people were like this no one would bother to hang around them as cartoons go it is mildly amusing but otherwise it is one of the most egregious film destroying performances i have had the honor of viewing terrible
<START> david morse and andre braugher are very talented actors which is why i'm trying so hard to support this program unfortunately an irrational plot and very poor writing is making it difficult for me i'm hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them
<START> i know we shouldn't expect much from a low budget indie film but the idea behind it is sound an attempt to open america's eyes to the cozy relationship between the government and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it but somehow the documentary aspect of it takes away from its drama the protests during the 2004 republican convention in new york were not that compelling to make a documentary about it those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's br br it would have been better to stick to a drama format perhaps a slow build up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy
<START> i think this movie is my favorite movie i am not sure why but it is julia duffy has been my favorite actress for awhile and when i saw this i went crazy it's sort of romantic and i definitely recommend this movie
<START> think of the most un film worthy subject you can and this is 10 times worse a woman needs to complete as many as she can in a day we don't even get to see the questions and think of the words on our own we just watch her struggle the woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the but for some reason she spends the time distractedly walking all around the city when she could be focused at home the acting is horrible the actress huffs and puffs as she tried to think of the words and we are left completely in the dark the new york scenery is nice but the movie relies on it too much and it gets old fast the movie plays like a rejected nyu student film this film has no redeeming qualities and i do not recommend it to anyone ever
<START> i was very disappointed with this series it had lots of cool graphics and that's about it the level of detail it went into was minimal and i always got the feeling the audience was being there was a lot of what seemed to me as this is extremely cool but we're not going to explain it in further detail because you won't get it anyway let's just show you some pretty pictures to entertain you the host would drop interesting sounding words such as and super symmetry without any attempt at explaining what it was we had to look it up on wikipedia br br furthermore i know quite a bit about for a layman and i found their explanations were convoluted and could have been so much better they could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts but instead the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject br br additionally i got so sick of the repetitiveness they could easily have condensed the series into one episode if they had cut out all the repetition they must have shown the clips of the quantum cafÃ© about 8 times the host kept saying the same things over and over and over again i can't remember how many times he said the universe is made out of tiny little vibrating strings it's like they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting are the best thing since sliced bread br br finally the show ended off with an unpleasant sense of a competition between and clearly biased towards this is supposed to be an educational program about quantum physics not about whether the us is better than europe or vice versa i also felt that was part of the patronizing audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested please give me a little more credit than that br br overall 2 thumbs down
<START> first off this film will not be for everybody there are scenes of extreme graphic violence and disturbing images that by their nature alone will turn off many possible potential viewers obviously from the reviews on this board subconscious cruelty has divided those that have seen it i'm among the ones who liked it very much for several different reasons i feel this was a very ambitious and quite competently pulled off undertaking for a bunch of 18 19 year olds with no budget and little experience i think that each aspect of the film the direction the acting though the character's performances are more likened to stage or free form performance because of the nature of the film the production the fx the score sound design all are far superior to many films i've seen that exceed these kids budget and experience ten fold i honestly haven't been this impressed with an art house style horror film since nacho genesis br br first off i'm not going to pretend to understand and or grasp all of the graphical content in this film but knowing that this wasn't a straight narrative type of film when i went into it i wasn't disappointed with how it played out subconscious cruelty is 4 relatively short vignettes that all sort of revolve around the theory of right brain left brain lust anger psychosis vs restraint compassion normalcy to very briefly give a synopsis of each chapter br br eyeball basically just has a naked girl who has an eyeball cut out of her abdomen i'm sure it's symbolic of something i don't think i was paying that much attention at that point and this one blows by pretty quick br br the next episode human larvae is a nihilistic horrific genuinely creepy story of a guy who's both in love with and repulsed by his pregnant sister who gives into his growing psychosis which leads up to the shocking conclusion of that particular chapter human larvae is the best of the bunch in my book and will probably get under your skin the dead pan narrative dialog accentuates the growing tension as you know something horrible is going to happen but you're not quite sure what it is do yourself a favor and if you are interested in seeing this film don't do too much research on it come into it with an open mind and an iron stomach and i think you be pleasantly surprised especially with this particular episode br br rebirth has a bunch of people in a field screwing the ground and blowing trees and stuff apparently an arty interpretation of the rape of the earth or something to that effect not bad but this one is pretty short too and i sorta missed the point on it br br and right brain martyrdom seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also along with human larvae has some of the hardest images messages of the whole feature br br eyeball isn't anything to write home about mainly because of it's very short running time but does make a decent segue into the insanity to come and rebirth is also kind of short and not quite as thought provoking but human larvae especially and right brain martyrdom are so off the wall and well done that they more than make up for the other parts i think the main reason that i liked this one so much is that as shocking repulsive violent and excessive as it is it is also done very beautifully and you can tell this was a real labor of love from those involved nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed and even if the content isn't completely decipherable it's undeniably original and that alone up's the points some in my book not that every weird art house film that has an unintelligible plot should be praised for it's originality but subconscious cruelty is the type of film that i do think i'll watch a few more times in the near future to see what other interpretations i may gain from it again this film is absolutely not for everyone with some very extreme scenes of gore murder rape incest sacrilegious imagery etc that is definitely there to shock the viewer into taking a harder look at this film i have to say it worked for me and i'm anxiously awaiting the collaboration that is rumored to come next check this one out if you have the stomach for it 9 5 10
<START> lame rip off of the quatermass xperiment 1955 the first half is deadly dull even dreary but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging 'monster' in the accompanying featurette a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes when compared to the ones created for the other titles in criterion's monsters madmen set director day who admits to not being a fan of the sci fi genre tries to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero budget to work with where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage and i'd have been inclined to be more lenient with the film had i not recently watched the immortal monster 1959 a similar and similarly threadbare but far more stylish venture from italy br br bill edwards as the cocky but unlucky astronaut obsessed with achieving the titular feat is positively boring at first but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood marshall thompson as his commanding officer and elder brother is o k as a leaner glenn ford type he had previously starred in fiend without a face 1958 another and more successful richard gordon produced sci fi which incidentally is also available on dvd through criterion italian starlet marla struggling with the english language makes for an inadequate female lead even her input in the featurette proves to be of little lasting value br br the audio commentary is yet another enjoyable tom weaver richard gordon track where among many things the fact that first man into space was intended as a double feature with corridors of blood 1958 is brought up but it was eventually put out as a standalone release so as to exploit the topical news value of the current space race it's also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by who tragically died in a traffic accident prior to the film's release weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time when he was involved in the production of the dvd featurette shot by of all people ex cult ish film maker norman j warren who by then had become a lady of title was still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several flights of stairs edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featurette but once in london he proved reluctant to co operate with weaver eventually the latter learned that the actor had been recently diagnosed with cancer and in fact he died in 2002
<START> the way i found out about this movie was when i watched american pie 2 at the start it had a trailer for ali g i watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the dvd it looked incredibly funny so the next day i went to my local store and picked it up for Â£3 99 bargain the film is about ali g who is a gangster of the west massive crew who's rivals are the east massive crew ali has a cub scout pack of children where he teaches them how to survive in the ghetto by teaching them how to swear and steal cars after ali finds out the government are stopping the money coming to the leisure centre where ali teaches the kids he runs for mp for and overthrows another mp in his attempts to get rid of the leisure centre to make room for an airport in throughout the film there are laughs aplenty as ali gets up to some crazy stuff borat makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film too this is a definite must watch film for all you sacha baron cohen fans out there
<START> widow hires a psychopath as a handyman sloppy film noir thriller which doesn't make much of its tension promising set up 3 10
<START> i have seen three other movies that are worse than this one plan 9 from outerspace side hackers and the dreaded blair witch project there are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isn't believable br br let's start with an train with no skirts or handrails between cars the killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train br br in one scene a killer sneaks into a woman's apartment he wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her so what does he do he turns up her stereo if i heard my stereo suddenly get louder i'd be concerned he kills the women by throwing an electric hair into the tub i was amazed to see that an electric hair with a five foot cord could be tossed ten feet and remain plugged in plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted br br the boeing 747 is one of the most well known commercial airliners on the planet so this part really amazed me first the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it wasn't on the top deck of the plane i watched in utter amazement as the pilot and co pilot where was the flight engineer walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward the nose of the airplane br br i was also amazed that bullets wouldn't penetrate an aluminum serving cart good thing for our hero or bathroom doors but would penetrate the ceiling causing a fuel leak that exited through a small hole in the fuselage huh watching three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing as well br br i didn't check was this a movie of the week or something it was terrible
<START> out of all the mafia movies i have ever seen this is one of the best for many reasons the acting from pesci cortese and vincent the story is one of the best ever in the mafia genre as it realistic the characters are people that lots of other people can relate to this movie is also great as it's dialogue is good it also has very realistic fights and action scenes this movie also launched the careers of pesci and vincent if it weren't for the success of this film casino and goodfellas might not have been as good as they were br br story 10 10 acting 9 10 realism 10 10 br br overall 10 10 br br my fave mafia movies are br br 1 goodfellas 2 casino 3 the godfather trilogy 4 family enforcer the death collector 5 the sopranos i know it isn't a movie
