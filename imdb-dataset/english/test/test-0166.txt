<START> close but no cigar that's what my opinion of this film is tag purvis both wrote and directed this script which should have gone through a re write before shooting at times laughable because or a corny script this film's shining star is dan jr and the director of photography both of these talents are ones to watch out for in the future my recommendation is to wait until it hits your local cable station and use the rental money on a classic
<START> i don't normally write reviews in fact i never write reviews this film was so atrocious it actually inspired me to start virtual sexuality attempts to be a light hearted and cheeky teenage comedy regarding the usual trappings virginity boys etc except the main character apparently turns into her perfect boy that she has created using the help of a machine at a technology fair br br sound interesting well it isn't the acting is the most half hearted and appalling i have ever seen the unfortunate thing is they appear to be genuinely supportive of script and movie which probably explains why i have never seen them in any memorable production since i have not bothered to learn the actors names nor their characters the lady does not enrapture or charm you and thus you do not care for her whatsoever the leading lady's male friend raises no sympathy even when the script is screaming for you to pity him the only rise he will get out of you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence the only half decent actor was the blonde leading man who despite his miserably weak role really gave it all he could which wasn't much in the light of such a horrendous piece of work i will not even talk about the acting abomination that are the 'bad guys' of the plot but then again what plot br br i watched this film unfold incredulously as i had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the foolish audacity to write such a script nevermind produce act in and direct it i can only wonder the only reason my companion and i continued to watch such a mangled example of film was the disbelieving laughter it managed to arise out of us as cohesion logic class and even impotent storyline were disregarded within half an hour into the film i have completely no idea why anyone wanted to violate the movie industry by releasing this to the public this is a joke of a film and is best left to gather dust in warehouses for the rest of eternity 1 2 out of 10 if that
<START> reading the other comments here at the imdb i had very high expectations before seeing of the i wasn't disappointed and giving the movie an 8 i would say that i can justify that grade br br the movie has some incredible acting especially by the main person pall the supporting actors are also doing a very good job like the patients in the mental institution the parents and the siblings of pall the music is also worth mentioning supporting the movie throughout giving depth and feeling br br although the movie is very scandinavian it doesn't leave out some humour and has a sort of objective authorship about life still if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light weight this is not for you it is a story about people with mental problems about the way they are being dealt with in society but most of all a story about pall br br i recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs it is one of the best movies that has ever come out of iceland if not out of scandinavia
<START> i thought this was a beautiful movie very brave such beautiful imagery and i liked the use of breaking glasses w applause also how the best friend repeated the line about and she's one year older than me showed that their friendship has and grown but maybe some competition is left i loved the footage of hands feeling the fabric the dance concert was beautiful the beginning seemed slow though it took awhile to feel for the characters the husband could have been more abusive he just seemed absent so when other characters talked about him it didn't really fit the affair the best friend and husband seemed random the doctors meeting seemed to hint that there was not much time left to live so when the infidelity was revealed i didn't feel as much sympathy for the character more like relief the ending was so great the lines her and the husband and the scene where she is pulled over is brilliant
<START> in the 50's a gay photographer called bob mizer daniel founded an agency of male models releasing a muscle magazine called physique pictorial and movie of men and many of the models became prostitutes beefcake shows the rise and fall of this pervert br br alternating footages from the 50's testimony of many models and bob mizer himself in the present days the director thom fitzgerald used this subterfuge to show naked men and lots of penis along 93 minutes running time in a complete bad taste and very silly crap i have never heard anything about this morally corrupt bob mizer and i do not know what amg is in my opinion only gay and very specific audiences might like the theme of this boring and pretentious movie my vote is two br br title brazil carne fresh meat
<START> while this movie is not the most entertaining in the world i think it is better than most over all i mean it had it's little laughs and just all around a good feeling it's not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes walter and jack had such a great chemistry together as friends brother in laws just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not for their age they still had game d i loved just the whole plot of being able to move on and having fun no matter how old you are i'd recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one br br 7 10
<START> sergei eisenstein's most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time the story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 does have the feeling of soviet propaganda but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt the scene on the odessa steps should remain seared into anyone's mind br br okay so the battleship potemkin wasn't actually the first movie to use montage but they did a great job with it here certainly any film history class should show this movie it's a great historical drama although i will admit that i don't know how accurate it is a 10 10 br br oh and we should have learned by now that potemkin should be transliterated as potyomkin
<START> i saw this movie yesterday and like most wrote i also expected a steven movie god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous in had a little doubts cause i read that ja rule was playing in it but i thought hopefully they give him a role so i don't get irritations by watching him and offcourse the opposite happend steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a crew like this steven was broke and needed cash bah what a big dissapointment if you like steven movie pleaseee skip this one its pure drama you only get a few special effects that made me vote 3 10 but the acting of ja rule screws up the whole movie for his buddy kurupt with his irritating hood talk br br my beer went from tasting fresh to water we do the dishes in the story didn't had any good about it to me it felt like a 3 year old produced it br br hopefully steven makes me happy again in a future movie people this isn't even worth renting as that br br to bad and pitty
<START> three children are born at the exact same time during a lunar eclipse just before their 10th birthday they embark on a killing spree bloody birthday is a typical slasher from early 80's it's a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudity the evil children never generate any menace and there is almost no suspense there is also no gore or scares in bloody birthday but the film is mildly entertaining unfortunately no real explanation is provided for the kids sudden homicidal mania the murder scenes are quite gruesome for example we've got death by handgun baseball bat skipping rope and shovel so if you're a fan of early 80's slasher movies give this one a look
<START> the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process it's car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by edward norton for norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as the score mark wahlberg and charlize theron deserve better scripts warning if you've seen the trailer then you have seen the movie if you're looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job
<START> ok so i gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really cool little did i know that the only cool thing about this clichÃ© driven turd was precisely its trailer br br at the cinema i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself no way this movie is so bad don't be an idiot give it a chance you've only seen 3 minutes while i rolled my eyes in shame all those frames showed get this a guy with a poker face because he feels nothing that's deep looking straight at the camera in the middle of the frame in the second or third one he stays awake in his perfectly made bed because he sleeps like a dead guy cause he feels nothing and his father calls and says john garden state is me your father oh come on i've seen a little more than a couple flicks to hate clichÃ©s such as the is me your insert parent how the hell am i supposed to react oh he has a tough relationship with him uh yeah thats exactly how i'm supposed to react br br man this is a crappy movie br br anywho as the flick goes on we learn things about his friends of which everyone is a alternative emo walking indie movie for example one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant who speaks klingon bizarre characters pop culture your standard american indie flick then we know natalie portman's character who is a copy of jones from a movie that kicks butt chasing amy amelie and that chick from eternal sunshine you know smart original not really cultured beautiful and in touch with her sexuality she listens some '70s band named the shins and gives what they're from this damn decade then why do they sound like that oh they have no personality ok so she hands her cd player to john garden state and he looks at her with a dumb face you know love as the song played on i heard its lyrics saying you will love this soundtrack it is so alternative and cool you will love this movie it will define you and your generation even if it is a ideological of the breakfast club ghost world and every other smart teen movie from the last 20 years you will drink coffee and read books you don't understand br br by now really unoriginal sh t starts to happen he doesn't care if he dies in a airplane crash because he is already dead and he feels nothing and he lets us know in a scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called fight club it is a cool scene but oh did i mentioned it appeared in the trailer then in some party and just when you think this guy is really deep and asexual he makes out with a bimbo so oh he's not such a emotional zombie after all clever character development or just a sh tty movie well lets analyze that scene it features him sitting motionless in a couch with everyone else moving in really fast speed scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called requiem from a dream so just a sh tty sh tty movie br br then they meet more eccentric clichÃ© actually characters and finally one that lives next to a big hole in the ground john garden state says some crap like good luck exploring your infinite abyss and the guy says and by now i wanted to really choke myself you too and then we are gently told that neo is jesus oh no wait thats from another dumb obvious repetitive overestimated and clichÃ© piece of crap br br finally finally some more crap happens and he enters the big warehouse showdown to defuse the bombs he has to talk to his dad who he hasn't seen in the last zillion years cause he finally cool spoilers killed his own mom you see he killed his mom so he's also dead and feels nothing that's deep now i really expected just clever and moving magnolia like dialogue between a father and a son but this is garden state so this is pretty much it john garden state father i forgive you you didn't know what you were doing when you drugged me for a zillion years but i know you love me crappy director's dad no no i'm gonna say some simple stuff cause i'm not really so deep of a character anyway like this whole movie actually so no john garden state no dad we must get along cause we are equal individuals i mean different individuals crappy director's dad no no ok you convinced me br br and he gets the girl cause he's no longer dead you know and the movie ends and i go and eat a piece of chicken that makes my day br br this made for trailer movie sucks
<START> written by someone who has been there you can tell but only if you've been there excellent performances by meryl streep of course renee zellweger and william hurt br br many people have said that it is about a dysfunctional family i think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment to not be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional you are losing your family as you know it can anything be worse people need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change how they do it maybe they will see that the father is denying himself valuable time he'll never get a chance at again maybe they will realize how hard it is to die or to watch someone you love die they didn't miss much of the nightmare it's hard to forget
<START> br br her excellency madam shabana azmi has worked in countless movies over life time i think best is yet to come br br fire is ok br br but still good days are yet to come br br hopefully in water i will be able see her better br br thanks and regards br br ps india doesn't have a director to make best use of her
<START> this is more than just an adaptation of bond it's a plain rip off with mediocre character sketches that ian fleming would not have approved of this film goes down as the worst 007 movie an older even haggard connery tries to relive his past 12 years later the result is a humourless tacky version of the classic hero give me roger moore any day
<START> this movie may bear some historical importance and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together the setting the rocket the space suits the surface of the moon all scream a classic but in the end the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes and the 50ies tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments the characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis but bear too little entertainment value many times br br much of this movie seems like a good movie for nine year olds the mature themes the human drama and the violence are kept to a level for children as well br br the images of the earth and the moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than the ones in 2001 but so what if their use is dramatically inefficient especially 2001 may seem like a stretched out meditation over themes of this movie and has star wars not somehow modelled it's space scrolling opening titles on the opening titles of this film but then again the inheritance is marginal br br if its a real groundbreaking and mega influential mature sci fi classic you are looking for however check out forbidden planet
