<START> it is hard to imagine two actors of such class and experience as michael caine and michael getting involved in such an embarrassingly inept film the responsibility for this ill judged production has to be down to the writer neil jordan and director conor mcpherson i doubt i've seen such a bad film with such good credits in a long time the comedian dylan moran who made his mark as the irritable and incompetent bookshop owner in the tv sitcom turns in much the same routine here except with such excess and lack of comedic control as to leave one squirming it is easy to see how the story could have been made to work for the situation is an interesting one and loaded with comic potential a classical actor caine tries to rip off the mob and co with the aide of a bumbling wannabe colleague moran with predictable results it could have and should have been good sadly it was not to be
<START> i have seen several yul brynner films yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls smiles and laughs brynner might have been equally arresting in ten commandments the magnificent seven the brother karamazov and the mad woman of but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one he is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot br br equally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive she reprised this sort of role years later in the night of iguana the film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the russians in fact she is shown as running away from the russian major in contrast to the maupassant story or the story yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the kerr character br br kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress she puts her soul into the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character it is this contradiction that makes her roles in the journey quo vadis and the night of iguana memorable br br why is this an unusual film it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good people dr zhivago was an exception romance of a horse thief was again great cinema by abraham but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the post mccarthy era br br the film is also unusual in its casting great french actors gerard and anouk aimee rub shoulders with jason robards jr and british actor robert morley in many ways the film is international than american all four are great actors and add to the entertainment br br those who have read maupassant and works will find the film is not true to either work yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized censored version has a dignified charm of its own provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group i think litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales e g the last bus ride and the final kiss br br but i do have one why do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories only recently e g insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits
<START> firstly i'll admit i haven't seen vampires los muertos but i've seen the original vampires film and love it i rented this film having heard nothing about it i didn't expect to be impressed i wasn't br br i love the idea of shifting the action to the far east which should have opened up a lot of new avenues for the action sequences as well as the story line but not enough was made of this the fight scenes and the motorbike chases were painfully boring br br there were some parts i liked like the way the slayer team weren't shown as heroic good guys as they were in the first movie br br i'd been hoping since i saw the old hammer movie legend of the 7 golden vampires a few years ago that someone would one day make another good asian based vampire film this was not it
<START> the end of suburbia as it should appeal to general citizens mass consumers alike is likely to become of cultural reform status the film uses super cynical analysis by authors policy makers and social philosophers on the paradox created by suburban style living mainly in the post war era br br what we have created in america is a place with none of the amenities of country life and none of the amenities of urban city life this is the prescription that is laid out for suburbia and the film on the singular idea of oil basically in the most general sense that the world is nearing or at it's peak oil production and when we realize this in full major lifestyle changes will be in effect whether by our best interest or forced violently upon us by a quality of living even the slum dwellers of calcutta couldn't describe to us br br if nothing more the end of suburbia will siphon the viewer flush in their gut creating a sickening feeling this is bound to happen it's a bleak outlook on our inherent way of life the ambivalence lies particularly in each respective viewers critical analysis of the film i foresee many unprepared viewers slandering the film as smug liberal propaganda like a michale moore film what they fail to consider is that a reaction like this is all too normal when such a message hits so unbelievably hard to the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses br br this is the truth and as a student studying city planning i can tell you that we better get prepared now because what slim chance we have of maintaining quality of life in this dwindling cesspool of tampered resources is fading faster than a race of people stricken by the black plague
<START> 12 17 01 all i can do with this film is improvise on my impressions i wasn't given the changes don't know the score and am not schooled in the genre i always had problems following chord changes anyway trumpet player y'know so i was pretty well limited to doing the basic keep the tune in mind and ad lib around that what jammed me up about this incredibly moody black and white blues piece was the knot it gave me in my head and heart in trying to figure out whether to go with the ensemble or pick out a path along the tune story i guess i went with the tune as usual i kept getting lost on the changes too deep extensive over my head probably still it was a gas to try to keep pace i admired the actors' playing to the theme and story line i didn't see some things or things others seem to i didn't feel the light skin gal was trying to pass as much as she was either oblivious to the color issue or was trying to ignore it at first later she came back fighting the brooding light skin young man his trumpet noodling mas ludicrous was ambiguous ambivalent and perhaps his best feature remote what i thought after the shadow curtain closed on this provocative piece is the foundation of a thing like this is it a way of finding reality by setting up a stage peopling it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and theme is it any more real or truthful than a well crafted script without the benefit of editing and revising is improvisation heroic moreso than crafted work where is there greater or clearer truth in retrospective art craft or in fabrication and well i am still lost in this question i loved the film it got me lost in a cool blue foggy evening where i just had to go home and get out my horn guess what i broke out in a twelve bar blues riff tried and true couldn't make myself stray from the tune reality is just too scary jaime says give them a 7 and more i'm on break
<START> i didn't understand what that line meant i do now i didn't really want to see dirty dancing either i'd rented it out but never watched it and today i did and i thought it was a really fun great movie that makes you want to get up and dance alright it was cheesy at times but it's still a great movie i can't believe jennifer grey was 27 in this movie my friend and i thought she looked about 18 or 19 20 at the most i guess this is attributed to her acting talent and she did really look awkward at times patrick swayze is also very good but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old nevertheless still very good i love 80s songs so it really struck a chord with me and the love story yes i'm a romantic was so wonderfully done i thoroughly enjoyed this movie exceeded my expectations
<START> mexican werewolf in texas is set in the small border town of furlough where anna erika fay lives her best friend is rosie martine hughes she has a mexican boyfriend named miguel gabriel who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town killing livestock several residents including some of their friends local mexican legends speak of the an evil creature from myth legend erm i'm struggling now because not that much else actually happens br br written directed by scott i won't beat about the bush here simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful period the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once the rest of the time it's referred to a in fact i suspect this wasn't really conceived as a werewolf flick at all the 'werewolf' creature looks mostly hairless more like some vicious dog there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions there is no transformation scene at the end when it is killed it doesn't change back into anyone either to be honest apart from the title there's nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all even then the title is just a rip off of the highly popular an american werewolf in london 1981 this is the type of home made crap that i personally think is killing the horror genre how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead 1978 the evil dead 1981 halloween 1978 or friday the 13th 1980 which were all made on shoe string budgets maybe the blair witch project 1999 but that's it in recent years crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic the character's are awful things just happen around them the dialogue is rubbish the pacing is terrible the story sucks virtually sent me to sleep as a whole this film is just crap i'm sorry but i don't know how else to describe it br br director does nothing to make this watchable there's the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache quick you'll miss editing which just annoys irritates in equal measure it's not scary there's no nudity there's no tension or atmosphere the special effects are awful the monster really does look poor it's no wonder keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it there's virtually no colour to the picture either it's either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well the gore consists of some fake guts blink you'll miss them a few bloody wounds a severed arm big deal br br with a supposed budget of about 300 000 i admit the budget was low but i simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far the whole thing has the look of a home movie it has no style is throughly bland dull to look at the acting sucks too although you probably already knew that br br mexican werewolf in texas will probably con a few people into renting buying watching it because they might mistakenly think it's a sequel to john classic which it most certainly isn't it isn't even a proper werewolf flick either don't be fooled this is awful i'm fed up of having to waste time money on home made amateur crap like this
<START> an odd willfully skewed biopic of dyan thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry instead we have to endure a raw character seen through the prism of his proto relationship with wife sienna miller and childhood love keira knightley matthew rhys plays thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self interest and cillian murphy makes up the persistently tense br br the film never seems to decide on where it's going there's no arc so much as a from one end of the war to the other seems much more interested in his two female leads who wouldn't than in the man who brings them together and then divides them miller is the choice of the two i found knightley competent at best but then i have never found her sympathetic but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent welsh accents other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of william murphy arty production eg double that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn't blend 4 10
<START> not only did the effects and acting in this movie bite but the story was terrible br br a scientist discovers that a comet fragment will hit the moon world leaders ignore him he builds a shelter then everyone is upset that he is playing god br br how lame he built the thing why is everyone entitled to access totally lame story don't waste your time
<START> aristocats is such a terrific disney classic that i just loved so much as a kid still to this day i can't resist watching it it's just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs i really miss the animation films like aristocats they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family aristocats is also very witty and clever the story was just so wonderful this film is just beyond irresistible i think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the lol it was just so cute with the piano playing and painting br br and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children but when the lady feels it's time to make her will she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler the butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and them in the middle of no where and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of thomas they head back home to their lady but learn the coolness of being a cat br br the aristocats is just a perfect disney movie that i feel is a bit over looked i would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families it could be enjoyed by anyone the songs and story is just memorable i will always join in for the movies best song everybody wants to be a cat such a great tune i also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned they were just so cute this is a terrific film please watch it you won't be disappointed br br 9 10
<START> tromeo and juliet 1996 is another jewel in the troma studios film archives like the toxic avenger troma's war class of nuke 'em high terror firmer and sgt n y p d this film is an instant troma classic james gunn updates romeo and juliet taking a medieval tragedy and it as a modern day street punk drama if you have seen or read the play before nothing much has change except it has been br br lloyd kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the screenplay and makes it highly enjoyable film the actors handle the script very well i was surprised by how well they performed the dialog a lot better than some hollywood big budgeted actors utilizing a monstrous budget and expensive sets i enjoyed this movie very much lloyd kaufman doesn't disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other troma productions i would rather watch one of his films and be entertained than watch an boring expensive movie with pampered over paid actors lame scripts lazy directors and those awful c g i special effects br br i highly recommend this movie if you like fun films with cheesy special effects over the top acting and inspired directing then this movie's just for you
<START> not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted i will only say this br br nearly everybody says they loved curly best but i will put brideless groom up against any of other the stooges shorts br br i think it's the most hilarious from start to finish as well as being the most re watchable br br the off key singing student christine mcintire's cousin basil routine and of course emil j p are highlights but only around the stooges' impeccable timing and the great writing too br br nuff said
<START> salesman lenny brown woods is fast losing his knack of selling the proverbial ice cream to eskimos given a chance to shine in california by a philanthropic entrepreneur brown and his wife linda young live the high life off tax shelter investments a fortune they lose when the federal government changes the tax laws br br seven hundred thousand dollars in the red and in need of a the yuppies without portfolio begin to hoover vast quantities of colombian marching powder up their hooters until they find themselves with rather hungry monkeys on their back after briefly cleaning up linda's coke induced miscarriage sees lenny once more careering like a pinball between uppers and downers living purgatory follows br br a contemporary take on reefer madness with perverse echoes of albert brooks' lost in america the boost was overshadowed on release by tabloid revelations concerning an alleged affair between woods and young and their tumultuous falling out woods then engaged to horse trainer sarah owen now his ex wife reputedly slapped a 2 million lawsuit on his spurned co star for emotional harassment during filming citing fatal attraction style late night phone calls to his fiancÃ©e and in one noteworthy incident reputedly leaving a mutilated baby doll on his and owen's doorstep br br ironically the lack of chemistry between the supposedly loving leads is one of the more depressing aspects of this latter day exploitation flick the only real passion woods demonstrates towards young is when he's kicking her around the room the script too is hilariously dreadful perhaps mitigating young's near comatose performance when given howlers like stay with me 'til i fall off the earth to emote further given woods' edgy dramatic personae his jittery descent loses all credibility when actually he looked that way to begin with br br ultimately the boost must be seen in context in the 21st century cocaine use is ubiquitous however in 1988 with america still embroiled in an war on drugs the very fibre of the nation looked to be in peril hence one of the most hellish and for that read hysterical depictions of drug abuse
<START> i have to confess that i slept in the cinema while watching the first asterix movie but this one is simply fantastic it is really funny and it leaves the first one miles away it has gags and funny situations that made me laugh since the first minutes of the movie and i only stopped laughing when i reached the car to return home i repeat this movie is spectacular is really funny and cleopatra is a real babe
<START> hari om is an indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name played by the wedding planner from monsoon wedding greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern india there's no bend it like beckham backdrops and stereotypes and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of bollywood however the soundtrack is well worth procuring but rather the feel that you are seeing the real india permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors fortunately for us hari companion is a young and beautiful french woman in search of a journey with overtures of an y tu mama tambien trip toward self discovery without the sex and fatal disease this beautiful film calms and brings the philosophic mind against the initial juxtaposition of the protagonists all identify with traits of both and the cultural divide disappears as humanity steps in most succinctly put the movie's central theme everyone has a love story don't let yours pass by teaches us a great deal about love on a number of levels don't let this film pass you by
