<START> i got this as part of a competition prize i watched it not really expecting much from an obviously low budget production i laughed myself sick there are obvious references to other films in the horror genre texas chain saw massacre friday 13th etc all the standard clichÃ©s were there long drive through partially arid and somehow menacing countryside inbred red necks mysterious vehicles tracking you throw in some really good humorous scenes petrol from the camper van and dialogue f g virgin that's got to be an oxymoron and you have one of the best spoof horror films for years i particularly liked the way our reluctant hero used his stress related nose bleed to great advantage
<START> i just saw this movie on tnt and let me tell you this movie was downright corny and cheezy but after a certain point i began to laugh my socks off and to tell you the truth they should classify this movie as comedy rather than action adventure the absolutely most hilarious scene comes when the delon and kennedy are making loop the loop 360's to avoid the french missiles that wagner ordered to destroy the concorde our fearless leader kennedy decides to shoot flares out the window to stop the heat seeking missiles dumb yet funny the kicker comes here though after one shot the flare gun malfunctions and kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie the dumb parts of this movie include the total lack of plot yeah lets have some action for 25 minutes than land in paris and go one hour with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants now lets switch to the saboteur for ten minutes then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that is visually breaking apart and the passengers don t even see it its right in front of their eyes final rating for this move 1 10 out of 4 stars if it were action 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy
<START> let me start by saying that if you're expecting subtle humour you're in the wrong theatre it's low brow and heavy hitting but he's not out to tickle your funny bone he's got the sledgehammer out and he's drawn a bead on the side of your head but fear not as movies go this is a fairly gentle education oh also heavy on the swearing but once again mike judge not fred rogers br br was this movie called f no the gem the essence that is mike judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves beavis and butthead was most popular with teen aged boys the very people at which it incessantly poked fun br br with that in mind i don't think the humour in this movie is aimed at the super intelligent maybe you are all too smart to get it but he's not aiming at you he's aiming at your average joe and he's got a message get your act together and for god's sake study it is a little disjointed and the narrator gets to be a little irritating after a while but once again this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration it's funny it has a message that it wants to make sure that we all understand br br i question the casting of luke wilson in the role of a man with a 100 iq sometimes he's not able to play down what's he got like a 104 to the level of his character slightly forced at times br br kudos on dax shepard in this one i remember seeing him in and thinking this guys looks like an idiot in this movie he makes a great idiot maybe i'm psychic br br it took a while to warm up to maya rudolph but i gave her a little leeway after all she did have to play straight man to an entire planet but once she got a little screen time she made a solid contribution br br terry crews played the same psychotic aggressive character he's played many times before but he makes a first rate president none the less br br another bonus is that the place was practically empty counting my girlfriend and i there were literally six people in the theatre we could've had a barbecue pit and a mariachi band so no annoying people talking as appears to be the norm in the to the tv' age br br all in all a good premise and a competent delivery given the intended goal lots of laughs sprinkled throughout br br what made this movie scary was the fact that when we walked out of the theatre it was sort of like the movie was still playing we saw a lot of idiocy in the people immediately around us maybe made more apparent by the dose we got in the theatre br br they're all pods all of them
<START> the summary was promising but watching the movie was a huge disappointment nothing happens in this movie plot is linear and without surprise normal characters stay normal until end of the film weird characters stay weird until end of the film there is even not a single tentative to foul the viewer into thinking that the bad guy is someone else than the most obvious candidate on the positive side actors play quite well and there is a tiny bit of atmosphere in the movie but much too little to be any significant br br people who vote 10 for this movie either didn't see it or are member of the movie production team 4 is well paid
<START> i am a huge fan of big loud trashy completely stupid action movies such as the rock con air etc all of these are great fun to watch but when you think about it extremely silly in the line of fire tells a story and it tells it well with plausibility as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think the last shot of the movie is eastwood and russo sitting together on the steps of the white house watching the pigeons to gentle peaceful music and i felt a deep feeling of satisfaction this was because i cared about the characters and i was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion it felt like a true story as the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that he failed to protect jfk on that fateful day in dallas clint eastwood is fantastic he brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary on the other side of the spectrum is john malkovich as the creepy predator who tortures eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly telling him of his plan to kill the current president this oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin throughout the movie malkovich talks to eastwood as if they are friends he doesn't threaten him he doesn't lie to him he doesn't laugh at him but he tortures him with his unbearable friendliness right up to the last moment as well as this thrilling main plot there is a charming love story involving rene russo another agent and eastwood despite the age difference they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely to sum up i love this film because it has a mind
<START> as a child of the 80's like so many of the other reviewers here i hated the original v and v the final battle i own both on vhs and never hook up the vcr to watch them i do remember not liking this short lived series very much but i couldn't remember why so i rented the first disc by the third episode i had my memory refreshed it's terrible the writing is beyond horrid it's not even fun they had a lot of material to work with here but it seemed like they just didn't know what to do so they turned it into of our lives with lizard aliens' how cool and full of potential is the concept of elizabeth the all they could think of to do is grow her into a whiny boring teenager to compete with her mother romantically marc singer looked less embarrassed to be in beastmaster ii than he did when he was trapped in this drivel point is whether you're one of the younger folk who's just discovered v or one of us older sci fi fans looking to rediscover some old fun spare yourself and skip this
<START> alert this review contains major spoilers do not read on if you plan to see this film br br judging from the amount of votes this got my vote was the fifth one very few people know or care who mimi is well back in the late 1980s professional wrestling was pretty decent an all woman's federation called the ladies professional wrestling association opened it was a great league and mimi was one of the names on the roster i always thought she was one of the best people the had in terms of ring skill and acting ability unfortunately the closed down in the early 90s so it only seemed natural for someone with as much talent as mimi to start an acting career right but surely there was an alternative to stuff like this this movie is really bad as it was going along i kept comparing it to an underrated movie called survivor quest ' only this film lacks everything that made survivor enjoyable br br as i started the tape i went to fast forward through the preview to get to the meat of the tape at first i wasn't paying much attention but then i realized that the preview was for a movie starring mimi oh ' i thought here's another movie featuring mimi to look for ' but as the preview dragged on i became aware that is was a preview forÂ 'beyond fear ' you know you're in trouble when the only preview at the beginning features the movie you are about to watch the plot of this thing is pretty standard plays an ex kickboxer that is living with the guilt of injuring an opponent friend so she focuses herself on her second career which she shares with her friend sammy being a wilderness guide on this particular occasion she gets a troop of three couples two of the couples are just there to take up space you think that one couple a caucasian husband and a korean wife will be explored as an issue appears between them halfway through the film but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the woods which consistently scares the korean wife the joke is funny the first time you hear it but it certainly isn't by the ninth time they do it the third couple is just painful to watch it consists of mr and mrs page they trade insults back and forth and mr page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he's not busy playing cruel jokes on his portly just like your typical american couple before the hike mr page is spying on two stupid guys and their prostitute one of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out mr page taped it so begins the peril as the two guys track the group on their trip and we and and and wait for them to finally do something when they do it's a fiasco br br you can't blame the cast they try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with the main culprit is director robert f lyons who needs to go back to playing bit parts and stay out of the director's chair lyons starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy sudden matter that you start to think he was suffering from throughout the entire shoot there's even one incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene with the thugs is slipped between some nighttime scenes then there is the sound department the music and background noise completely overpower the dialogue so that you have to move your ear right next to your television's speaker don't bump your head on the screen it isn't worth it to hear the poorly written lines speaking of poor writing gets some of the credit there as co writer the few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned for shots of the thugs or bad practical jokes early on knocks out a thug with a switchblade knife so not once do you think they are in any danger from the two stupid thugs when the crooks finally get their rear ends kicked by in a well done and long fight our cast all have a huge laugh together despite the fact that one of them has been shot and is bleeding everywhere yes everyone is happy in the end everyone except the poor souls witnessing the film wishing for the good old glory days when mimi performed in the wrestling ring zantara's score 4 out of 10
<START> cary elwes have to say puts on a better performance then costner did in but anyhow br br have to say this film it just makes me laugh so much mainly because the actors seem really into what their doing and you just sit there and thinking 'what the hell are they on' but in a very very very very good way the random outbursts of songs were brilliant and well and the musical score used i really really liked great casting and as said before everyone seemed so into their roles br br 10 10 from me defiantly br br unlike some other robin hoods i can speak with an english
<START> this movie is one of my all time favorites i think that sean penn did a great job acting it is one of the few true stories that made it to film that i really like it is in my top 10 films of all time i watch it over and over and never get tired of it great movie
<START> i first saw 2 on bbc2 in the 90's when i was at art college living and moving among artists and musicians hoping for future success so 'the second home' of friendships made after leaving the familial home of striving for a professional excellence strongly resonated with my living reality i was captivated by the characters the storytelling the lyrical camera work and above all by the music in it i could divine the beginnings of german electronic music of 50's can faust of the 70's the sound experiments of john cage walter carlos and the british electronic psychedelia of the white noise the soundtrack composer nikos studied with carl of fame so i found its tastes contemporary to the electronic pop sound effects world br br i hadnt seen or 3 so i watched it as a whole in itself without a before or after as someone else has commented it is both epic and lyrical historical and artistic many favourite moments including the wonderful voice of gisela muller evelyn the bach of daniel smith juan the piano playing of henry arnold hermann and the cello playing of salome clarissa br br i could write more but it's already been said here why can't british or us tv produce such masterpieces the wire had the realism and politics and epic sweep of a city david lynch and dennis potter had imaginative tropes to their tv work too but this is art house and soap at its most cinematic and narrative sublime it's never included in critics' choices of best films but it should be still as poetic and powerful as when i first saw it over 17 years ago i watch the 3 boxed sets every autumn for their inspired and inspiring
<START> i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors 1 speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill who rarely took drugs via syringe 2 the asian nurse who survived massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie this would have been impossible in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims 3 the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them not true in reality speck was at first calm and gentle reassuring the women he wasn't going to hurt them this is how he was able to tie each of them up 4 the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be fbi profiler robert interviewed speck in the 80's and said that speck not only did'nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie if the story wasn't so tragic and horrifying the voice over would be laughable all in all doug cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold blooded even though i don't think the real speck was so forward in his violence no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known after all for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them beverly ann performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film she is a very good actress if you are at all squeamish do not see this film it's very graphic and disturbing
<START> leni riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda moore tries to call humor that this movie and moore's other prevarications actually attract admirers proves that alas it's possible to fool some of the people all of the time br br let's see if we can bait foreigners let's see if we can extol obsolete factories let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world let's see if we can pretend we're funny let's see if we can out isolationist charles lindbergh the only thing moore lacks in comparison to lindbergh is a medal from gÃ¶ring br br admittedly in this film moore had a bit of self deprecation to his schtick in this film moore mocks roger smith ceo of general motors as an aloof uncaring elitist moore could do that in 1989 but now that moore has surrendered himself to aloof uncaring elitism this characterization of roger smith has an ironic twinge who really wouldn't rather be roger's buddy than michael moore's
<START> i give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for damon wayans as the cosby show was for bill cosby it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and i felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character br br michael kyle an interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person he is phenomenal in movies but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though i loved it i felt that the laugh was more important than plausibility br br jay kyle i have loved her since house party and have enjoyed her in school daze and martin this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to co star in i also feel that jay and michael were more like equals in the show but jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it worked br br jr just plain stupid his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing which drives me nuts not to mention that most of the situations in episodes i've seen seems to center around him br br clair the attractive sister who dated a christian i found her boyfriend's character to be more interesting than she was she'd be better off sticking to movies the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but it's not stereotypical enough br br kady lovable and the youngest daughter i think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and franklin br br franklin i love this character and i think they derived it from smart guy t j which only lasted one season they did a great job of casting for this little genius the effort would have been made if jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides also br br all in all this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it's homage to the cosby show is well done i love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that i can't wait to see the series finale
<START> nice doco br br even though it didn't work out how you wanted with the original film you have a fantastic piece of work and great viewing br br it is self evident how much you put into it br br that goes for everyone else too it's great to see the warts and all account of the process without being 'too nice' br br loved it well worth a view br br que pena the writer of 'the original' film couldn't appreciate what you have achieved br br love the attitude too great piece looking forward to seeing the next work br br keep going bro
<START> obviously this one doesn't aim for the brain the so called humour is based on farting and every clichÃ© about any ethnic genre you can imagine gays included of course as long as they are not wasp and a latino this besides john leguizamo does have talent and charisma but in such a self indulgent movie it is a definite waste what the point in trying to out jim carrey jim carrey himself the pest of the title could then be this movie almost as funny as bergman's finest prepare to be annoyed not amused
