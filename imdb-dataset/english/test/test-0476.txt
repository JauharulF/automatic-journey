<START> trey parker and matt stone the creators of south park finally get out of their grueling schedule to talk to the cameras while sipping champagne in their hot tub at first when watching this i did not sense as much sarcasm as there was in this i knew they were joking when they would complain about different actors on the show and when trey said he wasn't going to give his mother any of his money but there is so much sarcasm throughout that this documentary is more of a mockumentary full of inside jokes br br this documentary shows everything about south park up until the second season anyways it shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording it has interviews many of which are fake interviews but some amongst all the fabrications give insight into the show clips from both of trey parker's spirit of christmas shorts are shown as are many good clips from the show if you were a south park fan then this should have quenched your thirst for show knowledge back in late 1998 when this was made now obviously the show has changed but this is still interesting br br what we have here is an amusing documentary where trey parker especially and matt stone come off as arrogant jerks and that's exactly what they wanted to come off as they may be this way in real life but here it was a joke a 51 minute long insightful joke br br my rating out of 51 mins not rated contains language and sexual content
<START> just before dawn really surprised me when i saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than i expected instead the director jeff conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie building the suspense constantly until i was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it the lack of action in many parts gave it a very deliverance mixed with the texas chainsaw massacre kinda ambiance and when the action really kicks in its truly shocking and dramatic without ever even really needing to be gory the characters are about par for this kind of movie though more sympathetic than some and the bad guy memorably freaky the photography and suspense are the real winners in this movie and they keep it from ever being dull as has been suggested i firmly recommend this one to serious horror fans don't expect gore do expect a creepy backwoods tale with several awesome moments and a great dreamlike ambiance
<START> don't waste your time or money on going to see or even renting it it is by far the worst move i have ever seen its two hours way too long of your life you're never getting back if you're looking to be scared go see something else we went with someone who still has nightmares about the gremlins and she wasn't scared in the least br br there are so many things that make this movie an incredibly poor attempt at making money now before i begin let me say that i loved the first grudge however the second one is something of a different story the plot is very in depth and intricate however in the end you are wondering what the heck was this or that all about the acting would be considered poor in a b list pornography film i could site several examples but i don't want to spoil it for those that are for punishment but i can sum up two horrible hours in two simple words it's spreading
<START> oh what a disappointment this movie is i can't believe it was directed by there's practically no plot and 90 of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the katyn massacre the most interesting part comes right at the end but by that time i simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns br br almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand held camera which is supposed to convey the feeling of personal immediacy but there's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie instead the constant jerking of the camera made me seasick to be fair there are some great shots too no pun intended but nothing that makes you go wow br br if you're not familiar with the katyn massacre the movie will leave you scratching your head if you are familiar you'll be scratching your head too although maybe for different reasons basically the movie states and over and over again that it was the soviets who murdered thousands of polish soldiers in 1940 this point is hammered repeatedly as though someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact however the movie never tries to explain as to why they were killed after all tens of thousands of polish soldiers in the other soviet pow camps were not harmed and were released in 1941 it is also never explained adequately how many people perished although the figure 20 000 is thrown in a couple of times br br the acting is adequate with only old woman and lt jerzy giving noticeable performances but they get to act for maybe 10 15 minutes in total certainly not enough to carry the whole movie many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their matinÃ©e looks rather than their acting abilities but i won't mention their names suffice to say that they are definitely not the oscar material so any claims that this movie was robbed of the academy award are simply laughable br br the tone of movie is wrong as well on one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama on the other it resorts to cheap anti soviet propaganda such as showing a russian soldier tear up the polish flag and using it to clean his boots then there are some puzzling scenes which have absolutely no bearing on the plot such as a couple climbing on a roof or the of the university br br there are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting such as adding a political angle to the story or showing the german discovery of the graves or even portraying anna's trip from the soviet occupied part to the german occupied all of these aspects could have been the major part of the movie but instead they're reduced to a couple of minutes in the end we get a collection of loosely fitting confusing boring scenes about the reaction of poles to one of their greatest tragedies of wwii not very compelling and not worthy of at all
<START> this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i've seen in full the first was rope which i really enjoyed with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free whereas rope took place all in one room i didn't enjoy this one as much as rope but that's not saying this is a bad film it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more br br it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones as a thriller i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension the sound design is almost non existent you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them but the important things are missing the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all missing intentional no doubt yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside br br the film doesn't feel like it should either they are almost globe trotting from place to place yet it feels more confined the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving br br the performances are there but nothing amazing everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work the one stand out is otto kruger who has that rich ego evil persona down pat br br in the end i wanted more from this one i understand it's one of hitchcock's least exciting films but i did have a good time watching it i can recommend it just not enthusiastically
<START> the opening night for the 'south asian international film in new york was an event a lot of us were waiting for br br i would finally get to watch Â i was tired of watching the promo on a loop and the lingering taste of the song angel by in the promo left me begging to hear the rest of it i was impressed by the and tremendously curious about how the rugged looking auto rickshaw driver would win the hearts of the stunning sophisticated looking french tourist i remember being rather intrigued by the theme when i'd read a line or two about it in the papers ages ago especially so since i'd personally been very fascinated a few years ago by how flamboyant the rickshaws in were the snow and the crowds outside the theater only set my anxiety rising br br once inside the theater i found that the organizers only presented disaster i was uncomfortable and embarrassed by how poorly the event was organized and found myself in a difficult spot trying to explain and offer excuses to my friends of mixed nationalities whom i'd invited on the vip guest list i was hoping to prove to them that indian cinema was not always about eventually and finally the movie began sending some fresh air our way or so i hari om Â started with chaos and noise honking traffic and a whole lot of chaos i found myself smiling as i felt a sense of home filling up inside me br br thus began the journey of hari an auto rickshaw driver in jaipur Â the director couldn't have made a better casting call with this character from monsoon wedding to hari om Â vijay despite his non hero looks carries this movie solely on his acting skills and his take on the character replete with all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in rajasthan he's a winner all the way but how and where he learnt to speak english even that fluently is the question however his character portrays beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity i love his innocent portrayal of a simple guy from a who has big aspirations of being famous some and yet knows when to cut away to reality br br camille on the other hand enters the movie wearing clothes that anyone wouldn't dare to wear in a place like that it's funny however that no one seems to really care too much about her dressed like that she looks very very dazzling though especially in the latter half of the movie when she changes to indian attire her relationship with her boyfriend however seems very vague it probably adds to the touch of reality of certain kinds of relationships br br the movie takes us through the most beautiful parts of rajasthan Â the surprising part is that none of the places have been portrayed anything other than what they really are you see the dirt you see the primitive you see rajasthan exactly the way it is yet Â there's only one adjective that it leaves you with Â 'beautiful' br br this is the first director who probably knows how to portray india exactly the way it is with the dirt and the noise and all the negatives that india is attached to Â yet making it look like one of the most beautiful places to be in br br kudos to him for that br br the only downside of the movie that i could possibly see is the i found it rather slow at certain parts Â but rest assured that you will never be bored br br background scores add a classy international yet very indian flavor to the movie the song angel which plays at a very crucial time in the movie blends beautifully with the visuals br br i've also heard that besides the main characters all the other actors are actually just normal people who'd never ever faced a camera before that's commendable considering most of our so called established actors Â still can't portray realistic characters on screen br br all in all watching this movie was a beautiful experience Â it is a pot of emotions it's got romance beautiful visuals and locations great music a great cast Â a package deal when i walked out of the theater i felt proud to be a few days later i asked one of my bulgarian friends who had watched the movie with me if he'd want to watch another indian movie Â and his response was Â is it better than hari om if it is then i'll if not i think i'll pass from now on hari om will be the benchmark for every indian movie that i see mr bala are you reading
<START> this film would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry especially in any indie capacity those whose inheritance includes a film introduction may not appreciate it quite as much i am hard to please in the documentary category this doc is different though its pleasure comes from an earthy realism of indie filmmaker punks who are a hoot to be around and watch whether you've ever wondered what it is like to be in films in front of or behind the camera or whether you have worked your way through the sometimes painful and hard but rewarding indie world you'll certainly get a kick out of this film
<START> since the past couple of days i'm really hooked on the female scorpion series and i keep hitting myself over the head because i waited until now Â which is way too long Â before purchasing the whole box set beast stable is the third brilliant effort in a row and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment never before or after has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines settings themes and filming styles the original more or less qualified as a so called women in prison flick but already an atypical one but you can't possibly categorize parts 2 and 3 as such since they hardly feature any footage within prison walls and the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well the first film was harsh and gritty whereas the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mainly melodramatic don't let this last description discourage you however as beast stable still features more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage in spite of the dramatic ambiance the opening sequence for example is downright fantastic still a fugitive from the law literally chops her way to freedom on the subway when there's no other possibility than to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman that handcuffed her her run through the city with the cut off arm dangling on hers while the credits appear on screen accompanied by the familiar theme song is just pure and genuine exploitation gold the story compellingly continues with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city but the poor thing simply can't escape her past or even new types of agony befriends a prostitute though without exchanging dialog and takes on a job in a sewing her own retarded brother impregnates the prostitute while gets in trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network she cleverly prevents a thug from taking advantage of her body encounters a former enemy from prison and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she gets submitted to a barbaric abortion meanwhile the one armed cop continues to obsessively prowl the streets looking for retribution against our multi talented director ito formidably criss crosses all these story lines to a powerful wholesome and never once loses grip on the visual aspects or ingenious filming style beast stable features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine the editing is flawless and the exterior locations are effectively depressing those who know character a bit are aware that the film seriously lacks memorable dialogs but this always gets widely compensated with wondrous on screen charisma and menacing grimaces there's very little sleaze apart from the aforementioned incestuous sub plot but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words in fact i think part three might just be the greatest or at least my favorite one of the series so far my only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is regarding the ridiculous sounds one of the birds produces when is locked up in a cage that bird sounds like a ventriloquist's dummy with stomach cramps

<START> i'm also a sf buff among other genres and i especially like those films from 60's and 70's with their ideas over effects premise that produced so many intelligent and likable stories put on screen in a nutshell i completely agree with scott review of this movie i heard of this film and being what i previously mentioned a 60's and 70's sf buff with a penchant for sf stories with touch of the twilight zone i expected a lot and my expectations were heightened with reviews ranking the effects of this movie second best to kubrick's 2001 space odyssey what a fraud journey to the far side of the sun was ordinary convoluted half baked silly looking film with laughable amateur special effects and remember i love films from that era and despise cgi and it can be fully compared more to 60's sf disasters such as marooned which journey very much reminded me of the idea behind it all is not that bad but building the plot on a story of a twin planet to earth on which the same world is inverted asked for a master like kubrick to direct needles to say robert parish is nothing like that so he delivered boring and silly movie that looked and felt like a matinÃ©e tv series of those days not worth wasting your time on even if you are an absolute fan of the genre
<START> unger was a card playing legend he was quoted in an interview as saying some day i suppose it's possible for someone to be a better no limit player than me i doubt it but it could happen but i swear to you i don't see how anyone could ever play gin better than me there's a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have plopped it in 'x men' as a showcase for a superhero's mutant power that's how incredible this man was br br i have a few minor problems with this movie as dark as this movie was real life was darker poker pro todd said during the last world series of poker bob mike sexton and i had a drink and talked about stu mike told us how he could barely talk hadn't showered in weeks and how his fingers were burned black by a crack pipe in the film michael imperioli looked far too healthy to be stu unger in the final years of his life when won his last he looked like a skeleton but let's face it this production lacked both the time and the deniro to make that kind of transformation my other problem was that i wish there was more poker playing with actual hands and situations sure it might have bored the average non poker enthusiast but it would have been nice for the too bad the movie wasn't 6 hours or so longer br br i watched the movie with 3 non poker players and they all thoroughly enjoyed it just like you don't have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy gibson's the patriot you don't have to be a poker player to see this gem can't wait for the dvd 8 out of 10
<START> alright how someone can actually think this movie is awesome is so beyond me i can't even comprehend how someone can find this movie remotely funny the only character it has going for it is the evil super nerd game designer and that gets old after a while this movie is so predictable the punchlines are not funny they're forced you see better acting at the red light district and the story sucks it's so predictable you know exactly what's going to happen even the characters do not react like they should try going to the hot chick that is your boss at work and telling her that you're banging 2 crazy chicks that you live with at the same time her response wouldn't be smile ok let's get back to work i didn't laugh once during this movie and i wish i had never seen it or spent 3 to rent it because that's not even worth it adam sandler produced this movie i have lost all respect for him all his movies are the same his comedy style got old ever since the waterboy came out if i knew adam sandler had produced this before i rented it there's no way i would have wasted my time on it this movie is as bad as it can possibly get from every aspect ace ventura wasn't a smart comedy movie it didn't have a killer plot but it was original and it was hilarious i'm not knocking the movie because it has 'low level' humor i'm knocking it because it sucks it's a piece of hollywood crap if this movie was presented to a production company and din't have adam sandler behind it it would be thrown in the garbage quicker than a used condom if you want a good movie about pot culture watch cheech and chong or if you rent this movie all you will get is a generic comedy that targets 14 17 year olds with loud rock music at every possible cut acting that will make your eyes squint and your stomach turn and comedy that is equivalent to watching your stoned friend eating mcdonalds for an hour and a half don't do it for the love of god this movie sucks treat it for what it is and look past all the hollywood glory behind it hercules in new york used to be the worst movie i had ever seen but it's actually so bad it's good this instead was a very expensive movie that sucked just as much if not more
<START> critics are falling over themselves within the sphere of influence to praise this ugly misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it's based ham fisted direction of the gory and shrill overly episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this civil war love story are they kidding after ms kidman and mr law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small north carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near death experiences to reunite with his soulmate who cares philip s hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to renee appearance as a corn fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of kidman's lonely farm to save the day rarely has a performance screamed of look at me i'm acting smugness her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin released by miramax strategically for oscar and golden globe what a farce consideration the weinsteins apparently own along with dick clark the critical community and won 8 globe nominations for their overblown failure the resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small less powerful pr driven films become obscure cold mountain is a concept film and an empty bitter waste of time cold indeed
<START> was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories his blind dead series started off great but had some truly laughable moments such as shots of a small model boat in a water tank for the ghost galleon in the sea serpent he hits rock bottom and takes some notable actors along with him telling the tale of a silly sock monster that brings google eyed terror to a few water tanks and miniature aquariums br br a vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an aborted military mission where american pilots for some unknown reason drop an atomic bomb brazenly cartooned into the frame of the film somewhere in the ocean off the coast of spain the military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent american flag and a portrait of a deranged looking ronald reagan one of only a few things that makes this movie really seem like the eighties the other two are the hilariously inept subtitle that declares the year to be 1 and power's dated sheena easton hairdo which would have looked really cool next to some ripped neon sweats br br one of the monsters you will ever see rises from the depths disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb we learn that the errant atom bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish unfortunately for our cast it has no effect on the sea serpent which swiftly descends on the coast of spain for some miniature set mayhem br br now when i say the monster is unrealistic i am not exaggerating it's not just sort of fake looking i'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that they seem to have been allotted but most of the time it looks like it was made out of crayola markers a ping pong ball and an old sock not only that it has this ominous music that accompanies it wherever it goes music that sounds so much like the jaws theme that it's a wonder nobody got sued br br along with power timothy bottoms and ray milland are caught slumming and the dialogue could not have been any more dismal through a series of plot contrivances our leading actors are thrown together in a quest to well i'm not sure what the purpose is bottoms and power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts he is blamed for a serpent induced shipwreck she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting none of this matters because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved nobody admits the serpent is real and it's not even dead furthermore power and bottoms are still on the lam from the law br br as illogical as it seems nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists despite numerous disappearances a trashed lighthouse and a crushed railroad bridge and they embark on an extended non adventure to track down and chase the monster away not kill it since they know they are no match for it their big plan is to use flares to scare it off although their scheme is botched the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support don't ask and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away the critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasn't frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock but never mind it swims away and our heroes are sure it's gone forever the end br br i can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on a script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a spliced in sock puppet stop motion beastie at least the supporting characters got to have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant serpent head i'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie the monster is cheap but there are some rather elaborate miniature sets so somebody did spend some time making those not to mention the stop motion animation involved it's seemingly played straight although maybe this film's sense of humor went over my head in the end the film is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken commentary watch it at a party for best results
