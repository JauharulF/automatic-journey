<START> after a somewhat slow start i thought this movie about the italian occupation of a greek island during world war ii picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours from primarily two points of view br br the love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable because i know it happened in various places under occupation penelope cruz played a young greek girl engaged to be married to christian bale i had questions about the depth of their love from the start but their future was torn apart when italy invaded greece and went off to fight after german intervention greece is conquered and the island lives on comes under italian occupation during which meets and begins to fall in love with captain nicholas cage this of course was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands as they got to know their occupiers they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people and sometimes fell in love often to the disapproval of their neighbours i just finished reading an interesting book about the german occupation of britain's channel islands in which this was a major issue once returns to the island is torn between them br br the second background issue is the italian occupation itself which i thought was quite realistically portrayed first was the contempt with which the island treated their italian occupiers greece defeated italy quite true from a historical perspective and was really conquered by the germans the refusal of the town to surrender to the italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a german officer struck me as something that could well have happened and was quite funny in fact i loved the line we would rather surrender to this dog than to you italians the portrayal of the italian troops also struck me as believable the italian army was never enamoured of their german ally and never enthusiastic about fighting with them although hitler and mussolini were close friends their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt here the italians are more interested in singing than fighting which the german troops on the island simply can't understand and are ecstatic when italy makes peace and withdraws from the war until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the germans it was all quite well done i thought br br it falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish but still deserves praise br br 7 10
<START> a wallflower is tossed into the sea and dreams herself into a pirate fantasy as a damsel in love with a pirate's apprentice energetic and good natured perhaps but a shoddy enterprise a failed musical send up of the pirates of with a cheap backlot feel wan bubblegum songs and constant leering overacting kristy film career took a real hit after this while leading man christopher atkins cannot get a grip of any particular emotion his voice wobbling about in search of an appropriate tone you have to wonder if that's the best title they could come up with what's the level of wit going to be in the actual script the movie's grease like affection for musicals doesn't gel with its penchant for slapstick a la airplane although works overtime being effervescent and nearly makes the limp handling look endearing for the most part it is an embarrassment 1 2 from
<START> emanuele did a fantastic job with one of those films that linger in the back of your mind for years it was see comments and synopsis here in imdb br br now carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on screen then he takes the audience into a dark void a literal plunge into dangerous waters the subject is migration in this case from italy to the new world the name of the film a big deal calling it for its american release the golden door br br the story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest that is their lives for a dream br br i hate to spoil the show telling the story so i'll dwell a bit in the work and all his team did so brilliantly br br first of all choosing to stick to what he knows direct sound as much as possible this means the whole film the textures the pain the nuances of reality are always mingled with the smells the heat or the cold the sweat and the blood life and death as as it is in real life br br the squeaks of bent metal and grinding wood the infamous drone of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship horns are among the points that make this film so involving br br cinematography is in the hands of a french the symbolism of light is present from the very first shot again almost the very first shot from and pervades throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation the subdued tones and the very gray and grim depictions of people suffering the cramped and filthy boat they sail to hope is mesmerising br br light is used sparsely almost to discover every character in the dark the beauty of every shot and every scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors br br again as he usually does vincenzo amato is definitely on his own he plays the father of two sons the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters br br charlotte gainsbourg is so so i guess she's never achieved again the perfection she reached in the cement garden and in her very first film br br maybe it's just that she seems a bit awkward in her role br br the locations and sets are harsh and compelling almost playing a character on their own br br maybe the most remarkable character is the one played by the mute younger son the contrast here with his first role is complete then he played a supercharged kid that was as relentless as anything around him now his character is all expression and just that no words at all his eyes tell the whole story with sublime power br br maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the states it's absolutely italian in everything it's so italian that most of the time the language is one of the many dialects that is much older than italian itself in the usa this film may be a bit too much for americans because of the subject but anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the states will see this films with awe br br and again the minimalism that goes hand in hand with ideas is back with a closing scene in the water only this time it goes from underwater photography to aerial br br all in all another great and very well told story from this filmmaker that only this year 2006 has collected 6 prizes and was nominated for the golden lion not a small deed
<START> this movie was nothing like the book i think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to gone with the wind and been turned down this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book for a gone with the wind fan of both the book and the movie this was deeply disappointing if you loved the book scarlett don't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen they only share the title in common
<START> this film fails on every count for a start it is pretentious striving to be significant and failing miserably the script was banal in the extreme nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting it was impossible to care about any of the characters knightly was a self regarding waste of time whilst sienna miller was just a waste of time the bit about the soldier who went off to war was a clichÃ© even before the film atonement used it the use of the second world war as a backdrop was in itself a clichÃ© the bombs the in tube stations etc employed to import a bit of much needed drama why anybody thought for a moment that this film was worth making is quite beyond my comprehension it was yet another case of let's get the costumes looking authentic never mind about the story the script or the acting
<START> la an audacious film by argentine director esteban succeeds both as a reinvention of the silent movie genre and a gripping cautionary tale the setting is a city in thrall to mindless television its people deprived of the power of speech except for a solitary and mysterious screen presence known simply as the voice in a bid to cement their grip on power the marvellously villainous duo of television mogul mr tv and mad scientist dr y set out to kidnap the voice and turn her unique talent towards their own dastardly ends it is up to a young family and the voice's nameless eyeless son to stop this evil scheme the result is a roller coaster of a story that is bewildering on occasion but never less than engrossing br br this is a silent movie that wears many of its influences on its sleeve the overt references to silent movie greats such as george melies and fritz lang will be readily apparent to anyone with a passing familiarity of their work but more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such tributes i particularly like the fact that mr tv and his henchman drive around in typical 1930s gangster cars drawn from the decade when the silent movie era died away and a very different industry began to emerge br br la mines the clichÃ©d plot devices and theatrical over acting common to so many silent films albeit in a very knowing and humorous way it is the astonishing visual style of la that really sets it apart from the movies that it pays homage to from the hypnotic tv logo to the menacing hilltop transmission station this film abounds with dazzling visual inventiveness that is the rival of a studio ghibli animation Â and all this using real actors and handmade sets br br moreover though the style is often intentionally corny and theatrical this is still an unsettling provocative and emotional picture the use of religious symbolism throughout la lends added resonance to the struggle between the tv empire and the waning power of words at the same time many of the most powerful images are original ones including the hypnotic swirl of the television sets and the nightmarish tv food factory br br i hate to end this review on a sour note but i feel that the english language release of la is let down by the subtitles the original spanish subtitles are used to great effect with much playing around with words on screen however the english language subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete with omissions and mistakes at times leaving the viewer to piece things together for themselves la is nevertheless a striking piece of cinema a visually breathtaking experience that displays great energy and humour whilst narrating a powerful cautionary tale
<START> for a horror film this is criminally dull a few memorable gruesome bits can't compensate for a really poor script very little coherence is achieved and the movie relentlessly overplays its one basic idea a killer cat until it becomes repetitive and things are made even worse by the constant use of shots from the cat's point of view 1 2
<START> camp blood br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 nu view 3 d br br sound format mono br br whilst hiking in woodland near the deserted camp blackwood site of an unsolved murder ten years earlier four young city dwellers are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills their guide courtney harris and stalks them through the woods with murderous intent br br low rent time waster filmed on camcorder utilizing the nu view field sequential 3 d format there's a plot at least but the script adheres closely to an established blueprint with obvious nods to the likes of friday the 13th the burning and the texas chain saw massacre without adding anything even remotely new or interesting to the formula director brad sykes also responsible for similar 3 d efforts like the zombie chronicles 2001 and bloody tease 2002 cites the early works of george a romero and sam raimi as key influences on his career but while those filmmakers challenged the mainstream with their no budget efforts sykes uses video technology merely to imitate his cinematic heroes resulting in a home movie with delusions of grandeur aside from the 3 d format there is nothing here to warrant anyone's attention followed by camp blood 2 2000
<START> a single mom her son and daughter and their hippie chick friend are camping in the woods a muscle bound machete wielding maniac in a yellow ski mask appears he starts terrorizing and sexually violating the family before murdering them with a machete wet wilderness is loaded with ugly hardcore sex forced incest and blatant racism it's as politically incorrect as xxx get the score is stolen from seminal hitchcock's horror classic psycho and also jaws the acting is hilariously awful the editing is bad and there are some huge lapses in logic the repetitive nature of the sex scenes grinds the movie after while so the brief running time is a blessing the scenes of violence are quite nasty for example the hippie girl is stabbed with the machete in her groin and one can see blood on her crotch 3 out of 10 and that's being generous
<START> the actors actresses on this series are ok but the scripts have been absolutely horrible this family is so dysfunctional that they are not even funny in fact the scripts illustrate very often how not to be a parent the scripts are so bad they make homer simpson look like a better father than this one br br anyone who is becoming a parent if you want to see what not to do with your kids this show is the perfect guide i think the garbage this show feeds us is beyond words br br michael rapaport has seen much better material in his career including his role in hitch they need a strong lead in better much better scripts than what i have seen to this point br br if you think this is generational my teenager even turned off one show of this because they thought it was horrible
<START> this movie is really bad most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement there's a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg there are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth and the plot is a bunch of post apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all the whole thing is just laughable
<START> the horror of this made for tv film was that it didn't end with this one it spawned a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot movie most films about various professions have some type of realism to them and of course are jazzed up to make it exciting this had none of that if the intent was to make in camp then it succeeded it resurfaced on cable a couple of years ago and failed again richard performance as the master chief who does it all was the only redeeming part of this film campier than the batman series of the 60's
<START> let's not beat about the bush here taylor undoubtedly slick movie has little to make it stand out from the biopic genre other than jamie foxx's exceptional career making performance remember the year they handed the special effects oscar to the terminator 2 uncontested they should do the same with this year's best actor gong br br that ray charles' story is worthy of filming is not in dispute indeed the many flashbacks to his traumatic childhood are well handled and used but for a life so unique the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar it follows the of a flawed genius' template almost to the letter hardship and exploitation women and drugs recording wrangles band squabbles rehab yeah yeah yeah and surely there was more humour in his life than we're treated to here br br i appreciate charles' music yet where neatly cut would have kept the story rolling indulges himself with near full length renditions of too many songs in gin joints in the recording studio in concert halls infinitum narratively and for non devotees they begin to act like a cinematic brake this may seem like harsh judgement on a music biopic but with a catalogue as extensive as ray's we need a taste not the whole dish otherwise we'd buy the albums br br intrigued as i was i glanced at my watch more than once so for all foxx's brilliance maybe ray would have been better served as an hbo two parter
<START> i didn't know anything about this dvd when i hired it had a quick look here at the comments but decided to keep an open mind obviously an independent film and low budget but that didn't worry me i will watch anything with jacobi and as always he played his part well what a pity no one else did i had watched a few weeks ago with vanessa redgrave and she was sublime in this she seemed to just turn up to read the lines in my opinion the main mistake was in casting vinnie jones to be honest i saw his picture on the dvd cover but didn't notice that he got top billing a sticker was strategically placed over his name it was watchable and i quite liked the dickens story alongside present day maybe with a more capable actor playing the lead this might have worked better still it was weak
<START> ah yet another seagal movie in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves as bad as submerged no but that is not saying much like perfume on a pig br br seagal is professional thief who wants to quit but goes for one last job only to be double crossed by his boss he lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback br br its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent cop or what he usually plays we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems then an eastern european territory as usual there is no wire fu either here don does an okay job br br however most of the action and fight scenes with stevie are clearly doubles scenes from other movies a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation seagal and make a so so team inspiring unintentional laughs one minute sighs the rest br br several notable faces turn up to slum it sleepy kevin tighe is a long way from his emergency days nick mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check no more rappers please br br at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up he should have gotten out a while ago
