<START> when the italians and miles o'keeffe work together nothing can go wrong as ever miles is great as the almost as great ator the most lovable barbarian of all times totally lives up to the first movie
<START> i thought this was a very good movie someone said it was 'sick' so they couldn't watch it i think if you realize its rated r then you will be prepared for the nudity and drug use it is a good story and the acting is amazing just can't be a prude to appreciate it its basically about a mom who does drugs and wants to get clean so she calls a very wealthy old friend and he moves them to his estate and crazy things happen i guess it is a drama i am just so sick of people who don't like movies because of cursing or nudity that is the world we live in you obviously aren't comfortable with yourself if you can't see things like this movie and it's rated r so that should tell you from the beginning that its not all peachy happy rainbows i liked it i think you will too
<START> some spoilers a soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it when charlotte and veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful low key truly erotic scene i also loved the music score and the soft muted cinematography i'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying my biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a and her life of course she has to be shown as a what else scatterbrained impractical absurdly frilly girly completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world moreover she's always shown with two days growth of beard for some bizarre reason as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is and she's waiting to get gender surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning in truth the character resembles a drag queen not someone in the midst of transitioning br br these are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to the film's of surgery is a way of people who are going through transition not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least at the very least why not have the character played by someone who really is i thought the male actor portraying veronica was okay but no better than that much better was the woman portraying charlotte a very complex character full of energy self loathing desire and contradictions if she was so fascinated by someone with female energy a charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it yes she was drawn to veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male female characteristics a gentle touch but with a good punch not as a unique person yes what a soap says about love is often lovely and moving but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process br br this film also proves that danes are lousy dancers for such a promising premise better executed in a film like different for girls the final film is a letdown
<START> the cast is admirably chosen and well balanced this cinematography is excellent the music is delightful as all of burt music is and is appropriate to the plot line making a musical version of hilton's tale is a welcome change from a plodding re make we see seasoned actors who add real depth to the emotional content and significance of each scene i cannot agree with the critics who overlooked this scintillating gem of a film it is a treasure of the silver screen find it if you can and let its magic carry you beyond the drudgery of daily worries inspiring you to find your own lost horizon
<START> i find it almost touching how star trek fans try desperately to like this film in spite of its unbelievable number of flaws br br to begin with none of the familiar characters are really in character so to speak scotty is depicted as a bumbling instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series uhura gods i can't even think about what they did to her character all of her dialog was painful to listen to mccoy seemed like a neurotic stepfather to kirk instead of his trusted friend spock well let's just say that leonard nimoy was terribly wasted he was given bad dialog i do not believe you have grasped the gravity of your situation captain gravity get it get it and made almost into a buffoon kirk oh man don't get me started william shatner is a hammy actor to begin with so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we got br br the plot is beyond ridiculous giving spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap but hey let's go with it the search for god again a weak plot basis you don't think so ok let's go with that too so assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound what's wrong with the script well for one thing it recycles way too much the enterprise for example is yet again not working properly are we to assume that starfleet would send a grossly ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want james kirk to handle the situation if that's the case then why not put him on a better ship as an adviser adding to that the crew is grossly incompetent scotty has the ship in pieces and apparently is enough to bump his head knocking himself into unconsciousness while there are hostiles on board no one seem to notice the klingon ship at a crucial moment despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in weapons range and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other in other words there is no sense of discipline if this is the flagship of starfleet then it's a wonder that the klingons hadn't already overthrown the federation br br as to the personal struggles with pain it was crap lawrence is a competent actor but even he couldn't save this turkey in short no one could of all the people involved i imagine leonard nimoy is the most embarrassed by it i hope he is anyway br br thank god the original cast didn't bow out on this opus
<START> this may be the most tension filled movie i have ever seen br br in fact it's so nerve wracking i haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago but i will since i have the dvd there were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch so if you've got problems and need to escape for an hour and half this film will get your mind off anything else br br the russian actress marina did a super job in facial expressions alone which she had to do since her character in here is a mute she plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker after the day's shooting is done and billie is about to leave she hears something she takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a snuff film and actually killing someone eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse type building br br there are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out the first i described above the second scene the climactic one goes on too long and isn't as well done as the first in fact the film should have been trimmed a bit but overall since it's so good at keeping our attention then it served its purpose as entertainment
<START> i finally managed to see this movie after so many years of expectancy br br i was so curious to see if this movie it is as bad as some people say br br and my opinion is that this movie it wasn't bad at all on the contrary it was amazing br br i enjoyed every second from it from the beginning until the end br br the actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the movie was playing br br the landscapes were so beautiful were the film was shot and it did charmed me also the music was extraordinary and i have nothing br br to reproach br br i think that the plot was very original i don't think that i saw a movie like this br br it is a shame that it isn't recognized all over the world to bad for those who didn't get the chance to see it i give this movie 10 10
<START> begrudgingly gave it a 3 one point each for fonda stanwyck and the supporting cast br br never saw this one before am watching it right now and it has just gotten to the part where henry fonda is carrying babs over the threshold if i continue watching it will be just to see if fonda and stanwyck will be able to pull this one out of the dumper br br but after reading the other viewer comments i'm not very optimistic br br the opening ski scenes were enough to put me off my lunch the voice overs were obviously done in a sound studio and the editing between the exterior shots and the closeups was horrendous i do not know that much about the technology of that era but i can't believe there wasn't something they could do to make it more believable br br my second gasp of disbelief was when fonda wiped out and i imagine due to the extreme velocity of travel he is burrowed head first into the snow up to his torso stanwyck pulls him out with obvious staged difficulty and i imagine because she is such an experienced doctor does not react at all to his apparently unconscious state and limp posture br br look i'm completely capable of suspending my disbelief but i couldn't get over the fact that she had just jostled a man with a possible head injury and that he might be paralyzed for life not my idea of big yuks br br so as i finish this comment we have just seen kirk's first jealous outburst and dr hunt is off to perform an i'm not sure which i hate more the script the background music or the story i'm done game over click
<START> unbelievable great cast fair acting interesting plot br br but this movie has such graphic cruelties that are not tense or giving thrills just pure disturbing br br spoiler br br everyone could see coming the freak returns to his habits and that robert englund was acting was he like an idiot forbidding your daughter to sleep with a football player but him trying to kill an idiot and liking is alright br br the policeman who's daughter was kidnapped anyone felt he was a cop and not an actor not me this movie drags on and on with an ending that we see in other horror movies if the returns were alright a part 2 could be made bad really bad stuff might give creeps some inspiration
<START> i love documentaries the andy goldsworthy doc was great i looked forward to this one but was very disappointed i knew of kahn and was intrigued by the idea of his lonely death in a penn station men's room there must be a story here i mistakenly believed the only story here is of sadly deluded women who had affairs with an ugly little famous married man in the absence of anything like an explanation for this guy's horrible behavior we're given endlessly repeated clips of kahn walking around and painfully long supposedly contemplative shots of his soulless buildings actually some of the buildings are interesting but the thrust of the film asks us to think about the guy himself the overwrought soundtrack references an emotional tug that is entirely absent from the film kahn's apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or martyr his mistresses this film seems to want to give kahn the great free pass and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic figures i don't buy it
<START> the second episode of the new lost gives you just what its fans were lacking a fair amount of riveting action from the very first scene you keep seeing brand new features you weren't expecting to encounter it's the best proof that the series its 4th season is still alive and kicking hard br br although the producers don't amaze us with some more flash forwards this time the return to flashbacks is more than satisfying as it brings some shocking facts the flashbacks introduce a few fresh characters and the familiar ones turn out to be connected in a surprising way br br the fresh characters dominate the whole episode and i can't say it does any harm their scenario parts and their actors both do extremely well providing us with a bracing feel right after the episode you'll realize that the show really needed people just like that and here they are br br confirmed dead is full of gripping action and greatly written dialogues i'm sure i'll quote the best scenes of the episode for the long time they're just that good that they remain on the mind the episode is entertaining smart and perky you like lost you have to watch it my vote is ten
<START> if you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival do not be misled by what it says in the booklet this is a complete waste of time and energy i have watched bunuel i have seen dali and admired them but this isn't surrealism this is not supposed to be at all didn't they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture after we become extinct by global warming these will be the of our civilization what if the aliens sample this as an example of our intellectual capital with all due respect to the effort put in this maybe it would be a good idea to terminate all the copies of this film or whatever it is
<START> good drama movie about a child custody case with great performances by all the actors a good example of what an excellent script can do to propel a simple story to a much higher quality the screenplay was just average though and this is what kept the movie from the list of the all time best dramas still the great acting makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court dramas or a big fan of the lead actors the movie really should have been a tad longer though for more excellence but that would really be nitpicking
<START> during the roberts preface i was beginning to think this was an ed wood production however what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff the story of crime and corruption in a southern town is told using a cast culled from hollywood's poverty row and this makes the movie all the more realistic there are no punches pulled here and at times the film is reminiscent of the well 1951 the black and white texture gives a newsreel like quality for certain younger viewers will be reminded of the blair witch project but this one is based on real events
<START> well i wouldn't want to lecture anybody but i do feel the urge to say some things i consider important about this beautiful film i saw it for the first time in 1976 i was 14 and then one more time a year later that was it the rest of it was the pink lp of elton john's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart how deep a week ago my cousin gave me a vhs copy as a present no dvd's yet boy was i surprised poets have always sustained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty love god idealist pursuits stay with you forever since they occur mostly at the heart's level no intellect yet they define your contours like a sculptor would do with a stone if sometimes we didn't tend to forget how right they are perhaps we would do better in understanding the meaning of every minute of every decision of every turning point of our lives br br so i confess i feel nostalgia but the fascinating part of this is watching the film again and through this trip back in time enriching that understanding of why we people from the 60's grew up as we did the spirit of those times is all here a genesis created far from the official world of consuming and economic success make love not war the beautiful pop ballads the poetry of the lyrics a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love these two lonely spirits still full of childhood innocence growing together as they learn mutual commitment and turning into adults br br i showed the film to a group of school youngsters and they abounded with such simplistic and cynical comments regarding it as naÃ¯ve and foolish guys be serious cinema is an art and as art it reflects not only human emotions but historical moments and this is exactly what friends does in a masterly way it reflects an idyllic idea of rebellion and new beginning we all dreamt about when we were 15 i'm now a musician and i feel some of us artists for that matter still dream about it how else could we live that's friends that's brother sun sister moon that's hair those were the times still alien to aids alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs with no melody to pornography presented as sexuality to this barbaric new world order growing after september 11th br br what a heart warming experience to see paul and michelle again timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world what a trip back to the very core of our hearts to paris to elton john at his best to that urban scenario surrounded by 2 cv and the vw beetles what a fresh air from the peaceful cottage in surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses they made us who we are as did serrat in spain in france peter paul and mary joan baez luther king the beatles the early bee gees belafonte's gandhi the gospel of elvis br br people still hoping get this picture start with innocence and grow from there you'll find out what it's all about and from there you'll have a solid and more truthful foundation some ideals to look for in life a way to handle personal and world affairs we need so much of this today give yourselves the chance and maybe someday the time of cynics will end i have an extra vhs copy br br santiago colombia
