<START> i use princess raccoon to give the film its not quite accurate english title as a litmus test for my friends' sense of humour it either leaves them cold and baffled as it clearly did several other commentators on this site or results in doubled up laughter huge grins and occasional gasps of admiration br br the laughter comes from the film's consummate mixture of parodies in contemporary style targets include a bouquet of japanese and western classical stage drama forms from kabuki to late shakespearian and spanish renaissance christian fantasy the naff vacuity of the modern american and european musical as witness a host of random tap and rap dance songs and some very funny banal lyrics all choreographed with loving amateur clichÃ© japanese anime and samurai live action clichÃ©s portentous buddhist ritual and the overweening sweetness of viennese operetta i've not laughed out loud so much at this type of film since ken russell's outrageous musical deconstruction in the boyfriend br br the grins come from the clever textual subversion of the japanese legend told in a traditional 5 act structure reminiscent of the plays of the 17th century master as in his work the narrative is advanced in a mixture of song high flown poetry and low comedy relief here the pot broiling of the incompetent ninja ostrich by peasants under the illusion that he is a raccoon in human guise all of this somehow does hang together and even more remarkably does manage to engage the watcher's emotions through the of cultural references br br in truth princess raccoon wears its pan cultural garb with alluring lightness and that's where the gasps of astonishment come in visually again as with russell's masterpiece the film is a treat a riot of colour with its digitised backdrops of classical japanese images from screens and prints over the top costumes and stage sets mixed with some breathtaking live action sequences in summer fields and you'll love it or loathe it but there's no point chalk for being cheese and princess raccoon stands first and foremost as a wickedly funny as well as affectionate put down of our contemporary cultural vacuity in both east and west bravo
<START> as far as i am concerned this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs i am used to viewing 1 the setting is paris france 2 there is 28 minute scene with no dialog br br both make this movie a bit unique at least to english speaking film noir fans actually an american jules shot the film so it's not entirely a european film initially i was disappointed in this after i had watched the first 40 minutes it's an expensive dvd and i was bored however once that silent segment started the actual heist you already know what's it about the film picked up considerably and just got better and better br br in fact i thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist the best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography this is what makes the disc worth owning it's excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen paris and this is paris in the mid 1950s there are lots of bleak but interesting rain soaked paris streets and buildings i found fascinating to view in fact there were many more of those great shots than of london in the much better known film the third man br br the lead actor in here jean i think his name is also is interesting to view someone described his face as a cross between humphrey bogart and harry dean stanton and that sums it up perfectly a warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film this is france not the united states so there is a little bit of both in here i appreciate the dvd offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version too
<START> a bit the movie in the movie case or as the theme is virtual game here which is the reality or even more frightening which reality is the real one as any cronenberg there are organic things like the pod and that wonderful idea the organic gun a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots teeth if there are some slower moments the sets designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution can be not liked because the way the movie is happening is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing but it's definitely worth it
<START> homicide the movie proved to be a good wrap up to a well written well directed and well acted series loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season the entire series and especially the movie provided a life like look at life and death in baltimore a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore but once i experienced life here for myself i realized how realistic it was and the movie certainly retained that spirit i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city
<START> the first ever fully synchronized sound cartoon walt disney's mickey mouse makes his screen debut in the exceptionally entertaining cartoon short subject steamboat willie mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of captain peg leg pete or pete as he would later be called mickey boards his long time companion minnie mouse aboard the train as they frolic about while mickey attempts to impress minnie this short was wildly fun and positively entertaining animators rudolph ising and hugh harman assisted walt on the creation of the short steamboat willie essentially marks the beginning of the success of the walt disney company
<START> especially when looking at the amount of crap that has made it to dvd i found this movie very funny rip torn is classic with his barbs rob schneider if hilariously annoying as the over compensating ensign bruce dern makes a great villain the entire cast seems to be having a blast and it's not at the expense of the audience if you like just plain fun comedy and aren't looking too deeply into meaning you just might fall in love with this one
<START> one of the greatest crimes made against sci fi television was the cancellation of farscape one of the most well written well acted and over all best shows ever to grace the airwaves it set new standards for sci fi television once the flagship highest rated critically show of the sci fi channel it defies explaination as to why shows like buffy tremors the series and even stargate sg 1 have lasted as long as they have yes even buffy but i'll save my buffy bashing for another time farscape was poorly treated by the sci fi channel continually tossed around in scheduling reruns rarely shown and never really advertised but while the show has been cancelled all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back even henson company ceo brian henson there is also an extensive fan based movement to bring the show back overall things are looking far from dark and hopefully fans will get their season 5
<START> all i can say is i really miss this show my wife i just got married around the time this show started up why did cbs take it off the air i think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy it made me laugh it also made me cry but when cbs took it off the air my wife i thought cbs made a big mistake you know what would be so great have a reunion show that would be so cool anybody know if it is on dvd yet on the last season of promised land did cbs show the whole last season i think cbs took it off the air at mid season my wife i will never forget it the opening with that theme song was fantastic this show only comes once in a life time may we never forget promised land
<START> i guess this is in the public domain as its out on dvd first off this is a feel good propaganda movie to be shown to a wartime aussie audience so its not to be considered a serious retelling of tobruk the first half to 3 4 is very dry stuff set in australia i guess like many american war films where the recruits are getting together oh man its soooo long than we get to africa and tobruk pretty bad low budget stuff the battle scenes on the dvd copy i watched were almost completely black see it if you must but be prepared to use the fast forward as i doubt you can take it after a few minutes i enjoyed the cheesy italian battle of el a whole lot more also richard burton did an african theater war flick that was good the desert rats this movie is just a real period piece and should have stayed in that time does not hold up well today i doubt it was highly regarded back then either i say the same thing about my american counterpart war flicks so don't take it personally aussies i love australia been there twice
<START> this is the thirteenth falcon film tom conway has lost none of his humour and style and is not showing signs of getting tired the film has a very satisfying story with lots of red herrings suspects and dames madge meredith is the good girl of the story she plays it adequately but by no means sets the screen on fire myrna dell is a bad girl and she puts on an excellent face of stone with eyes of and you are just waiting for her to kill as many people as possible to cheer herself up edward brophy is back as goldie the sidekick but surprise surprise his manic over acting has stopped and he is actually under control this is a fine tribute to the directorial skills of william a who had done so many westerns he probably was not prepared to take any nonsense from a brooklyn dummy the result is that for the first time possibly in his career brophy was toned down enough actually to add something to a film rather than try the viewer's patience with the irritating behaviour of a retarded but unruly six year old it all goes along very well and is thoroughly entertaining
<START> for once a sequel to the karate kid without ralph macchio hilary swank did an excellent job playing the orphan julie pierce pat morita the one who plays mr miyagi worked his way with julie quite different from daniel both daniel and julie favored karate unlike daniel julie was the most surly person miyagi ever challenged and there was no tournament to compete in and there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well i liked the part where when julie came home from school miyagi went to check on her and saw her change clothes in the process that was very funny and the classic wax on wax off scene was different as well it was funny when miyagi tells julie uh oh missed spot the set in boston was a far cry from california the militant group in that group was like the cobra kai in boston and michael ironside's col dugan was no john his group practically deserted him when julie kicked some serious butt they all paid the price when they blew up that classic what a cowardly act at least they'll find redemption from poison this karate kid sets some morals unlike the last three which talked about honor and respect hilary swank is outstandingly hot in any movie and everything else she does movie 9 hilary swank 10
<START> this is one of the great modern kung fu films a lot of the reviews seem to miss the point that the comedy is based on a quite subtle at times at other times right in your face contrast between old and new china kara hui for instance is called a country bumpkin and gets into trouble whenever she tries to adapt to the new but in the end to save her families honour dresses as an old fashioned heroine in contrast to the modern military style of hsiao ho gordon liu seems to have played his part for laughs playing off his serious monk persona with silly wigs and a guitar the end fight is simply fantastic and ends in a defeat for johnny wang rather than death kwan yung moon should be mentioned for his great playing of a thug with simply terrific and kara hui does some magnificent acting and fighting a great film
<START> i always wanted to see this film and when i finally got to i knew i was in for a nice surprise when john boorman's name appeared on the screen known mostly for his epic films he directed the first conan and wrote apocalypse now put together in the classic hollywood structure this one fits nicely with his catalog br br i also can't express how perfect the timing was considering that burma is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the military junta run government which is the very same one there has been a change of leadership since but it's essentially the same depicted in the movie from 1988 now more than ever this film needs to be aired on television caught it on ifc because of recent events
<START> these immortal lines begin the jack directed masterpiece 'the dion brothers' the plot centers around two blue collar west brothers stacy keach and frederic forrest who commit robberies in hopes of using the money to open a seafood restaurant what follows is quite an adventure and many comedic events ensue the action scenes are all top notch and consist of some nicely realized shootouts the latter of which is absolutely amazing and occurs in an abandoned building being demolished by a wrecking ball the film was written by now famous director terrence malick and features an early appearance by margot kidder all in all an excellent hidden gem of the 70s and easily one of the finest action comedy hybrids every made hopefully it gets a decent widescreen dvd release soon
<START> this film is definitely up there with the worst films i've ever seen probably in my top 5 of worst films i laughed once and that was when br br evan im building something evan's secretary i hope its a barber shop br br that was literally the only time i laughed in this 'comedy' awful compared to bruce almighty which as a big jim carrey fan wasn't even that great br br this movie lacked the humour of having god's powers and was more about family bonding id class it solely as a family movie definitely not a family comedy br br seeing a bird poo on someone's shirt is not hilarious neither is a beard that grows back instant br br i didn't even think the special effects were great the animals looked really stuck on it was like watching a film which hadn't been together properly br br 2 10 film avoid
