<START> just a short comment i want to say that i like this movie very much sandra bullock is my favourite actress i like the whole story from the beginning until the end i have it on tape and i can watch it a 100 times it doesn't matter
<START> in december 1945 a train leaves the central station of stockholm for berlin there aren't much left when it arrives not of the train and not of some passengers br br this is a black comedy directed by peter dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed in b w like they used to during that period the actors must have had lots of fun making it they aren't much of characters like they weren't in the 40s but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing br br a deadly black and deadly funny film see it if you didn't think the swedes were capable of humour
<START> the most generic surface level biography you could hope for busey's impersonation of holly is accurate but who wants to hear gary busey sing maybe baby typically the members of the are used for comic relief and melodrama smith and stroud respectively instead of as people or even characters when holly uses a string section the old jewish looking guys who come in tell him he's using the same techniques as mozart it's just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this and amadeus about the aforementioned mozart so worthless some entertainment can be derived from holly's excellent styles and songs done in a b variation
<START> this is one of my 3 favorite movies i've been out on the water since i was 13 so i got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the near land scenery the movie although taking place in and around virginia was filmed around the san francisco bay most notably the fleet just east of the bridge where kelsey grammar's character was first introduced to the uss stingray and the piers of san francisco at the very end of the movie including a boat that i've worked on as other people have said the actors appeared to have fun making this movie as well as making it entertaining the line we're approaching the bottom sir i can hear a couple of lobsters duking it out is at least to me priceless br br i am one of numerous people who is anxiously awaiting a letterboxed dvd of down periscope to be introduced
<START> as a local performer i thought that grease showcased what broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population although my favorites did not win but came in second i enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what i liked and where i could improve as a performer br br they brought in olivia newton john because she is the obvious link between the broadway production and television audiences br br they sang songs from the movie hopelessly devoted et al because these songs will be included in the new production br br i agree with the earlier comment made that the b'way cast looks so much older but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on broadway and worked their tails off to be there if the entire cast was green and fresh then i believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent
<START> first of all around the time i wrote this comment i had already read what 1 had written about this game and was confused this is a video game and not an actual movie i mean i myself would choose a good deniro movie or playing a video game any day but dude what are you talking about now that i have that out of the way let's move on shall we the video game adaption of crouching tiger hidden dragon is as you may have guessed based on the movie of the same name what's stranger is that this was released three years after the film was released whether that's due to a slow development time or just plain laziness no one really knows at least i don't br br the game allows the player to play as the four main characters of the movie jen shu li mu bi and dark cloud whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for separate gameplay all four of these characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the movie however the real eye candy is the evasion moves that allow each character to avoid the blows of an enemy's attack in the most impossible and gravity defying ways that were first showcased in the movie br br the story is obviously based on the story told in the movie the story in the game is told using cg movies and spoken in a subtitled mandarin language a nice little touch considering i preferred the foreign language track of the film over the dubbed one the story goes to expand on what might've happened to the other characters during the film and even no real surprise since pretty much all video game movie adaptions have done this alters what officially happened in the movie to make the game have more action i never thought jade fox would go so far as to actually go and get hired goons br br the real bonus for the story is the ability to decide how the game ends what if jen had all the ingredients to cure li mu bi in her possession what if jen had not gotten back her comb what if li mu bi had not gotten the green destiny back for the second time your actions will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the destiny of the characters in this game this is truly the best feature of the game br br yet for all it's strengths it also showcases some flaws the enemies often tend to become a nuisance after a while and the camera angle tends to be fixed on the most unhelpful of spots not even the special features which are unlocked after beating the game are good enough to even forgive such hardships that are forced upon the player br br if you loved the movie you may enjoy the game however this game is the only way you're going to be able to immerse yourself into a version of such a beautiful and amazing movie br br of course you could have just picked a deniro movie instead
<START> you don't have to be a to appreciate this gem of a movie i don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but i could make out the story because the lead actors and actresses emoted really well and the little girl was really cute she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies the story is really touching and hats off to mr for trying something different the relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically i could identify with the characters in the movie it was a movie that will remain in my heart forever and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my friends also the songs are just out of this world they were beautifully and meaningfully picturised if only i could understand the right meaning of the lyrics
<START> this movie deals with the european erasmus exchange program but more generally about the european youth it is so true that i don't know did to reach such a masterpiece definitely one of my top 5 movies it reminds me of the famous song this is my life my life life is life 10 10
<START> you could get into the nitty gritty of this film and say how it couldn't happen or how could the main character just walk into offices and start using computers etc without someone noticing and really pick the movie to bits or you could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting personally i prefer the latter i live real life and watch the news with all it's doom and gloom and so would much rather be entertained by my movies and see the bad guys get their just rewards don't take it too seriously and you can thoroughly enjoy this film
<START> the accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix a lot of sadness i'm sure glad that i wasn't him another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really pretty accounts of the real women but i don't think that it was about the women although it was to jfk jr's passion what a shame any loss of life is a real shame br br seemed like a good account of his life i recommend it if you are into biographies and melodrama
<START> i was one chosen to see this movie in a sneak preview br br first you should know that this film is based on the video game far cry a for its time really good game 2004 second you should know that the of this flick is the great uwe boll this is a man who takes video games dungeon siege bloodrayne postal etc and makes movies out of them very horrible ones br br i still remember when i saw boll's the king's swords a dungeon siege tail there were so horrible mistakes in this film like 3 scenes playing at the same time 2 at day time and one somehow at night br br so lets come to far cry if you expect cool action forget it really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far away from real action if you expect a cool story forget it by the not so bad story of the game this movie is a laugh the actors' playing makes the movie in a lot of moments funny but in a no good way br br i had the chance to see this movie for free so do not do the mistake and pay for this trash its one of my flicks for the bottom 100
<START> when this movie was on br br what a bore an attempt at humor but really not pulling it off too well some good ideas were cast and the actors makeup and wardrobe were ok br br i expected a lot more unfortunately i couldn't sit through any more of it i switched off halfway through the video and ejected the tape went to the rental store to get my money back
<START> in a future where an industrious travel agency uses time travel technology to send wealthy clients back in time for explorations to the age of dinosaurs the future is inexplicably changed when one of their clients breaks the cardinal rule not to stray off the path in an attempt to fix the damage done a seasoned time scout edward burns teams with the inventor of the technology catherine mccormack br br the premise is pretty good and engaging it may have a few flaws in it but it could still make for an interesting movie unfortunately a sound of thunder fails to really hook the audience in it suffers from a number of problems and it takes itself way too seriously so it's hard to actually have any fun while watching the movie personally i thought the script was the film's biggest problem the were more plot holes than expected and the movie was kind of lazy in explaining things i was hoping for a more in depth look into the butterfly effect but the film was more escapist fun than anything else that's okay with me since 90 minutes of mindless fun is still a nice way to spend an evening however all the fun this film offered was unintentional and lame there were a few scenes that kept me entertained but i was pretty bored br br the acting isn't much better since most of them seem more interested in a paycheck than anything else the only person that gave a good performance was ben kingsley he kept the first half of the film enjoyable and he seemed to be having the most fun as well edwards burns was pretty pale and bland i don't think he has what it takes to be a leading man however he could make for a decent supporting actor catherine mccormack was just really annoying and not very believable i haven't really seen her in anything else but she could have potential the rest of the actors also give bad performances though most of them are relatively unknown so it shouldn't effect their careers too much br br looking at the message boards most people are complaining about the special effects there's no way to them and they are terrible all the dinosaurs look really bad the lizards part monkey part dino while a creative idea become stale after awhile and they are most likely to encourage laughter rather than fear the green screen work just looks awful and unprofessional i was really wondering what director peter was trying to accomplish here he fails to deliver the suspense action and thrills and makes this movie a long sit for the most part though the film is pretty harmless and it's far from the worst movie of 2005 hopefully they will remake this film in the future there is potential in this project but for now this is the best we got in the end unless curiosity gets the better of you there is no reason to see a sound of thunder rating 4 10
<START> this is a really obnoxious show it is in fact an example of how low television has fallen since 'reality' got in style tanya is pretty but she is also extremely rude and has awful taste is a house show the place for sex appeal apparently some males like the show because they find tanya attractive the other boss is not pretty but he's fully as rude and also has awful taste it is unfortunate that so many houses have to be shown while someone is still living in them most of the people who are allegedly viewing these houses before changes are made should be moving into brand new houses or completely empty ones so they will not be insulting anyone most of them like the 'crew' need to be taught manners i can imagine how awful the british show is since the british reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to manners and taste br br what happened to the arts and entertainment channel when it started out and for some years afterward it was filled with treats now it's one big trash machine
<START> this movie was a sweet cutesy romantic comedy just the kind of movie i usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested it was really funny in one moment probably why i liked it and then just as serious in the next plus it had ellen in it and i've always had a soft spot for her br br basically the owner of a book store helen kate capshaw finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store she thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it she has kind of shut herself off from the world so it really throws her for a loop eventually almost everyone connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed signals which creates some really funny moments br br like i said i am usually not one for this type of movie but i really wound up enjoying it and recommend it highly
