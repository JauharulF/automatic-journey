<START> lou gossett jr is great as a super u s air force pilot who comes to the rescue of a nice but undisciplined masters' jason the son of a captured pilot who is determined to borrow a couple of f 16 fighters to use in an attempt to save his dad from a dictator david suchet of an enemy overseas country br br better than 'top gun' this air force aviation film has excitement and lots of explosions you know all that cool stuff you'd want from a contemporary military adventure film br br cool music including twisted sister's dee snider belting out 'we're not gonna take it' and king excellent 'never say die' br br aim high air force
<START> i did not like this film at all the scenario is boring and after a while its primitive predictability really gets on your nerves even if you give chabrol a high bonus for not being a beginner i did not manage to find anything specially interesting on his characterization of neither
<START> if you are looking for king kong you your search this is a low low budget movie that was ment to entertain people in a comic sense here is the most ordinary human who is the only 1 who can save the world from a 300 ton surely you can see the humor in that
<START> on a second viewing this is still a wonderful romance that is in my opinion much better than the film it came paired with on my 2 dvd set the leo mccarey weepie classic an affair to remember yet it seems to have fallen out of favour slightly only a 6 6 rating here on imdb and dismissed by many critics as gooey slush how sad because this is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by the two leads jennifer jones and william holden if anything the film should be well remembered for the gorgeous colour cinematography and the unforgettable musical score i don't much like valentine's day but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again and i'm glad of it while i still think holden's character death is too heavily foreshadowed taking suspense out of the final scenes this film is very moving and i really enjoy it
<START> just saw this movie 2 days ago a very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine i have no special interest in wine and yet i found this very enlightening the director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are while he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer he shows a lot of compassion to people and dogs and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don't want to tell br br the movie shows us where our world is going to what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay it is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big personal and global character and formula br br the real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves br br it takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing but it's worth it br br highly recommended
<START> do you hear that sound that's the sound of h g wells rolling over in his grave between this version and spielberg's cinematic abortion it's been a tough year for the classic novel but at least steven got a few things right compared to this hello the ships weren't big insects they had names they were tripods and the aliens worked in threes the ships and the aliens were all wrong you don't really get to see the aliens until the end the effects and the cast work fine but these actors are much better then this movie deserves the bulk if not all the movie is the howell character wondering through the devastation meeting one person they join him and he looses them for one reason or the other there's not more then two people on camera at any given moment though most of the movie it's like if they filmed three at once it would put the movie over budget or something so fat the only and mean only watchable adaptation of the war of the worlds story is the george pal version way back in the 1950s the black hole
<START> i'm still laughing not i'm still asking my myself what the point was i barely got a chuckle this movie sucks it tries to be charming and touching but it turns out stupid i do not recommend it
<START> actually son of the mask did make me laugh a few times mostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made bugs bunny and roadrunner so funny the cgi is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie garfield for example is no where on par for cgi but i would give it the same vote br br everyone knows the story which wasn't that bad for a kids movie yes it is a kids movie and therefore should be treated as such jamie kennedy is not very good in his role his attempts to act crazy are not very good and overall acting is poor br br everyone else is not too bad br br basically my 2 and 5 year old watched the whole thing without complaining at least i was able to sit through this br br there is no way this movie is worst than shudder class of 1999 br br 4 10 for the cgi and a few laughs
<START> i really like the movie's opening when col ted masters realizes on his fighter radar that four enemy aircraft were approaching from about 10 o'clock the good news is that the movie does not mention at the very beginning that the colonel along with a fighter who was a lieutenant was trying to do a freedom of navigation exercise along the eastern meditteranean sea but went a little too past the restricted air space zone reserved for a rogue middle eastern nation as they fly past it br br i also like all of the intercutting on the colonel's fighter radar and computer displays as the enemy aircraft aggressively picks the two american fighter pilots into an engagement for violating their airspace that first dogfight immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot movie top gun from the waxing of the enemy bandits to the enemy thirty rounds that struck the colonel's jet engines and forcing the plane down forcing him to eject all of this reminds us of one thing dogfight fighter techniques can keep you alive but one false move can cause you to be shot down br br the only problem in the movie was the snake sequence scene it was a little bit too long yes the movie's opening was great when you see the conflict which was the dogfight engagement only when one boy tells doug masters that his father was shot down after the cessna planes landed in the snake race forces us back to the time the conflict already started i guess the snake sequence in the middle should be interrupted a little bit by col masters being dragged in handcuffs in the middle of the desert on his way to the detention center while the music sequence for the snake continues the film does not do it if it were the details would have been smoother at that point still good otherwise br br when word found out that col ted masters trial for high treason violating territorial air sovereignty was over and he was condemned to be hung on the gallows in three days doug masters decides to go into action with the air force having futile attempts to save the man doug decides to pull his friends and col sinclair played by louis gossett jr for a plan to rescue masters risking a high chance of facing a court martial and spending more than a year in a military stockade he goes against air force policy and makes a plan to rescue masters without consent of the u s government br br doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to get plenty of stuff on the area where masters is held for the upcoming hanging and the surrounding area around which turns out to be a fake middle eastern country for the movie one plan included shooting off firecrackers outside the air force darkroom area as a diversion to get classified photos and maintenance stuff on the fighter aircraft fighter base intelligence and all of the other military stuff around br br when all was said and done and sinclair studied all of the intelligence he almost rebuffed at that plan because doug was way too cocky not until they get the two f 16 planes and tried a dry run across a firing range that i realized what they were going to do overseas i realized that fighter shooting and bomb dropping is not good until he hears rock music i can remember when he dropped one mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb missed by 20 feet i realized that doug is unusual he likes music when he fires the fighter ammunition br br the last part of the conflict the final dogfight action in iron eagle was better than top gun's climax of the hostile dogfight sequences i liked the way the final conflict unfolded especially when doug masters faces off with an middle eastern ace fighter pilot who actually ran the trial against ted masters short but sweet when doug took the enemy fighter out after a second try by a side missile looks like this colonel was akin to darth vader in star wars in the air he can be very evil because if you have seen star wars darth vader was actually anakin skywalker who was an ace pilot in space unusual connotation for this but still works
<START> i came across the last stop one day at a video store and they were selling it for only 2 i decided to give it a try and bought it it was pretty good i enjoyed it the story is about several people all caught in a cabin somewhere in nowhere because of a raging blizzard there is a police officer nancy his ex girlfriend two brothers that just got out of jail a older man and his lover a black man and the couple that owns the cabins and their retarted son that never speaks suddenly someone is found to be murdered and a bag full of cash is found everyone is a suspect the last stop is a pretty good thriller i would give it 8 10
<START> i borrowed this on dvd from a friend the other day i didn't really know what to expect i haven't seen a lot of russian movies and i don't think i've ever seen a russian war movie maybe that made me expect something different something more along the line of an imagined russian mentality but whatever those expectations came from they were put to shame as this is a quite ordinary war movie br br the whole formula of following a few young people from their recruitment through training to deployment and through some battles is well known we have seen it done both many years ago as well as more recently as with jarhead sure there's a difference here because the movie is about russian soldiers instead of americans as is almost always the case but in general this could just as easily have been a vietnam movie i guess that just underscores my feeling that afghanistan was the soviet unions vietnam a country that should have been a pushover for a superpower made the war drag on for years with terrible loss of life both for soldiers and civilians br br the good points in this movie i felt were good photography there are some beautiful ambiance shots and decent effects for what i guess must have been a rather low budget movie what made me disappointed is mostly the story itself it just doesn't manage to stir any emotion in me mostly because the character development is lousy and to really feel something when people are gunned down you have to make them people not just faceless cardboard cutouts they fail to do that in this movie also it's overly long and that seems to a kind of trend lately in my opinion a movie that's more than two hours long has to have a lot to offer and this movie doesn't cut it also there is a disturbing music that's put like a wet blanket over every scene especially in the action scenes this is highly disturbing not that you need action music but something more than just slow keyboard music would be nice otherwise the production values were good enough that was not where the problem was br br i don't know how to view this movie as a reminder of the fact that no matter where you are war sucks that russian film makers have already watched too many american war movies to make something original regardless of which this movie is rather clichÃ©d lacks in spirit and while it has acceptable technical qualities it lacks in script and character development in the end it just becomes another of all those war movies that fails to make you think and fails to add something to the genre i've seen a lot worse but a lot better too i rate this 4 10
<START> the cell is weak on plot filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well but none of this matters for director singh has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever the whole plot is just an excuse to let fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer bringing the audience some shocking pleasing breath taking and mind blowing images br br the images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come this movie is a perfect case for the suspension of disbelief theory forget the silly plot just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images and j lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of work the cinematography is harrowing the music haunting the costumes just stunning br br the movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art its just that the medium is not canvas anymore it is the big screen and celluloid one of the most refreshing movies of this decade the cell is a must watch a bold new step in movie making br br an enthralling 8
<START> for those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships 51 birch street is a must see br br by training the spotlight on his own family block covers terrain that is off limits for most filmmakers he explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism in fact the film is deceptively low key at the outset br br in addition to providing a probing look at one family and by extension every family block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history i don't know if this was intentional but unavoidable due to archival content br br highly recommended
<START> after watching ingmar bergman's i had many feelings but most notably i felt unsatisfied i have heard so much hype about this movie but i came to find it lacking don't get me wrong i can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film but as far as depth and emotion i was not so impressed i found the characters to be disagreeable and unrealistic which detracted from the dramatic effect in addition the fact that the war was fake led me to feel that the emotion was not real dramatic war movies in my opinion are much more effective if the events not necessarily the story itself really happened i find that of all the movies that try to show the brutality this one falls in the middle as far as effectiveness
<START> there was a time when not all animation was disney or pixar its so nice to see this wonderful film again and i actually got hold of a good reasonable copy on dvd be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around i got a very good copy by a company called flashbacks and its quite good in the old days i watched it on black and white on tv and its magic to see it in colour very much better than some would have you believe the songs are delightful and the colour is great interestingly the characters are really well developed which is odd in animated movies i loved and the villain mr beatle is a real cad its incredibly imaginative the way inanimate objects like cotton reels old tins become part of the environment and have new functions is great the use of insects is amazing considering the much creatures most people sadly think are repugnant hopefully we may never step on an insect again the insects enemy is man in reality of course its the insects that will survive no matter how hard we try to rid ourselves of ants here in australia they keep coming back the battle has been lost and we have to live with them there are several scenes that stand out such as when and mr bumble are caught in a watering can the great flood and the journey to the top of the building are all wonderful its also rather anthropomorphic but in a way thats charming the human characters look very like the ones in gulliver and its incredibly effective the wedding scene looks beautiful its a crime this movie has not been hailed as a classic the only jarring note for me is the occasions in the film when the characters slip into verse speaking verse spoils the narration and it was no needed the verse is awful and spoils an other wise good script its great and kids will love it its a joy to look at there's a very clever ending too
