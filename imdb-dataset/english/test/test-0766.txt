<START> this film has its detractors and fey dresser may offend some folks who frankly need a good smack upside the head but the film is top notch in every way engaging poignant relevant finney naturally is larger than life courtney makes an ideal foil i thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads and character provides plenty of dark humor the period is well captured the supporting cast well chosen this is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial i only wish it were out on dvd already sigh
<START> bergman's is one of the most realistic depictions of war ever set to film this is not an action film by any means though the pacing is faster and there is most action than in most any other bergman movie nor is this a of war or patriotism unlike most war movies in fact the gritty realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalties has a very contemporary feel br br is a darkly lit movie that should be watched at night so as to let it work it's magic many of the effects are conveyed indirectly but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity to a contemporary insanely huge budget film like saving private ryan of course the action in is on a much smaller scale but it is impressive none the less br br while the film making style feels contemporary the setting of the film feels timeless and the war torn countryside and even the yet intact provincial hamlet could be anywhere any time and this film is not so much about specific historical events with specific names and dates but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos br br the acting in though typically impressive from ullman and sydow is not of primary importance in this film unlike most other bergman movies through much of the film they are spectators much as we are bergman has the war imposed on them and through them on the audience and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions might be br br highly recommended 10 10
<START> the comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate i feel exactly the same way that i am very disappointed at how far rick mercer has fallen when he used to do some really great things on this hour has 22 minutes but now he is just clowning around going places and talking to people he does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses etc he used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving this hour has 22 minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more now that air farce is off the air finally thank goodness mercer and this hour has 22 minutes have got to be next in line for the axe just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more it's sad really considering rick mercer used to be the funniest man on canadian tv
<START> i love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great american sitcom i watched five episodes of this abomination and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job the rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom i loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots one who got laid and the other who didn't getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students the british girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass the hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot and the principal and her lackey that served to somehow move the almost non existent plot forward i loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young but i ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had did they look like that or did you go to the high school that had middle aged people teaching in it that is the high school that everyone else went to the show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools in public schools principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers the school board does but in every episode that i watched the principal made threats to fire her teachers think back to your history class or think of any history class did you ever see an incredibly hot british chick teach an american history class no did you ever see a teacher's lounge that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in no br br teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality what makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out the overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines and i'm sorry i just didn't buy it the show could have modeled itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single camera format and it should have centered more around the teacher's relationships with their students and not with each other br br it gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick she was really hot br br in the end it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession i only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen
<START> i watched the movie yesterday and for me it was a stunning combination of movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs the best of the best it was never any dull and always moving every hour there's another character bothering trying to kill him you never know what's next in one word terrific
<START> this is an extraordinary film as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening for butler the consequences of this system could be devastating this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court in truth the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty or a guilty man being free every citizen has a right to justice whether a perpetrator or a victim but do they get it the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen
<START> this is without a doubt the most hilarious movie i've ever seen seriously if the makers of this movie are ever discovered they'll put guys like jim carrey out of a job rent jack o tonight believe me you won't regret it
<START> an interesting and involved film about a lifer just trying to live out his days peacefully elements of the main character appear in michael mann's later films like thief 1981 heat 1995 and so on you can see this one at the ucla instructional media laboratory one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public it's a great one
<START> when something can be anything you want it to be or mean it's bound to register with someone as being rather special but just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship and to another of his aunt's rear and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the viewers' interpretation anyone who might find throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window brilliant or worthwhile for that matter without relating it in some context is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her intellectuality br br submitting to this movie as the dreams of a madman does quite nicely especially since there is no standard or expectation for what said dreams would be like and even if we were mad ourselves this would hardly give us sane reference points for comparison a love affair with this movie entails the same risk as seriously interpreting nostradamus whatever real meaning was being conveyed at the time might be buried in the private jokes musings or provincial minutiae of its day and to a select few radical intellectuals at that i did spot a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity though br br the movie is definitely anti fascist and to some extent anti italian i noted that although the years 1929 30 were years of great public works and urban renewal in italy any indication of this seemed avoided furthermore avant academic take note of this for your next class the very short cropped haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of victor emmanuel iii and his tall female companion none other than queen helen formerly princess of montenegro without an understanding of potential historical relevance even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academic or other intellectual poseurs who would in irrelevance to impress us br br i gladly add my own paint buckets to the defacement of this cinematic joke but in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy the movie really has no face to paint would help it burn though
<START> watched this piece ondemand because the description was kind of outlandish this film stinks of cocaine the opening scene alone must have cost at least five figures in blow to film this is a racist homophobic piece of garbage that plods along for a good 1hr and with absolutely no direction i am a little confused on how this has good reviews here i won't bother telling you the plot line because as far as i can tell there is no plot i'm pretty sure everyone showed up to the set everyday did giant lines dressed loretta in plunging necklines to show as much flapjack as possible and yelled action letting the cast improvise in a cocaine frenzy much like real beer this movie nearly caused my liver to fail half way through save your money and watch 'strange instead
<START> although i am sure the idea looked good on paper and it appealed to me when i first heard of it this movie often lumbers along and falls flat and when i watch it i just want it to end the bookend beginning and ending of the film about lou having to babysit a troublemaker is contrived at best although i found the tall cop part to be humorous however i found little to laugh at with the bottom of the barrel script that was thrown together for these two great comedians i thought that it was a mistake to put them in a musical and it reeks of wizard of oz rip off with the songs and black and white to color format i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone but die hard a c fanatics anyone else will be disappointed and they have many better films
<START> i saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it so charming and so very romantic david duchovny and ms driver have chemistry that is so hot you will need to take off a layer of clothing the supporting cast is 100 top notch just watching caroll o'connor and robert loggia play off one another is pure poetry bonnie hunt and jim and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen like jim belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep forever or him dancing in the kitchen this film made we wish i knew people like that in my own life not to mention what woman does not want david duchovny for a boyfriend
<START> my review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself br br 1 plants eating people have been done hundreds of times it's been used by nintendo in everything from mario to zelda to metroid prime it's been used in plenty of low budget 50's movies on par with the lowest of the godzilla franchise and this brings it to a whole another level of cheese with plants that talk i've known no one who walked out but i know a lot of people who absolutely broke out in hysteric laughing during parts of this movie i was one of them doesn't the horror genre deserve something a little better than this pile of laughable crap br br 2 the characters easily could have been copy pasted from hostel or wrong turn or wolf creek or any other movie with collage kids with bad luck yet it's called characterizing when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clichÃ©s that hundreds of characters before have had don't you ever wish a movie had characters that weren't just forgettable pieces of meat with legs br br 3 this was not gory a guy cuts his skin off oh my not a guy gets his legs broken oh my gasp not i have shown movies like this to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick and she said i've seen pg movies worse than that why was it rated r so why was it rated r br br 4 here's the only plot the movie book has collage kids drink have sex get naked cruse bleed and eventually die this is possibly the most typical example of a cheap thoughtless horror movie yet people call this mature what the br br 5 i do not think i have ever seen something less original sense i watched a beautiful mind br br haven't you ever sat there and wished the horror genre easily the most diverse genre out there would do something well diverse something truly original br br i just wish more horror movies would have actual horror not just cheap collage parties put on film with a few splatters of fake blood tossed around br br 1 10
<START> almost certainly staged montage of women reading lines very briefly and getting naked not very briefly in front of a anonymous and uncredited panel almost certainly including producer charles band thrown in are random scenes of surrender cinema's many movies primarily lesbian scenes most of the women like riding horses hmmm there is a polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to an audition a 'secret camera that films actresses getting naked behind the screen br br jacqueline lovell too made up but still beautiful introduces a couple of her own movie scenes and talks in a way to the camera if you enjoy lesbian scenes the one with lovell and vanesa taylor from is included and they are probably the best looking lesbian ever weird excuse for a movie and aside from the obvious draw of naked women a frankly dull and uninspiring experience
<START> this thing oh god this thing i can't even call it a movie a movie is something that does something goes somewhere has some semblance of a plot or something i don't know how i'm doing it i really don't first i say dark fields is the worst movie ever and i thought it was then pirates of ghost island proved me wrong and now third time in a row another film goes above and beyond the call of duty to prove me wrong br br sighs ok dark harvest ii the maize lord this is awful let me break it down for you man senses daughters are in danger through some magical psychic powers he got from his act ii popcorn apparently and races to find them in a corn field of course this is the cornfield in all of existence being the size of the cornfields from jeepers creepers children of the corn and signs combined the main character whose name is shy awesome name btw then runs through a corn field finds some ghost girls talks to them and runs through a corn field digs a while and runs through a corn field and the incredibly sad thing i'm really not leaving anything out that pretty much is the entire movie the only thing i may be leaving out is how he gets chased by two policemen who want to arrest him for i don't know pretending to be an actor i didn't care by this point he gets away and the police are by the killer offscreen holy crap there's a killer apparently yes there is as he's introduced nearly 4 5 into the movie but wait then he runs away for a while and there's you guessed it more running through the corn field and digging then there's the ending where he saves his daughters huzzah br br the biggest problem with this movie is it's boring it's incredibly inhumanly tremendously boring i can't explain how atrociously dull this thing is nothing happens the characters are as appealing as a root canal and it's just an hour and a half of nothing the only good thing that came out of this movie was that me and my friend may have found enlightenment due to the near nirvana state this movie put us into after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to kick into overdrive to keep us alive during the ensuing insanity i found hugging a wall much more enjoyable and my friend found a new passion for laughing hysterically while flopping all over the floor as if he having a seizure this is the sort of insanity this movie brings it's not just bad it's bad for your health the cover looks awesome with a picture of an awesome scarecrow killer that i would totally consider dressing up as for a horror con but this was the most misleading box ever don't let it fool you too do not watch this movie watch a better corn movie any movie about corn is better just don't let it get you don't a 0 out of 10
