<START> i saw this on mystery science theater 3000 and even that show couldn't really make this movie bearable i could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures of course you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old but i've seen silents that were better the storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes the cameraman apparently doesn't know what a tripod is and had too much coffee or something harder maybe because the camera is always shaking around i couldn't even follow the plot but suffice it to say this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life br br update i saw epic movie a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2 it's not the worst movie i've ever seen anymore
<START> i loved this film almost as much as the origional version what teenager doesn't go through what going through wanting to find independence by getting more and more distant from your family the songs were nice to and the character designs were great lady and tramp look almost exactly like they did in the origional feature they did a good job on the voices of those two too considering the fact that the origional voice actors are probably dead however i do think they should've given more lines to lady annette colette and daniel oh well at least they had the common sense to keep the same scenery from the original film
<START> i have to be honest i really had a good time watching she's the man despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the sexes movie it had some pretty decent laughs that i think anyone could get adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie br br amanda bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a guy and when she is turned down to try out for the boy's soccer team she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boy's soccer team of course love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she's her brother she also has a girl who is chasing after her well the tag line says it all br br this is a fun little teen drama that i think will be remembered for a while amanda bynes did prove something in the film it's really hard to really act like a guy d well it's true br br 8 10
<START> the bridge the sound of is one of the best music documentaries that i have seen lately and is more than a film about music it is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city one of the greatest city in europe and the world one of the most important cities for europe history and for islam the city that may bridge in the future europe and the middle east or may signify once again as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds br br then there is the music the interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music and we hear a lot of good rock and rap in the first third of the film an then like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots to turkish traditional music to commercial romances and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of turkish music in such a complex and conflict ridden country as turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects like censorship introduced by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the kurdish one one of the best musical moments is actually provided by a kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral shaped turkish bath br br one gets to love the city and its music by the end of the viewing and hearing of this film i have never been to istanbul but after having seen this film i am sure that i want to visit this place soon
<START> two hands is a hilarious australian gangster movie set in really sultry sydney i bet tourists never sydney and bondi to look like it did in this film all sweaty bodies oppressive nighttime and gangsters in shorts and heath ledger plays an amateur boxer with an eye on becoming part of the local king's cross boss's gang he looked rather magnificent in his green wife beater and blue patterned smuggler a sweaty tattooed bod does become him i always had him down as a home away boy and he has been in that soap which is a little sweatier than the insipid neighbours the film is really worth watching for its combination of sardonic humour and nasty violence the drowning scene is expected to give me nightmares soon totty awards country girl love interest city brother and tattooed
<START> stay alive stay alive stay alive i am called the attention it was the trailer and not the cartel br br the topic of the movie centred on a video i play that was created by a countess to kill the people and to live eternally is acceptable br br first that quite bad movie of horror the blood sees more or less sparked spread gossip these scenes is bled they are the more bad br br but actually indeed that bad is this movie very very bad but bad in all the aspects br br i do not recommend this movie to anybody trailer well movie bad br br i do not deal since as like they spend consume money and time doing these senseless movies and too bad
<START> fc de only reason for existence is it's local popularity it has caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years and still counting br br it deals about an amateur soccer team with the emphasis amateur every storyline deals with the same subject some misunderstanding that takes ridiculous and predictable proportions to get resolved in the end br br the show's been running for over 15 years now and the production probably decided not to change a winning team which means that the show has had minor changes over the course of years besides a couple of actors getting replaced they nearly all left by themselves rather than being thrown of the show the humor hasn't changed a bit over the years and it was already outdated when it first aired in the first place br br i guess you have to be flemish to get this and over 60 years old to enjoy such an old fashioned tv show as this
<START> a real sudsy soap opera here as spencer tracy tackles the role of an illiterate until the age of 20 he marries the woman who teaches him and her ambition and his drive leads him to success br br success but no happiness here a do well son and a faltering marriage leads to disaster and tragedy tracy buys a railroad and succeeds only to be subjected to a disastrous rail strike and the death of workers br br the film appeared at the beginning to be uneven but is rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here br br a double separate suicide here we know that riches can't buy happiness but this is a little too far fetched nonetheless we have riveting performances by tracy and colleen moore ms vinson as the 2nd wife is also quite effective
<START> favourite from the first run of season 10 and also one of my personal favourites features the adventure of al gore before going on global warming and before the movie it was similar a adventure certainly al gore was also trying to aware the world about something that can change the earth something really dangerous this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig al gore had only one thing in mind to aware everyone of and to kill it al gore here is more than hilarious everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can childish doing tantrums since nobody believes him but he is just a f demented bastard basically four kids are trapped in a cave because of al gore but certainly he don't have that in his mind there's not space for any other subject is just what concerns al gore those four kids are cartman kenny kyle and stan basically stan felt sorry for al gore and the four boys were just playing in al gore's game never imaging that gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill hilarious scene they are just children damned so at this part we have on one hand all the stuff with the rescue team who also feel sorry for al gore and on the other hand we have a little yet extremely hilarious cartman episode and there are not surprises of the attitude of cartman after he finds a treasure inside the cave certainly the whole stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick cartman in both senses he is really sick for the boys and really sick for us and in the end al gore does killed this character is a fantastic one and i'm cereal terrific fun in this episode a highly re watchable one 10 out of 10
<START> this movie probably isn't the funniest i've ever seen and it certainly doesn't have much redeeming value in fact it is really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot however this make it up as i go along attitude actually works to the film's advantage tommy boy succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the snl skits farley and spade starred in succeeded their well timed extemporaneous silliness and mayhem makes them humorous despite their immaturity
<START> i know one is not supposed to comment on other comments but i will say that a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew quite a lot about the manhattan project and were annoyed at things that were left out from his book in it appears the original screenwriter bruce robinson is another such i knew very little before watching the film however and found it dwight schultz is absolutely mesmeric as oppenheimer a truly magnetic charismatic presence an inspired piece of casting that makes me wonder why he isn't given better roles and more leading parts john cusack and paul newman are excellent as always one could quibble with various script or direction choices but as it is the film is extremely intense and horrific at times and overall i give it four stars out of five
<START> joe was first released in the us in the summer of 1970 despite respectable notices reasonable box office and an oscar nom it vanished shortly afterwards and remained forgotten about throughout the 1980's before being enthusiastically reappraised somewhat unjustly in the us in the late 90's thanks to this lengthy its reputation has gone on to see it placed inexplicably alongside the likes of michael winner's original death wish although revenge is a theme a film about vigilantism this most definitely is not br br the plot isn't worth synopsizing its a flabby hammy and bizarrely stagey ramble about an accidental murder and the unlikely relationship that blossoms out of it that relationship and the largely class based quirks of its two leads are exaggerated into ridiculous caricature these two and their situation bear absolutely no relation to reality br br almost everything about the film is cantankerous and begrudgingly antiquated which makes the whole thing completely fascinating hippies are depicted as snide and exclusive misanthropes hard drugs either make you sleep or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a fly its very much a film of the 60's rather than the 70's so why some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the hollywood new wave is a complete mystery martin scorcese of all people even got involved though probably only to give a nod to the dank hues of the grim urban cinematography which almost certainly influenced taxi driver four years later but joe seems very much like a furious tirade against the likes of easy rider and bonnie and clyde rather than a continuation of that same insurgent cinematic ethos br br it isn't a film of any real artistic significance despite joe's fury at everything in his world it remains a story about absolutely nothing but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented shot on and around the streets of new york city during the darkest hours of the vietnam war and at a time when america and significantly its cinema was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard the film ends up in its own completely oblivious and accidental way saying more about that period of history than numerous infinitely superior movies that directly to capture it br br but as a film despite a really surprising and effective shock ending this is basically a michael winner film but not as well made how does that tickle your fancy incidentally if you are like me a fan of spotting arbitrary background then check out harold steptoe at 1 22 11 in the hippy art gallery
<START> we are taken to a convenience store where nick is looking at coins in his hand figuring if he can get the special a 69 cents 20 ounce cup of coffee that comes with a free pastry he decides to go for the larger size which of course is more expensive plus it doesn't qualify him for the cake he tries to argue with the indian clerk at the register who keeps her ground with her it's a matter of principle well nick gets irritated not getting his own way and proceeds to kill her br br the tone of the story is set from the start the people we are about to meet are not nice guys there are nick his girlfriend dallas and their partner billy hill they are drug dealers nick decides to visit casey his friend and former partner in crime in houston he wants to do one more transaction and then go to paris with the profits from selling the drugs he is bringing what he doesn't realize is that casey has gone straight he is an architect married to christine and wants to adopt a baby br br casey doesn't appreciate his former friend bringing drugs into the house he decides to get rid of the stuff by flushing them down the kitchen drain the untimely arrival of ice a pizza delivery man takes casey by surprise this man has been sent to kill him but before that casey brings out some weed to share with ice who has a talent for rapping br br it is at this point that dr jarvis the man from the adopting agency arrives casey's application shows a two year gap that he can't justify jarvis begins to doubt about the prospective father at this time dallas makes an entrance she is a woman that asks questions point blank like when she demands to know whether jarvis enjoys watching porn jarvis who is aroused ends up leaving in a huff dallas has decided to seduce casey at all costs there is a surprise in store as billy hill enters the picture and he doesn't like what he sees shooting dallas in the process billy hill has also come to off casey but he is overpowered br br casey gets the visit of who wants to get his money from nick in his absence he'll take it from casey gives a deadline and casey makes up his mind to outsmart all these low lives he has all the parties come to his house at an appointed hour and the different factions will take care of themselves in the end casey has a better plan that includes taking christine for a stay in paris br br never having heard about thursday we were drawn into it because of the talent in it skip woods directed his own material this seems to be a film with good intentions at times the film remember others of the same genre not a sin by any shape or form which seems to be the main objection of the negative comments left here in the imdb site for starters thursday shows a witty skip woods that has gone to write other films notably swordfish the screenplay is divided in chapters with suggestive titles pertaining to the action denis lenoir does wonders with the mostly interior photography br br thomas jane makes an excellent contribution to the film with his casey although hard to imagine he has beat the odds and made something out of himself this actor seen recently in the television series hung is one of the actors we don't tire of watching a dark haired aaron is a welcome addition to any film he is a greasy criminal that shows no redeeming qualities or anything close to remorse and doesn't hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme james legros has nothing to do same goes for a gorgeous creature that is only a distraction or an afterthought to add a sexy angle we enjoyed glenn plummer who appears as ice he does a mean audition on the telephone michael jeter and mickey rourke also appear
<START> having a close experience with one such patient is probably the best reason why i had my heart rushing throughout the entire film intense sensible moral and revealing and don't forget to check out the marvellous sound track really good
<START> i remember watching this series avidly and being so disappointed when it came to an end over the years since then i have tried to find out if i could obtain a copy of it on either video or d v d to no avail however i was delighted to find this website with details of it only to be disappointed again at the point of purchase that the videos available will not play on english recorders this production was so wonderful being absolutely accurate with novel taking the storyline through after the end of the war with joe and subsequent life together absolutely marvellous and i just wish i were able to see it again as since it's original screening there have been no repeats of it on british television
