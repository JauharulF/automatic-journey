<START> i saw a 12 45 a m show last night and i would've walked out 20 min in but there was nowhere to go blatant product placement juvenile script so much talent gone to waste gay bashing what didn't they do the movie is also insanely long we got out at 3 as a person who rarely pays full price at the movies imagine my chagrin doling out 22 for this self indulgent mean spirited nightmare plus 2 parking i woke up today still feeling depressed and haven't been able to shake it all day i love vince vaughn and he seemed straight up lost in this thing as was i when cedric the entertainer is the high water mark a man so un entertaining that he has to call himself the entertainer so you'll understand what it is he thinks he's doing you have a serious problem also the appearance of robert pastorelli is down right creepy since he died almost a year ago march 10 this should give you an idea how long they've been polishing this turd this movie is mean to the bitter end we stayed just to make sure they didn't give robert an in remembrance which they didn't save yourself save your money save your soul
<START> you will likely be sorely disappointed by this sequel that's not a sequel is a classic but this movie is about as far from being a classic as you can get what a joke special effects that aren't very special horrible dialogue non acting and a laughably ridiculous subplot quickly and unconvincingly not to mention fleeting tacked on with about a third of the movie left did i mention the story is less then lame there's no way this was supposed to be serious horror movie yet it's to stupid to be funny in any good way the rating it currently has 4 8 10 is too generous if you ask me my rating for an american werewolf in paris a 3 5 10
<START> du rififi chez les is a brilliant film which studies criminal minds and allows viewers to have a better understanding of criminals who are fundamentally not different from ordinary folks like us what director jules dassin shows is that criminal do have families and they care a lot for them that is why they adhere to a strict code of honor for them a family is not only made up of wives mistresses and children but also include casual acquaintances and close friends contrary to what many might find it hard to believe jules dassin has not tried to glorify crime in his film as rififi makes it clear that crime never pays it shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human loss apart from its philosophical stance is worth watching for its technical finesse while watching one of the film's most brilliant sequences about breaking of a safe one would find it hard to believe meticulous precision with which criminal minds execute their plans this is a scene which nobody has dared to copy in hollywood
<START> this movie is so god awful that it was literally a chore to watch i wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room but kept thinking foolishly that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right you lose we win yay this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny after that beat them the head with this movie until the tape cracks and if you're even considering renting this turd or worse yet have i have one thing to ask of you didn't you even look at the cover i mean with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is oy vey this movie sucked
<START> midnight madness is the ultimate scavenger hunt movie for all time michael j fox and paul reubens make respective pre fame appearances laughs abound everywhere and the intrigue of who will emerge victorious at the end of the great all nighter will keep you on the proverbial edge of your seat a true must see
<START> this is a very strange little short film that initially didn't impress me from a purely aesthetic point of view the animation here certainly ain't pretty though after a while you notice that the simple and silly drawings do possess a certain odd charm that's probably because with the script as screwy as this one the animation works br br the film shows an older couple sitting at the table playing scrabble at the same time they are fixated on this game or other bizarre pursuits such as the husband's compulsion to saw things even the chair and table and all of this stuff occurs as the television warns of pending atomic annihilation armageddon is definitely here naturally the neighbors are screaming and running amok during which time the couple obliviously continues with this idiotic game heck even their cat knows the end is coming as the couple begin bickering about who may or may not have cheated leading to a very surreal ending indeed the film deserves kudos for both being unique as well as very funny while it did not win the oscar it was nominated for best animated short which it richly deserved
<START> compared to the recent gore flick hostel which this movie reminded me a lot of i would say that see no evil is slightly better but not by much the very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence the kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins i guess the one thing i dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a wwe wrestler kane he ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one word lines in the movie there are a couple fairly gory moments mainly involving eye gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat probably the most effective demise in the movie br br i can't say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great can't recommend it
<START> on june 14 1905 during the russian revolution of that year sailors aboard the russian battleship potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers frustrated with the second rate treatment they receive and most particularly the maggot infested meat that they are forced to eat the ship's crew led by the inspirational bolshevik sailor aleksandr decide that the time is ripe for a revolution and so begins sergei m eisenstein's rousing classic of russian propaganda potyomkin the battleship potemkin ' br br the film itself is brimming with shining examples of stunning visual imagery the spectacles of an overthrown ship captain dangle delicately from the side rope over which he had been tossed the body of a deceased mutineer lies peaceful upon the shore the sign on his chest reading killed for a bowl of soup close up shots of the clenching fists of the hundreds of spectators who are finally fed up with the regime a wayward baby carriage careers down the odessa steps as desperate onlookers watch on with bated breath this scene was memorably borrowed by brian de palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his 'the the barrels of numerous canons are ominously leveled towards the vastly outnumbered battleship potemkin br br however the film itself is best Â not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes Â but as a single film and indeed every scene is hugely memorable though divided into five fairly distinct chapters the entire film flows forwards wonderfully at no point do we find ourselves losing interest and we are absolutely never in doubt of whose side we should be sympathetic towards br br the film is often referred to as propaganda and that is exactly what it is but this need not carry a negative connotation 'the battleship was produced by eisenstein with a specific purpose in mind and it accomplishes this perfectly in every way planned by the soviet central committee to coincide with the 20th century celebrations of the unsuccessful 1905 revolution was predicted to be a popular film in its home country symbolising the of russian arts after the revolution it is somewhat unfortunate then that eisenstein's film failed to perform well at the russian box office reportedly beaten by allan 1922 'robin film in its opening week and running for just four short weeks luckily despite being banned on various occasions in various countries 'the battleship fared more admirably overseas br br the film also proved a successful vehicle for eisenstein to test his theories of montage through quick cut editing and distant shots of the multitudes of extras the audience is not allowed to sympathise with any individual characters but with the revolutionary population in general eisenstein does briefly break this mould however in a scene where flees the ship officer who is trying to kill him and of course during the renowned odessa steps sequence as our hearts beat in horror for the life of the unfortunate child in the tumbling baby carriage the accompanying soundtrack to the version i watched largely featuring the orchestral works of shostakovich served wonderfully to heighten the emotional impact of such scenes br br one of the greatest films of the silent era 'the battleship is a triumph of phenomenal film making and is a significant slice of cinematic history the highly exaggerated events of the film among other things there was never actually any violent massacre on the odessa steps have so completely themselves in the memory that we're often uncertain of the true history behind the depicted events this is a grand achievement
<START> tokyo eyes tells of a 17 year old japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop this lame flick is about 50 filler and 50 talk talk and more talk you'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus talk and play video games talk and get a haircut talk and walk and walk and talk talk on cell phones hang out and talk etc as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen the thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value a meager cast and no action no romance no sex or nudity no heavy drama just incessant c
<START> an interesting slasher film with multiple suspects br br includes typical girl flashing her breasts denise cheshire as she changes into her swimsuit creepy suspect any one of them could be doing the deed expected breast baring to get a passing grade linnea quigley a very unusual forward pass more bare breasts a track and field event that will not be in the summer olympics and a ghoulish secret br br it all comes to a crashing ending no there's more won't this guy die i bet anne patch mackenzie doesn't plan any more visits home anytime soon br br if you like teen slasher films can you possible be a pervert even if all the actresses are over 18
<START> let me say at the outset that i'm not a very artistic person and that i don't get new art that being said this film is absolutely crazy and in my opinion not crazy in a good way filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories is a film for those who can look at modern art and say wow i feel the energy and passion of this painting the only reason i give this film a 3 out of 10 is because i actually did manage to laugh at some parts though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn as to do what these characters were doing i have no idea i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody
<START> fellow giallo fanatics beware and or proceed with caution Â for this movie isn't exactly what it appears to be it surely looks like a giallo with its juicy vhs cover showing a busty naked girl and a big bloodied knife rhythmic title and the names of two veteran italian actors in the cast john phillip fernando rey but it's basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot the version i watched is presumably harshly censored Â with a running time of barely 77 minutes Â but then still there's a severe lack of suspense character development and most of all sadistic and typically giallo carnage eyes behind the wall can briefly be summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues it's an interesting effort notwithstanding because writer director giuliano his only film clearly attempted to do something special but the overall result is unsatisfying and regrettably tame inspired by hitchcock's rear window the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair bound writer he and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from spying on the single male tenant living across the road the tenant respectively likes to perform gym exercises around the house whilst being naked and clearly has bisexual desires wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex then there's also the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls are there any normal characters in the story well no of course not the film benefices from a continuously ominous atmosphere with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography but none of it ever leads anywhere so it's all just sleaze sex without significance there's a truly bizarre twist revelation at the end of the story but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality not recommended to fans of italian horror cult cinema but maybe it is great viewing for psychology students to analyze the characters freud style
<START> a couple of years before scream spoofed the slasher horror genre with savvy self conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation a little movie produced in russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions br br this movie was mute witness starring a cast of unknowns except an extremely brief cameo by sir alec guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie it told the story of a mute make up artist billie who is working on a film on location in russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend andy she is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence a chase ensues and finally she is rescued by andy who take her home as they alert the police the trouble is there is no body no evidence that anything of the sort took place even so a mysterious inspector seems to be on side of the story br br and to say more would be criminal mute witness is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller it's one that pays its dues to movies like wait until dark and the best of hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts deadpan humor americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless and nail biting suspense until it seems something must snap even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away very smart
<START> from the opening scenes of fierce people an interplay of tribal customs as photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator finn earl demonstrating why this south american tribe of is so fierce the direction of the film is nebulous are we watching a dark comedy about comparing life in the new york streets to uncivilized peoples or is this a message film of a more serious intent but as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear griffin dunne's direction of dirk wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times as it strays from rational plot development but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to patch up the holes he created br br our narrator finn earl anton yelchin lives with his coke addicted masseuse sexually obsessed mother liz diane lane in new york waiting for the summer when he is to join his anthropologist father on a field trip to south america a father he knows only from letters and videos when a drug bust abruptly changes their lives one of liz's wealthy clients ogden osborne donald sutherland rescues the down and out family and moves them to his ten acre estate the epitome of wealth and power in exchange for being private masseuse liz and finn can live in the mansion with the rich' daughter mrs langley elizabeth perkins and grandchildren chris evans and maya kristen stewart osborne and his physician lead liz on the drying out path and finn bonds with osborne and his grandchildren and despite the disparity in poor versus wealthy the living situation works for a while incidents occur to alter feelings and finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant a turning point for the film and view of the osborne family osborne reveals his past to finn and together they manage to discover the truth about troubling incident and also about the fierce disease of the wealthy class br br the film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes for this viewer that works well but when the director elects to place tribal individuals in full regalia within the context of the osborne estate the concept feel contrived as though the audience has to be forced to 'get it' the various subplots between maid paz de la and finn and the introduction of an obese retarded chalk artist whitney williams push the credibility edge of emphasizing the line between the wealthy and the but the performances by sutherland lane and yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the film's lapses not a great film but one with a lot of worthy ideas splashed around on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction grady harp
<START> wow i felt like i needed to shower off after watching this one but maybe there were other reasons that i will leave to your imagination i felt used and abused after i mean watching this film hairy chests thick mustaches and well hairy everything describes this porn horror movie but hey it was 1981 you can't call it porn in the 70s and 80s without the hair br br as a horror flick this bites but as a piece of exploitation porn from italy's rich cinematic history it definitely has a place in my library the copy i have is in italian with english subtitles i wish it had the really poorly dubbed english i think it would have added to the sleaziness factor that already existed the only white guy who gets laid in the movie is mark shannon he is the moustache wearing hairy chested piece of machismo who really does try and give a performance every time he steps up to bat this was at the end of an era where porn producers were actually trying to make something artistic nothing like panning the camera from a tropical backdrop to a hairy man having doggie style sex with a woman i can't help but laugh br br this is one of those movies that i pray my future wife and kids never find
