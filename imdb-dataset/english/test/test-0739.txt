<START> my favorite film this year great characters and plot and the direction and editing was smooth visually beautiful and interesting br br set in barcelona the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine the leading role would never have been cast in hollywood but he carried the part perfectly the characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate there were two especially noteworthy scenes the climax was truly inspired the film is sentimental and the last ten minutes could have been cut but it was wonderfully entertaining br br i nearly didn't watch it but did just to see audrey tautou her role although billed second or third was minor and was outshined by several other characters i wish more films like this were made it brought to mind the big chill or the breakfast club don't start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 1 2 way through
<START> a dedicated russian scientist dreams of going to mars he eventually gets there but it takes the whole film before we are able to have a laugh at the russian style of revolution in mars
<START> wasted is just that a waste of time mtv is churning out made for tv movies at quite a clip nowadays a friend of mine recommended this and i rented it needless to say i will not be pursuing anymore from her anytime soon this movie shows the rollercoaster of drug use the problem is you really don't care about any of the characters due to lack of and their own self discipline this movie is in a word annoying to watch from the terrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pacing the format tries for realism but comes up distracting if you want a true scope on drug use watch requiem for a dream
<START> heart of darkness movie review joseph conrad's heart of darkness is pretty dark deep and very profound i would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie the character mr kurtz played by john was totally the wrong actor to do the part he fit the character in of mice and men the movie left out man key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the story br br the movie is poorly edited it shows a lot of non important and annoying flashes in the novel it has a very suspenseful atmosphere but in the movie it lacks that kind of feeling in the book there is so much that was left to the imagination of the reader for example when marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie in the novel marlow waited very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat this was a big source of futility in the novel the movie added more parts that were useless and kind of didn't make sense for example when kurtz was talking to marlow at the end of the book and kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him that kind of just ruined everything didn't make any sense to me what so ever so my suggestion to you is don't view the movie just read the book you will understand more and have a better interpretation of the story br br chris c
<START> i had no idea what this movies was about it jumps from plot line to plot line erratically linking incoherent ideas with one another it simply doesn't make sense br br the chopped up time line doesn't help either we start in present day get a flash back to the past and then return to the future only to go back into the past br br this movie is also filled with horrible sappy lines and clichÃ© themes such as princess and the pauper you cant have me even in my death lines you don't even love me enough line clichÃ© to the max br br fighting scene were horribly corny lighting was constantly misplaced which offset the cg with the actors you could tell some of the backgrounds were clearly cg br br although the society in di moon was quite interesting br br i wouldn't really recommend his to anyone avoid if possible br br if you found this comment hard to follow the movie would be equally as bad
<START> ham handed homage to honest hacking felt good in a soft core way about equivalent to its mild pornography until its vapid lack of technical and economic reality emotional and moral sophistication became apparent br br basically a muddled '90s remake of real genius with fewer and stupider geniuses and a cynical bad ending br br perhaps this movie would appeal to someone delighted by the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy it's almost accidental or perhaps to technical types who like seeing themselves depicted as cool and sexy speculating about the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself the movies closing credits song is more interesting than the movie itself
<START> this horrible action Â sci fi movie is a crap i have just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies i have ever seen the story does not make any sense there are lots of flaws in the screenplay the characters are badly developed the unknown cast is horrible the lead ham actor seems to be too old for his role i was induced to buy this vhs which has a magnificent cover and see this crap due to the illogical imdb user rating and some ten stars reviews i have just checked the authors and each one of them has just one short review of l i n x issued in imdb and nothing else why are they promoting such a garbage my vote is one br br title brazil l i n x l i n x lethal connection
<START> the most stupid of seagal's movies i've ever seen the final scene is just crescendo of stupidity my recommendation if you really like steeve seagal's movies never never rent or buy this one do not repeat my mistake and keep a good impression of him which i've lost
<START> this movie was terrible you couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie it came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and i literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene it was one of the worst movies i have ever experienced worse than all dean cain films combined to start the acting was terrible i realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor but one would think that any tv experience would have given them a little more talent the movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality in the movies defense the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right
<START> nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to put him to death and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is an afterlife so they do and soon enough all of the medical students want to know if there is life after death the afterlife isn't about pearly gates and lights at the end of the tunnel but something more sinister br br past ghosts come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone it has some pretty scary moments that could translate into real life and it makes people wonder somewhat about what happens when you die it's a good movie to see when it's raining and you're feeling down it's also a little weird br br see it with a haunted past
<START> i still count police squad as the absolute funniest tv show of the 1980s somewhere on betamax no less i have all six episodes i knew that a show this good wouldn't last and that i had to preserve it for myself how stupid was abc they were quoted as saying that viewers didn't know that police squad was a comedy because it had no laugh track right when has a line like you take chances just getting up in the morning driving to work or sticking your face in a fan how can that be comedy i've seen every episode at least ten times and still see something new i missed before even the deep backgrounds always have gags ongoing don't miss it if you have chance to see an episode but if you're reading this then you probably already have copies away someplace as i do
<START> i've seen about a half dozen of the low budget poverty row b westerns that ken maynard made in the 1930s and i am consistently amazed at how poor an actor he was how did he ever get to be a leading cowboy actor they say that he could ride pretty well back in the silents but he doesn't do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films still maybe he got the leads because he was big and could ride br br phantom rancher isn't as bad as some of the other ken maynard films i've seen but it still isn't much some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a young fella where it appears to me that he's just as old as the other older actors br br and if that's not silly enough there's a rather significant script problem in this film at one point one of the characters makes a remark about how the phantom had prevented the poisoning of a well something that hadn't happened yet just a couple of minutes later we then see that particular scene no it wasn't a flashback at first i thought perhaps that when treeline films was doing the dvd transfer they might have reversed two of the reels but in those days film reels contained approximately 11 minutes of film and the whole reversal only took about 3 or 4 minutes tops everything else was in a logical order so it looks like that was a genuine continuity problem in the original film maybe that's one reason why colony pictures didn't last very long
<START> this is the second movie about 1985 the other one was 'the wedding whilst the was portraying the pop side of the 80's 'rock star' is all about metal br br mark wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and jennifer aniston plays his girlfriend when his fixation rewards him his whole life changes in a day br br the story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star sex and drugs are very limited in this movie but it is full of roll the music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly the whole concert feeling is very well captured since they used real audiences no cgi here br br great direction and a brilliant performance by marky mark who acts like a true metal dude br br 'rock star' is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene you are going to love this movie br br 10 10
<START> three young college women and pia go on an adventure canoing down the river dividing their slovenia from neighboring croatia in this 2002 slovenian film by maya weiss what could have been an eastern european version of the well known and exciting 1972 deliverance turned out for me to be utterly uninspiring with flat character portrayals that denied sympathetic identification with the characters br br and are not convincing as students at all though expresses a desire to be a writer and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language is bored with her boyfriend and seems to just be drifting along in life even less scholarly is a self absorbed adventure seeker with an attraction to other women i had some sympathy with relatively innocent conservative and starry eyed the very idea of these three traveling together just doesn't work for me the disdain that and show toward makes no sense why would they choose her as a travel companion to start with as surely they must know her demeanor and attitudes br br the three begin a carefree journey down the river on two canoes undeterred by a news story of a woman's disappearance along the river things become more somber with the mysterious appearance sometimes real and sometimes possibly hallucinatory of a rabidly conservative fisherman politician jonas br br i did enjoy the scenes along the river and of small villages the trio visit it may be because of a lack of cultural understanding but the film didn't move me otherwise i was surprised to see that the film has won some awards
<START> i saw the korean version of daisy first it came across as a simple love story that flowed nicely from start to finish i saw it 3 times as i waited for my copy of the director's cut to arrive br br then i got the dc and watched it wow i think this is the first real director's cut i've ever seen amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions the dc is laid out like a hardcore thriller with the love story in the background it moves at a slower pace than the korean version the variations between both versions are so drastic it seems like two totally different movies i thought i would be worn out watching the movie again it out just to look for the added scenes that wasn't the case it really felt like i was watching a whole new movie br br while the dc is 20 minutes longer than the korean version you'll be hard pressed to pinpoint where or what has been changed 2 seconds chopped off here a second added there an entire scene added here another erased there in both versions scenes have been added omitted or chopped up and in some scenes entire lines of dialogue were replaced or while the scene itself was untouched even simple sound effects were added omitted from each version having a major impact on the mood of the film and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene what comes across as a tender moment in the korean version is a sad somber one in the dc the endings of both versions leave room for interpretation as far as i can tell both versions end a lot different and were intended that way br br i'm assuming most people will be acquiring the director's cut of the film and will find the movie pretty decent but a little long and boring if that's the case look for the korean version same movie but different feel i think there's a deluxe 3 dvd version that contains both cuts of the film not sure br br the versions compliment each other so well that as a pair i'll watch daisy more often than i do any of my other favorite korean movies alone i'd say the korean version is a nice love story that i'd watch once in awhile the director's cut i'll watch maybe once or twice then never again as i find the pacing dull but they just go so well together for what i consider the best experience i'd say watch the korean version first then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gaps of the story that you were curious about br br the editing is the real star of the film
