<START> another movie with a star of a wrestling so far i have noticed wrestlers can't act on the movie screen this movie is no exception br br the action is dreadful it makes you laugh at what they say and they can't be serious they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid the acting is horrible possibly from the bad director br br the plot was stupid just some people get placed in a hotel because they're criminals and they get randomly killed off the movie is stupid all the way through making it one of the worst i have ever seen br br the only think and this is why i give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way jacob goodnight dies the pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesome br br overall this is a really horrible movie and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it
<START> the foreigner is a straight to video steven seagal film that was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in march 2003 an intention which was reportedly reversed when seagal's prior film half past dead tanked at the box office according to some reports the film had a lavish 20 million budget including location shoots in warsaw and paris and was completed as part of the studio's obligation to a two picture deal which was negotiated after the relative success of exit wounds seemed to indicate that seagal still had a solid following br br despite the size of their investment sony screen gems probably made the right move in shelving this movie it is nearly incomprehensible what am i saying it is incomprehensible i don't think i understood what was going on at all except in the very broadest terms br br seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy other mysterious guys try to stop him other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him other really really mysterious guys do especially mysterious stuff all of which which was in fact too mysterious for me to figure out the intended mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband because he is a self proclaimed consummate professional who has been hired to deliver the package only into the hands of the husband seagal at first defies the wife then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained agendas as well as from her husband br br many people have mysterious cryptic conversations many people blow each other's brains out some guys seem to die more than once while in other scenes gunfights end without a clear view of the result so the audience sees somebody die but is not sure which one of the gunslingers is headed to boot hill allegiances shift often adding further mystery or should i say confusion br br i don't know who was on whose side or what anybody really wanted and the resolution was as unsatisfying as the exposition at the end of the movie i just sat there thinking that's the end what the br br i couldn't even figure out the credits imdb says that aussie actress kate fischer from sirens was in this film but i'll be damned if i know where either she was left on the cutting room floor or she wisely opted out of the project she could have found some activities more beneficial to her career like having unnecessary surgery ripping those pesky insert cards out of magazines or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry br br seagal used to be a pretty fair hand to hand combatant but the action scenes didn't manage to redeem this film at all seagal is in his 50's now and is a very large man so he is reduced to a level of physical exertion and even during that he is contained in a knee length coat to hide his brandoesque girth he might even get a little winded removing the from candy bars although that's understandable if you estimate just how many of those he must have to eat to maintain his present girth br br steven seagal seemed to be making a comeback with exit wounds but if his last film was half past dead this one must be pretty close to filling out the other half
<START> if you decide to watch wild rebels don't expect anything deep and meaningful if you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang wild rebels is the wrong movie if you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the american educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency wild rebels is the wrong movie if you're looking for a movie that examines how rural police departments are when facing a well financed well organized gang wild rebels is the wrong movie but if you're looking for an absurd movie filled with scene after scene of unintentional humor horrendous acting a paper thin plot and community theater style production values wild rebels is the right movie br br wild rebels is the story of a down on his luck stock car driver named rod tillman steve after a fiery crash which rod walks away from completely unscathed despite having only a cotton pants and a london fog style jacket for protection rod decides to give it up with no plan for his future other than to wander aimless through the back roads of the south he stumbles on the satan's angels motorcycle gang a gang being three of the stupidest guys to ever zip up a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share this group of hoodlums spends their time terrorizing a rural town in florida by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox these bumbling idiots need someone to act as their driver during some larger crimes they have planned apparently these three einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires not four so they recruit rod to perform feats of daring that only an experienced stunt driver would be capable of like keeping the car in the middle of a gravel road during a low speed chase eventually they hold up a bank get into the aforementioned low speed chase and have the lamest gun battle with the police ever put on film i could go on forever but you get the idea br br i hate the term so bad it's good but that seems to aptly describe wild rebels
<START> eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in 1985 to totally abysmal now it's such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings br br the ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat the first two out regardless of their sex will sleep with each other the 3rd 4th out will have a fight in the vic the 5th one will be arrested the 6th develop an addiction 7th get pregnant etc etc br br the producers are clever though the 30 minute show is only actually ever comprised of 3 lines br br 1 someone will walk in the vic say what's on 2 someone else will stand up say leave it out 3 then a woman will say doan choo come in ere 'n' insult mah br br that's it that's every show apart from the occasional get it sort id is it sort id br br the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk their way of life the came off when 1 they extended it from two nights a week 2 the slater family turned up how they attract viewers is beyond me the kat character symbolizes everything that's gone wrong with society treating anyone else like something she's pulled off the bottom of her shoe br br the people who vote her the best character in these polls must the same as the ones that vote jamie 'best despite the fact he hasn't played a game for 3 years br br what i can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of british tv why do all the biggest names leave ross martin the list is endless br br how long has the longest couple's marriage lasted with them being faithful to each other yes people leave but until the script writers realise that characters couple can be interesting likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate an episode last week had 3 separate plots of exactly that and zoe the doctor top even lofty as 'most unconvincing couple ever to appear on tv ' br br yes eastenders is the most watched show thats undisputed but many external factors contribute to that 19 30 20 00 is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures it has an omnibus edition for 2 hours and more than that millions of the viewers watch it out of nothing more than habit but if they were completely honest to themselves they would admit that in 2002 more than ever it can be absolutely pitiful
<START> firetrap is yet again another bad action film about a guy who yada yada yada and happy endings and fire and burning and overacting and bad suspense and predictable and just don't see br br dean cain got stuck playing superman on lois and clark and can't get any good roles anymore so i don't know if he is a good or bad actor br br this isn't good br br why can't anybody stop that bad people who keep making these things ai swear they just s them out on a conveyor belt and hope they are good they need to make a guy whose job is to just burn the movies that look bad just have a bucket of next to him and dump the cases in then at the end of each day light it and go home
<START> every time i see a film like this i get sick to my stomach when i watch a movie i like to see what i see in everyday life as i go through my day i see blacks whites asians latinos etc how do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you i'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention i don't care if it takes place in kansas or south central all i saw was one token black this was typical in the 80's hey it's 2007 with all the rappers singers and athletes working as actors thomas haden church could have paid more attention to his cast aren't actors supposed to be more liberal
<START> blame it on rio is a romantic comedy 80's style with more than an eye full of sex throughout its 101 minute running time br br the plot concerns two middle aged men in crisis one of whom is sorting through his divorce the other dealing with the possibility of that same prospect both good friends they decide to take a vacation in exotic rio de janeiro each with a daughter at their side complications set in when one of them gets involved with the other's daughter br br this potential riot of a story is fairly funny and there are some good lines however it never really becomes hilarious as it could have any attempt at handling the moral issue seriously doesn't work either and perhaps director donen should have stuck to the humour of the situation br br not a bad film but what really ruins it is michelle johnson's awful performance as the naughty little temptress jennifer while she uses her body to full advantage it's the only thing she's got michelle's acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired no wonder we haven't seen her in anything else br br friday january 7 1994 video
<START> well well i had seen a lot of reviews on this one and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene but this flick is a tough one and i mean it by all ways it's hard to find a copy because it was a low budget independent release and because mpaa was on the hunt for every copy on vhs it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the mpaa so copies disappeared into the underground scene all people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz so it made this flick unique vhs copies almost never pop up on ebay or other sites and if they do you will pay over a 100 to get one but due us connections i was able to catch a release on dvd sold worldwide limited but it was to be a sort of official one now and then there are still some screenings of this splatterfest but is it worth all the hype surrounding it as said earlier it is a tough one to catch but also to sit through there are gory killings there is necrophilia there is nudity but there is also a lot of talking between the coppers and to be honest if you would like to see the movie in 5 minutes watch the ending it's a flashback in the killer's mind the blood flows and indeed it's a splatterfest but not the full 80 minutes splatter galore for 10 minutes the quality of the movie is okay sound okay no hiss colors okay black is black and not blue as in many low budgets it's okay to watch it but you never will be frightened but it's one to watch with your friends having a beer and a pizza i guess 555
<START> i saw the mogul video vhs of this that's another one of those old 1980s distributors whose catalog i wish i had br br this movie was pretty poor though retitled don't look in the attic the main admonition that is repeated in this is don't go to the villa just getting on the grounds of the villa is a bad idea a character doesn't go into the attic until an hour into the movie and actually should have done it earlier because of what is learned there br br the movie starts in italy in the 1950s two men are fighting and a woman is telling them the villa is making them do it one man kills the other then regrets it and the woman pulls out the knife and stabs him with it she flees the villa and after she's left a chair moves by itself what's the point of that but when in the garden a hand comes up through the ground and drags he into the earth br br from there it's the present day thirty years later there's a sÃ©ance that appears suddenly and doesn't appear to have anything to do with the movie the children of the woman from the prologue are inheriting the house the main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother at least one of the two men from the prologue seems to as another character too she's haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa but they all do since if they do not use it they forfeit it people die a lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little the ending is pretty poor why was the family cursed an unfortunately boring movie br br there's an amusing small print disclaimer on the back of the video box that reads the scenes depicted on this packaging may be an artist's impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film in this case the cover of the box is an illustration that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene although there are two hands and the woman is different it's true sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie i also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale in which movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos got at least one point for that
<START> the movie starts off as we see a footage of a huge drought back in the 30's in america then a short story is shown about a creepy looking farmer elija who made a deal with satan to get good harvest elija hired young men to work in his garden killed them and used as scarecrows he also fed the ground with their blood some time after 2 cops come to visit him one of them gets shot by elija another one kills the farmer himself after that the present day is shown and some guy named sean is told that he has an old farm left as inheritance he decides to go there with some friends to see what's up little did sean know that the next night is the payback night br br as for me this movie had a good story for a horror flick but low budget and poor special effects just ruined it dark harvest is a perfect example of lazy film making for example we see a scarecrow a usual guy wearing a funny cheap mask chasing a girl when he raises his hand we get to see a normal human skin below his glove instead of some rotting flesh the gore is not very impressive as well there are some nasty killings by our lovely scarecrows but everything is very cheap and unrealistic surprisingly the acting is somewhat ok in this flick or i better say its believable some nude scenes are presented as well for the fans even a lesbian scene but those scenes don't save it br br verdict good music good story solid acting but awful effects cheap gore and plot holes slow this movie down not really recommended
<START> the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable the comedic timing written into the script is more than enough to make up for a well worn underdog plot when you're sure you know the ending surprise highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular great movie
<START> this film almost gave me a nervous breakdown when i was recovering from a few years ago i had just started teaching in secondary high school the whole teaching business was all a bit for a beginner but to mentally prepare myself for going back into the classroom i decided to watch some rather awful films the flintstones was one of the films that i chose and then i put king of the streets the uk title of on just before it finished i found myself almost in tears at the sheer waste of it all my life the film stock the Â£2 i had paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the blockbuster ex rental section the time it must have taken to print the sleeve art the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack as as their efforts were the list goes on br br i love bad films let me make this perfectly clear i love watching crappy films from blockbusters me and my mate dan used to sit and watch many many cheapjack horrors and laugh at them but this was a different type of crappy film i don't think that anything has come close to this not even tobe hooper's death trap which is probably my second worst film in the world the whole making a car from abandoned parts section nearly killed me the repetition of music at any available opportunity regardless of on screen events the whole i can't even carry on with this dissection as my gag reflex has started the futility of that film even now three years after i watched it for the first and last time still renders me speechless but i am still able to type the whole making a car from odd parts section had me contemplating horrible things br br i implore you if you are interested in watching this film just gaze at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story synopsis on the back i can almost guarantee that it won't be even half as bad as this film actually is don't under any circumstances contemplate actually watching it for any reason whatsoever not if you are a christian and you want to see a christ allegory not if you are a bad movie and you want to experience the true nadir of trash not even if you want your life to seem longer and believe me every second that this film runs seems like at least a minute make no mistake about it this film is unholy it is the antichrist in video form as bo in get shorty said i've seen better film on teeth
<START> pink flamingos is a cult classic the plot of this film revolves around the challenge to supremacy as the filthiest person alive pink flamingos contains some memorably repulsive scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where divine eats fresh dog feces yes the movie is shocking and funny at the same time but the biggest laughs come from the actors' lines check out especially this line from divine kill everyone now condone first degree murder advocate cannibalism eat s filth is my politics filth is my life on the whole i really enjoyed this film still its tagline an exercise in bad taste should be taken to heart and even those used to the gross out movies today may find this gem hard to stomach highly recommended
<START> when i first saw before night falls javier bardem had just been nominated for an academy award i thought he's got it he didn't i watched mar last night please give it to him this time this is an actor convincing touching emotional brilliant see also los lunes al sol and you will understand what i am talking about he is an absolute chameleon and i swear it's not only the result of make up work this movie is so beautiful so well done the characters are so real congratulations to alejandro amenÃ¡bar how about a best director nomination i also have to mention the make up artists i can't think of another word but magnificent i really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves as far as i am concerned it already has
<START> this is simply another bad chuck norris movie norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women he put the guy away three years before but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house he's in by using what looks like dental floss then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation irish jack o'halloran is the best thing in this movie but like in superman ii he doesn't say a word somehow that's supposed to make him more menacing ron o'neal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the city's mayor and norris' sidekick respectively the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock it's so 1980's when coupling norris' serious acting turn with over the top musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion the film becomes a chore to sit through the build up while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way it's yet another disappointment from cannon films and it plays like a movie made for television of 4 stars
