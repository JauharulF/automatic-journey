<START> running out of time is probably as close to a perfect film as you're ever likely to see out of hong kong all the elements click a terrific script by french writers julien carbon and laurent that even manages to subvert the odd clichÃ© reliably imaginative direction by johnnie to and excellent central performances by andy lau and lau ching wan the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior's abysmal negotiating skills the supporting cast is fine too with yo yo mung making a strong impression in a tiny role and even the often histrionic lee looking remarkably and very aptly like a bald andy lau it in to good effect it's best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set up Â with only a few weeks to live lau engages in a criminal game with wan's cop with no easily apparent motive Â and just sit back and enjoy the ride it's certainly worth the fare it also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies and played in a mere three scenes the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of film making i've seen in ages there's also a fine score by raymond wong as well the most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years
<START> in the twilight years of his career charles bronson forged long running with several directors most notably j lee thompson and michael winner he did two films for one time bond director peter hunt too the first being the decent 1981 actioner death hunt the second being this indifferent political chase thriller assassination is pretty dull if truth be known and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace like the conspiracy for instance which plotwise this film resembles br br bronson sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard jay killian whose assignment is to protect the american president's wife lara royce craig jill ireland real life wife of bronson killian believes that mrs craig has been targetted by assassins she thinks he's an over protective paranoid pessimist turns out surprise surprise that killian was right all along and someone is indeed out to eradicate her the pair of them go on the run pursued by the assassins br br everyone knows that the wife of an american president is known as the first lady for some reason in this film they have renamed her one mama quite what the point of this is is anybody's guess but it's indicative of the film's pointlessness as a whole most of the film's performances are lazy and the script takes a heck of a long time to get to where it's going if i had to label assassination within a specific genre i'd say it is supposed to be a thriller i'd say that with some reservations however as to say that it's a thriller it has precious few thrills
<START> after sitting through the trainwreck that was the first dark harvest movie i couldn't leave bad enough alone upon seeing that there was a sequel or rather what i believed to be a sequel i had to increase my pain level seeing that this had nothing to do with dark harvest that should have been a good thing we didn't get any killer scarecrows in this one instead we got a jackass walking around a cornfield screaming out little things like girls and can you hear me every so often plus we got two four if you include the two girls that the director wanted the same effect as the twins in the shining obnoxious little girls who couldn't act and the cherry on top of this mess would have to be the corn cop i should have known this movie was going to be terrible when the dog got an opening credit how i managed to stay awake through this movie i'll never know
<START> a friend of mine once rented this thinking since peter fonda starred in it it couldn't be bad wrong it's bad as anything can be there is so much to laugh at and it's not the jokes for instance in one scene walks into the forest and when he comes out he is suddenly wearing a completely different outfit where was the director's brain when he shot that scene probably the same place fonda's was when he agreed to do this flick it's truly a shame one has to see such a fine actor go dumb in this poor excuse for a film br br nobody's performance in this movie can be called acting jack elam is brought in just to bring up the star count here but all he does is looking startled in a very dark and awfully shot scene in some kind of bar not to mention the indians the girl was so godawful i wanted to shoot her just to end her misery and mine as well if i could give this a 0 i would shame that mark doesn't exist here this truly reminds of a bad joke or an amateur footage made just for fun this should serve as a proof of how bad b movies can get
<START> i can't quite explain why i find this so alluring and the leopard not it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film those intimate moments that visconti can render so magnificently like that film it has a majestically slow pace but this time it isn't overlong it's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that i think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini story like the leopard it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos though performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable especially in look he has a really stupid grin that's easy to dislike it's often quite beautiful in the quiet moments it's the opulence of visconti's films the grandeur of the ball scenes that i find tedious as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision but here that is part of the point gustav surrounded by a visual din br br the way in which the object of affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant the camera shows a girl girl girl then this beautiful feminine featured boy it's like an allusion to shakespeare's and it doesn't feel heavy handed it's not until the camera views fully pulls back and we see his long slender legs that we realize he is not a boy but an adolescent at first we're forced to question attraction in an uncomfortable way visconti must have known that and he doesn't shy away from it visconti is extremely patient with gustav we get a sense of the man we know him it's a largely silent performance and when he does open his mouth it's to spew venom no wonder he wants the angelic open featured boy to project himself onto there's a difference with we never know him just as we never know a handful of fellini grotesques but that's because his life is another its own film but it's not as flirtatious as it's been made to seem there is one scene however where he twirls around a pole that's too much isn't necessarily leading him on he's looking at him visconti just zooms in is all br br the film doesn't detail gustav as being gay isn't even really male he's a version of a boy delicate pale wispy with golden locks that everyone seems to love including one gorgeous slightly older young man who he wrestles with the closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to homosexuality is the famous barber scene which unlocks his repressed vanity br br it isn't totally successful the whole section with alfred is a waste and some unnecessary scenes people carrying bags in long shot could have been excised some parts are heavy handed such as when boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by the looks on his face are too obvious but during the same scene gustav throws a fit wanting a new something so unexplainable that it makes up for it but there are some scenes touching for the first time that build up a remarkable quiet intensity repeating a piano song again and again the notes quivering in the air may be the best example of the anxiety the film has there is one discussion that contains a debate i'm especially interested can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses or does it have to go beyond them we can consider tarkovsky who both visconti and mann to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations i think this one manages to do both 9 10
<START> seeing this film brought back to me memories of 9 11 the first thing i remember of that morning was seeing tv pictures of an airplane flying into a large building and my immediate thoughts must be a preview for a new tom clancy film br br this was not a tom clancy film this was certainly not a british version of the sum of all fears the typical tom clancy film or novel has a relatively small cast a linear plot and usually some sort of resolution this film had neither sure what i saw directly on screen was a small cast a plot and a vague resolution but like 9 11 the point was that reality was so much larger and more complex br br i work in systems planning and the reality of the disaster preparation exercise and the disaster itself is painfully obvious it's impossible to prepare for a disaster like this nor will it be any more possible to deal with this when it happens br br from the argument between the police not enough is being done to prepare and the politicians giving everybody on the tube a would cause panic to the constant loudspeaker announcements you are in no danger to your health but don't go home before we you and don't eat drink or smoke before we you i was on edge during the entire film not the slightest urge to channel surf br br this film was 90 minutes in length it could have been twice that and still not shown all the possible details instead it left enough unsaid to allow each of us to imagine the details each of us in our own way that made it so much more real to me than any tom clancy film br br i lived in london once and just off the road and i took the train from waterloo station many times as i watched dirty war i kept telling myself that this is only fiction right now br br allah and jehovah willing this film will remain fiction and sometime in 20 or 30 years my nephews may watch this film and remember the early 21st century and the panic we felt too much hopefully to the same degree as i feel currently when viewing memorabilia of the cold war with the evil communist regime of the mid 20th century and remember drop and cover exercises in school
<START> as an adventure mini series this is about as good as it gets i viewed it when it was originally shown on hbo sigrid is totally believable in her role as philadelphia and the whole production was first rate see all 400 minutes of it if you can i highly recommend this mini series amazing that i can't rate it officially but for you readers users i will let you know it's a solid 10
<START> let me start out with saying i was very surprised with the production value of this movie i managed to catch an early showing and i have to say this is the best if not only christian film to hit theaters since the passion br br don't let the pg 13 rating scare you off the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film divorce teen pregnancy drug use and suicide but nothing in the film is gratuitous this is definitely a movie that a junior high youth group could see without upsetting most parents and the message is wonderful the best part is this is not a film for christians it is a family film without the cheesy 7th heaven feel br br the laughs are there and several times in the theater everyone was laughing the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced and that made for good pacing in such a serious film teens and young adult both religious and otherwise will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film and i was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film the plot is not in any way predictable and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit christians fortunately are not shown as all mighty know it all's of the word but instead people just trying to understand life humans make mistakes and no one is perfect not even in this film not by a long shot br br the acting is top notch the writing spot on and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy christian rhetoric this is a great film that will make you and your teens think talk and perhaps question their own morality or lack thereof if you want to see a quality family film in january check your local listings for this film and you might learn something about yourself br br and i am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie
<START> before i took a job as a reviewer i never went to films like this and thus remained blissfully unaware that at the soul of the hollywood film lies a deeply woman hating spirit that thrives on putting its knocking little knees on the silver screen for all to either empathize with or revile or is this just a particularly bad year an ugly trend br br here we have yet another seemingly sweet innocent beautiful woman turned lethal weapon the kind that cautions us that beneath every pair of batting eyes and nesting instincts lies a wild eyed beast guaranteed to make everyone's life within 50 miles a living hell br br this month's specimen is jewel valentine's liv tyler whose simple dreams include having her own little house a backyard fountain and a mondo home entertainment system unfortunately randy matt dillon in his first film in 3 years the dim bulb bartender she picks up at one night intending to rob is less materially oriented the kind of guy who drinks beer out of a toilet he prefers to down in his dead mother's house with few creature comforts save his collection br br in that same low rent bar the devil in the red dress also bumps into randy's cousin carl the highly amusing paul reiser a lawyer with an ego the size of st louis when things go south within hours enter the widowed detective with a heart of gold john goodman the result three men sustain big bad crushes on the leopard clad progeny of steven tyler and bebe crushes that make them do things that common sense would normally like get involved in the first place br br multiple points of view and flashbacks patch together the front page news about how easy it is to fall victim to one's libido especially if you're male as each of these men relates his perspective to a confidant his desire to possess the jewel colors the truth' of the situation about 70 minutes later things come together in a reasonably amusing way but it's amusement from the same source that tells you that the stuff on the popcorn actually tastes like butter br br is the first film by norwegian commercial and music video director harald and his pedigree is clear during some of the fantasy segments including one about a car wash soap and a hose that you can probably it's also the debut project from the production company owned by michael douglas who's found his niche as a in a bingo parlor br br dillon and tyler are unlikely to win any gold statues for this one though given the one dimensionality of their overdone film noir type characters you can't really fault them several minor roles drag out unexpected guests reba mcentire plays carl's psychiatrist and andrew dice clay doubles as both the hoodlum utah and his even scarier brother finally an outlet for all that aggression br br this film unwittingly speaks volumes about the dynamics between men and women or men and their mommies but ultimately you'd probably find more lasting psychological truths in a bugs bunny episode i will say that it's better funnier more sophisticated than other recent gems like but should we really have to choose what to see based on what ranks lowest on the scale
<START> having spent the six years previous writing and producing luc returns to the directors chair with angel a i'm a huge fan of and quite liked the prospect of a black and white french film from the same chap br br andrÃ© is a liar and gambling addict owing money to almost every loan shark in paris unable to repay his debts and fed up with being held over the edge of the eiffel tower he decides to kill himself he happens to do so at the same time as a mysterious woman who he decides to save determined to thank him she begins to help him fix his own life br br the film starts with some laughs which run well throughout the visuals are quite nice and work well with the sights of paris but that is it that's all the film has got going for it and these mere two facets can do nothing to hold back the torrent of terrible film making the movie unleashes though i can't hugely fault the main character his inconsistencies are close though the eponymous one is ghastly a terrible screen presence and bitterly annoying the plot is ridiculously inconsistent itself and at times bizarrely silly particularly the ending an ending which completely bloodied the fledgling redemption engendered by the scenes immediately prior to it perhaps the most ridiculous scene i've had the ignominy of observing it is stupid indulgent melodramatic and considerably too awful to be so bad it's funny the overall premise of the film could conceivably have once held potential but it is brutally massacred by the terrible implementation of its ideas the film really was a task to watch and one which had me screaming at the screen the whole way through br br massively and immeasurably flawed angel a is just plain bad though its occasionally fun dialogue manages to draw out chortles at rare intervals by the end it is clear that this film is nothing more than repugnant
<START> at the end of my review of cache i wrote that i was intrigued with haneke as a film maker this is what led me to get the dvd for la pianiste which i just finished watching about a half hour ago br br it's all been expressed here at imdb and in many of the external reviews the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create' an individual like huppert's erika who is still trying after years and years to please her mother at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life beginning with her self she's repressed everything that would free her from her self imposed bondage including of course her sexuality which has literally imploded to the point of madness to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like br br this is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult i think this subject relates to all of us we're all striving for autonomy but there are needs so many conflicting needs most of which are not even on the conscious level it also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about sexually and the reality of those fantasies as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film and it is hardly the experience she had imagined it to be br br regarding the much discussed scene in the bathroom i really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge for the viewer i mean sucked out of it because of the prior scene where she put the glass in the girl's pocket by the time she's acting out her let's see if this guy is worthy scenario in the bathroom we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe br br i think another incredible achievement of this movie is how about halfway through it i completely forgot that it was not in english and that i was reading sub titles that has never happened before in any foreign movie and i've seen quite a few br br in this film like cache the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow but unlike cache we do at least get some sense of finality despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether huppert's character is alive or dead after experiencing la pianiste when it comes to michael haneke i am needless to say more than a trifle intrigued
<START> the great dictator is arguably one of charlie chaplin's most widely known films it is notorious for it's blatant satire of adolf hitler and nazism until watching it i only knew of it's fame now i know how much the film deserves it br br the film basically shows the exploits of the somewhat clumsy ambitious short fused and impressive dictator of and with him his near and dear staff field marshall herring and herr also it entails the exploits of an amnesiac emotional and often clumsy jewish barber a veteran of the first world war br br stopping with the plot i would like to say that this film has various qualities that make it both unique and wonderful while the comedy is decidedly both verbal and slapstick and incidental the entirety of the film shows how serious it takes nazism or aggressive nationalism as a theme with various interludes chaplin's impeccable acting skills range far and wide in the film he keeps it up and up until he simply explodes position as an ambitious jewish would be and henry delivery of a nasal calm as death serious as a heart attack lines makes for wonderful viewing br br further one aspect of the film is what makes it so special it pulls no punches it isn't covert it has no business being covert it is an overt blatant in your face obvious lampooning of both hitler and nazism br br to sum up briefly watch it just watch it you'll see it
<START> this movie i've seen many times i read the book which was written by who received the scandinavian book awards for the work the movie does not start on the same place as the book starts it happens in and the main character is young and having a good life with his girlfriend but as she breaks up the relationship with him he starts to get some headaches which make him annoyed and angry and soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie begins soon he is in the icelandic mental hospital called and there you get to see some great characters like viktor who thinks he is hitler and who thinks that he writes all the the beatles songs and sends them to them with mind transporting e who has the role of the main character does is so work so well that it leaves you breathless also the music in this movie is mad by and just for the music's cost you should see the movie overall a great movie meant to be seen
<START> i agree with the comments regarding the downward spin the last view shows have been a little better but surely the writers need some more direction i think the characters are still interesting although sometimes they spin into the white trash things a little too much subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like office i would think the target audience is somewhat similar being they are both on the same night and lineup one would think that karma and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows but they only scratch the surface of the subject in my opinion it shows the contempt that many people have in hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses we can handle more heady content it has been proved before in many other shows
<START> an incredible performance this is one of the best films i have seen ever i know this is being said a lot but i bet you will not regret watching this film br br it's great from the very beginning to the last second the acting of especially the mother played by judith light is so convincing there are not many other films i've seen that could compare to it and it seems it's impossible not to feel anything for the people in this drama br br there are lots and lots of movies made every year but if you have to choose just to see a few in your life make this one of them
