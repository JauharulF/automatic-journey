<START> some describe as the most controversial film of its era while this is debatable it is certainly one of the most embarrassing virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it author gore vidal actually sued with mixed results to have his name removed from the film and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence what they wanted of course was for it to go away br br for a while it looked like it might caligula was a major box office and critical flop producer had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all and although the film was released on vhs to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re edited and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade but now is on dvd available in both edited r and original unrated versions and no doubt john gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen br br the only way to describe is to say it is something like deep throat meets david lynch's dune by way of fellini having an off day vidal's script fell into the hands of penthouse publisher bob who used vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars and then threw out most of vidal's script and brought in soft porn director brass then when felt brass' work wasn't explicit enough he and giancarlo lui photographed hardcore material on the sly br br viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination there is a tremendous amount of nudity and that remains in the edited version but the original comes complete with xxx scenes there is very explicit gay lesbian and straight sex kinky sex and a grand orgy complete with dancing roman guards thrown in for good measure the film is also incredibly violent and bloody with rape torture and mutilation the order of the day in one particularly disturbing scene a man is slowly stabbed to death a woman urinates on his corpse and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs br br in a documentary that accompanies the dvd release states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan rome if so he missed the mark we know very little about caligula and what little we know is questionable at best that aside orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of roman society where adultery was an offense punishable by death and certainly ancient rome never looked like the strange slightly oriental oddly space age sets and costumes offered by the designers br br on the plus side those sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice the score is also very very good the most successful member of the cast is helen mirren who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the empress gielgud and o'toole also escape in reasonably good form the same cannot be said for mcdowell but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with br br the movie does possess a dark fascination but ultimately it is an oddity more interesting for its design and flat out weirdness than for content some of the bodies on display including mcdowell's and mirren's are extremely beautiful and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography but then again some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstinence and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism if you're up to it it is worth seeing once but once is likely to be enough br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> i feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film it is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake or perhaps their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart looking for any reason at all to dislike them br br the long kiss goodnight is an action film in every sense of the word sure there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself i have never been a big geena davis fan but i was impressed with how she was able to create two very different characters samantha cain and charlie baltimore in my opinion it wasn't even necessary to have changed her physical appearance to differentiate between the two her acting was more than enough to do the trick br br more than anything else though this film was craig in another's hands the character of timothy could've been just another interchangeable villain his decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the right counterpoint to all of the action scenes it isn't often that you find an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expressions point in case the scene in the freezer with charlie and her daughter where most films would've cluttered the moment of revelation with unnecessary dialogue eyes told the whole story br br the basic plot thin to be truthful a seemingly average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she had been an assassin as her memory returns so do the people who want the assassin dead is she really samantha the cookie baking housewife or charlie the cold blooded assassin or maybe a little bit of both for me the long kiss goodnight was an enjoyable journey to find out
<START> when pam grier made coffy in 1973 it was an exciting though flawed film the plot was gritty and satisfying even if the acting was often amateurish it was so successful that american international pictures decided to rehash the formula the following year with foxy brown not a bad film but certainly almost like coffy ii now only a year later the studio had apparently given up on creating anything new for ms grier as sheba baby was essentially the same plot from coffy and foxy brown yet again because the idea was so recycled and because the acting and acting are so tired and low energy it's really scraping the bottom of the blaxploitation barrel br br exactly like these other films sheba baby begins with some local black mobsters pressuring and eventually killing someone pam grier loves in the past it had been drug dealers and pimps now it was mobsters trying to run all the loan companies and pawn shops out of town so they can corner the market and like the other films pam is a one woman hit squad dispensing justice and a good butt and like the other films there is a cat fight between pam and a white lady right in front of mr big and like the other films mr big is a white guy pulling all the strings and like the other films she is captured by mr big and like the other films he doesn't immediately kill her but gives her ample opportunity to escape here leaving a knife conveniently lying around and like the other films she eventually gets free and kills his jive br br while this formula did seem interesting in 1973 by this film it was frankly a predictable bore even if you hadn't seen the other films it still was bad because the action was so slow the punching and kicking seemed so slow and staged the same could be said for the gun play in one scene four guys with machine guns an ar 15 and shotguns attack pam responds by opening fire with a 357 revolver and killing 3 of the 4 and getting the other to surrender even if she's a good shot she was rather slow and the guys just seemed to wait until she killed them plus even a world champion shooter or rambo couldn't have succeeded with such one sided odds after all these guys had very impressive weapons and they were already pointed at her when she cleverly whipped out her pistol and easily dispatched these professional hit men br br in addition to slow and lame action scenes compared to any other film the movie has many logical gaps that show the writing was terrible but the studio just didn't care in one case her boyfriend williams knew about the yacht and nu at the end of the film but pam never told him how did he know about this in another the cops approach a boat filled with hoods and the hood immediately open fire however the cops had no evidence anything was happening and the crooks began firing with little provocation and the crooks had 30 caliber machine guns and other amazingly powerful weapons but in many cases were killed by cops wielding snub nosed br br the bottom line is that this is a great example of been there done that a whole lot better i love blaxploitation films but this one is just too dopey and slow to merit watching except by very devoted fans of the genre
<START> terrible acting terrible script wholly unrealistic the bumblebee flies anyway exemplifies the cliches and sentimentalism that movie studios love to cram down viewers' throats elijah wood is unimaginably bad in the primary role and the plot points are contrived and sappy cook's and wood's relationship is laughable at best but the worst element of bumblebee is the script this is some of the most mind numbingly bad dialogue i have ever had the misfortune to hear actually crawling inside my ears and stinging my eardrums would be preferable to hearing elijah wood robotically spit out his pseudo profound lines i wish a bumblebee project would be performed on me so i could mercifully have no memories of this stinker
<START> imagine the worst thing that could ever possibly be conceived by human intellect now imagine something infinitely darker i mean worse than that then multiply that by the quantity of the suckiness possessed by the star wars holiday special this movie is by far worse than that br br dracula 3000 infinite darkness starring such illustrious and reputable actors such as coolio and langley as the film's horrifying antagonist count is to eating one's own feces exclusively for one's entire life condensed into approximately one hour and twenty minutes to be frank there is no way to approach a review of this cinematic tragedy riddled with communist propaganda promotion of drug use futuristic anachronisms and quite possibly the worst special effects since the original war of the worlds br br the hammer and the sickle of the soviet union can be seen proudly displayed throughout the dingy sets they dare call a spaceship lenin can be observed on several posters throughout the film and of course religion has been abolished for two centuries by then so they don't know who this god is even though they have no reservations about using his name in vain but of course in the socialist republic of space presided over by interstellar president baker death stick like drugs are legalized and quite common yet handicap mobility seems even worse off than it is today they don't even have a wheelchair ramp br br racial tension still festers throughout the galaxy in quite a familiar predictable fashion we receive great commentary on ethnic division through lines such as is dracula a us gotta stick together and once you go black you don't go back speaking of the token black characters one is played by coolio playing a stereotypical stoner coolio becomes possibly the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever oh wait second most ridiculous vampire ever that prized title goes to our friend count from planet transylvania in the carpathian system these two make quite a pair between coolio's attempts to cripple a strange attempts at making high pitched animal noises a hairstyle years old and gigantic stretches of completely worthless dialogue and count twenty dollar generic halloween style vampire costume exploding coffins or confusingly inane back story br br one wonders if they did not simply give coolio the opportunity to get as high as a kite in space without gravity let him interact with the other actors and just went from there br br count motivations are also somewhat in question does he want infinite darkness as the film's subtitle would have you believe does he want to eat the crew or does he want coolio to kill them all or does he desire to give handicapped people a chance in such an future it doesn't really matter because none of this film's plot makes sense anyways br br the highlight of this movie has to be it's ending more for the fact that it means the movie is over than by any merit of the abrupt trainwreck of a climax they phone in before the credits instead of facing count off in some sort of duel the closest we get is a shot of flailing around at breakneck speeds in front of our protagonist who dies shortly afterwards our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in an ordinary door then proceeds to collapse screeching in pain at a totally mundane yet understandably painful injury this is by far the most fun you'll get from this movie watching a vampire's contorted face as he cries in pain will have you on the edge of your seat with laughter almost worth the four bucks for that alone of course right after that we're treated with one of the film's worst one liners the mandatory allusion to sex and perhaps the most abrupt excuse for an ending ever they're driving into the sun and their ship literally just blows up before they even come remotely close to impact i think they just outdid the wachowski bros for the worst finale ever br br i can only sleep at night because we know that a sequel is impossible secure in this fact we can safely say that this is the worst movie ever created and one which will never be exceeded in low quality lower budget and lower est acting talent
<START> this movie is definitely a case of style over substance but the style is good and certainly more than unique on its own to make the cell a memorable and above average movie br br the cell is beautifully looking with impressive sets costumes and make up yes it's real eye candy to watch all the movie has some perfectly sequences that are certainly odd but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at this movie is a perfect mix of an art house type of movie and a typical hollywood thriller that is accessible to both fans of the genre br br the story itself is pretty far fetched and doesn't always make sense because of that the movie isn't always pleasant and likable to watch but like i mentioned before the style compensates for this the style makes you keep watching till the end and provides the best moments of the movie br br vincent d'onofrio is unforgettable as the serial killer with a twisted mind vincent d'onofrio is really underused as an actor and this movie shows his talent once more i'm not particularly happy about the casting of jennifer lopez i know that she can act in some of her movies but she really wasn't suitable to play the main character in this movie her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by vincent d'onofrio and vince vaughn still i felt that vince vaughn was also miscast in this movie he didn't fit the role well enough and no i'm not saying that because i'm used of seeing him only in comedies now days the rest of the supporting cast is good and still give the movie a certain degree of credibility br br the musical score by howard shore was also surprising good and was sort of se7en like at times it suited the movie well and gave some of the scene's some extra mood and atmosphere br br it's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far fetched and not always handled in the right way still the cell is a perfectly watchable movie and perhaps even a bit of a must see due to its style originality and creativity br br 7 10
<START> who really wants to see that disgusting violence disgusting sex for such a long time i do not want to but i always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be this was the hardest right after next friday br br it's basically just crap how can you possibly call it anything else the story of a roman emperor as an excuse for gore and t a yeah yeah hey it's realistic they have been like this fine but why bother us with it i don't care if it has been like this and there are a lot of scenes where i truly doubt it the point is why should anyone wanna see it problem is there is only one reason you could like the film and that would be that you like violence there's nothing special about it just cruelty you can say cool as you'd say in splatter slasher movie but horror movies with violence at least can give you chills and excitement maybe characters you care about but here everything is dark dull and boring every character is mad the story of an emperor who can't deal with his power what in the very first scene he runs naked through the woods with his sister i have no problem saying that we saw a madman for 2 1 2 hours br br but maybe you get turned on by seeing helen mirren being pregnant and dancing or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie or castration yeah right that was fun real birth scenes how hilarious humans animals who cares let's just treat them as toys br br i don't care what anyone says this is no movie this is just 2 1 2 hours of blood and sex degrading and disgusting go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror flick if you want violence at least those movies don't pretend to be some artistic masterpiece and they are shorter br br 0 10 6 1 6 0 4
<START> before this was shown on mtv or vh1 it was at my local theatre playing just before the main movie i remember this short movie more than the film i saw that day it was the first time i had ever a music movie like this but i will tell you that seeing on the big screen from a 35mm print in a darken theatre gives it a much better impact than seeing a cropped pan and scan version on vh1 at halloween
<START> i really really don't understand how that movie could get a rating bigger than 4 here on imdb it's simply a huge mess and i have to admit that i actually liked 1 close to no story okay i can live with that but at least they got to the point pretty much at once 2 does not after the stupid premise has been presented there is well over half an hour of stupid and unfitting teenager clichÃ©s dumb as hell dialog and close to nothing else except for a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse to have that first half of the movie and predator scenes that make you ask yourself whether those guys making the film even watched any other predator movie or just didn't care enough to be bothered br br after that that crap fest finally gets to the point where the predator starts attacking the aliens or at least pretends doing so and boy is that predator stupid blind and deaf it's awful how he even managed to earn that stuff he has is beyond me he misses with almost every shot only notices aliens when they're right in his face or if it's absolutely necessary for the script so that he can move where he has to be he even gets caught on surprise by puny human teenagers and deputies all of the time what's that guy supposed to be after the first hour of that abomination i was more or less constantly shaking my head at every scene close to no scene in this movie passes by without unbelievably stupid dialogs stupid predator actions or stupid lack there of or stupid actions from our heroes br br then that thing finally ended to my surprise not only me and my friends didn't know whether to laugh or to cry but everybody i overheard leaving the room was half crying half laughing about those 1 1 2 hours they just wasted br br don't watch never
<START> back in the day i was one of the in the emergency rooms these skaters would occasionally land in they were not treated well and some of it was brought on by their personalities but we all knew they were a talented bunch of even then they deserved better care than they received i'm afraid they had attitude in spades br br i'm so glad i caught this documentary on ifc tonight it will be on again at 1 am and i'll be watching again br br little attention was given to them until the rich dying kid was able to talk his parents into draining the pool and the film really highlights that as the taking off point it was an amazing time and deserved to be recorded stacy peralta is due all the praise heaped on him and long may those z boys enjoy their memories and contribution to the real sport of skateboarding as for the few sour grape reviews contained herein there always were and there always will be wannabees and hangers on who never do more than dream the z boys lived it breathed it were it br br nice to see the vintage films and even the lone girl peggy who was so talked about as being the only female to win their respect br br thanks to ifc i get to really take the occasional drug free head trip of my youth and relive the heart pounding excitement again
<START> i went to see this because i'd never seen tel aviv where the story is set i was disappointed since it doesn't offer many views of israel's largest metropolis it's also of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders br br the main protagonist is a woman in her twenties' who works as a waitress at catered weddings her parents evidently don't care about her very much and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an ring around her feels compelled to take care of her the little girl doesn't speak and can't give her to social services because it's the weekend and the agency is closed so she takes her back to her apartment with the leaky roof and when it comes time to work in the evening she has to take the little girl with her the boss is very unhappy about this and other shortcomings in work performance br br another main character is keren who is getting married at her wedding party where is of course working she breaks her leg climbing out of a ladies' room cubicle whose door won't open and so she and her new husband cannot take the caribbean vacation they've planned they end up in a dingy hotel on the seafront without a view it smells bad there is noise from the traffic and keren is complaining all the time her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman Â a writer Â who is also staying in the hotel and keren worries that he has slept with this stranger br br the third main character is a filipino woman named joy who looks after old people the old woman she is hired to care for is very crabby and speaks no english only german and hebrew joy speaks english but no hebrew or german joy is mostly concerned with how her son is doing back in the philippines and wants to buy him a toy boat as he has asked she finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it the daughter of the old woman who hired joy is an actress appearing in some sort of post modern physical theater adaptation of hamlet and does not get along with her mother br br the way in which these three intersect themselves is presumably supposed to mean something profound i didn't get it there is a fantasy element to relationship with the little girl and maybe non existent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in this relationship when joy sees the toy boat in the shop window there is a strange effect used where the little sails as if blown by the wind and they do this as if they are on the scale of a real life ship keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room and a narration of the strange woman's poetry mentions a ship in a bottle but what does all this mean i thought about it for a while and realized i wasn't going to lose any sleep in the process if anyone out there has a clear idea of what it's all about maybe they can fill me in
<START> there's a unique place in the pantheon of john ford films for sergeant rutledge and the sun shines bright it was these three films with no box office names in them that ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it john wayne henry fonda or any of the others he worked with not surprising that ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another br br ben johnson and harry carey jr a couple of likable sign on to guide a mormon wagon train to a valley in arizona territory along the way they are joined first by a group stranded players from a medicine show and then by a family of outlaws on the run named clegg their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the film's plot br br had been done even 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances turned in by johnson and carey both probably would have had substantial careers as b picture cowboys in the case of johnson it would have been art imitating life johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to hollywood with a string of horses for john ford to use in fort apache ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history br br but the day of the b western was drawing to a close and johnson and carey had great careers as two fine character actors br br ward bond plays elder leader of the mormons bond is a recent convert though and has trouble remembering to not use some four letter words but he's the leader because of his strength of character not his impeccable lds theology he turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader br br in portraying the ford only had to reach back four years to his my darling clementine they are the reincarnation of the gang and pure evil in fact if walter brennan who after my darling clementine refused to ever work for ford again was willing i could easily see him being cast as shiloh clegg the head of the family as it was charles kemper did a fine job this is probably the role he's most noted for shortly after this film was done kemper was killed in automobile crash he might very well have worked for ford in the future br br ford makes the mormons pacifists here and i don't recall that pacifism was part of lds doctrine nevertheless it works here the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are innocents when dealing with evil people like the it takes some gun toting cowboys to properly dispose of them i think that this post world war ii film is trying to say that pacifism isn't always the best policy br br another from my darling clementine is alan mowbray playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe part of that troupe is joanne dru who's doing another turn as a woman of elastic virtue the same as she did in red river dru used to do so many westerns that she longed to be out of and into some modern fashions br br is great entertainment and i'm willing to wager in the state of utah it's a pretty popular film
<START> this is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so i won't repeat the same compliments but faith akin being an turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary european falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall but come on man you are turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond old town it's a missed opportunity for that reason performances by and are peek of the movie and a very talented and bad ass turkish rapper makes some trash talk about american gangsta rappers which i totally agree i will recommend this movie to my american friends
<START> as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate apparently not so much space for opinions in between i for one think that is a good sign br br i always appreciated this movie although the genre is not my typical style i never watched titanic for instance and am not planning to br br the english patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are 'home' katherine it shows how destructive love can be in a slow strong and utterly painful way it excites because of the extremely passionate affair the pain of the one s who leave behind how pointless one can feel to move on br br the photography is just stunning not to mention the play of the actors the pace is slow but timely and that does justice to the book the timeline and the depth development of the characters to put this in 110 minutes as some seem to suggest here would amputate the multi of this movie people tend to have difficulties with the pace of movies as if they are in a rush to get to work hey get a life enjoy br br i give this movie 4 5 out of 5
<START> wait till you watch this one i mean even after reading this review no other movie till date has sucked more than this one one thing i wont understand is that when you are ripping off some english flick why to add your own creativity with the amount spent for making this movie the producers should have considered buying rights for cellular to be dubbed into hindi and released the movie they might have gotten some profits that way i guess if there was a chance to rate this movie with a 0 i would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from tanushree datta and the girl who played the sidekick to i don't know if my problem is that i have seen cellular much earlier than this movie but that cant be a reason to support this movie i could go on for hours but neither i have the time to discuss about this useless crap of a movie not i want to remember those awful scenes from the movie br br please stay away from this flick
