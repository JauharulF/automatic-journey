<START> while watching a mundane modern movie the runaway bride with my granddaughter age 22 she asked me since you've been watching movies since 1938 what is the greatest movie of your lifetime boy what a choice that is it took me all summer of thought and a some flicks before i made my decision it is the best years of our lives this movie has no flaws it is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story there is not a single part in the film which could be left out the young girl's fixation with her brothers lack of hands the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas the portrayal of a young man whose only was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men and was awarded medals for his action a women who must now adjust to the husband who's life has been away from her for years the realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf the look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands a parents first look and reaction to their son's new deformities a man used to making life and death decision in a instant having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank's loan structure this is no sympathetic tear jerking heart strumming act this was real life it could not have been portrayed any different this my friends is how it was this could easily be considered a documentary in this day of color film please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest b w filming editing and directing you will ever see the casting was perfect if i could i would make it compulsory for anyone taking history film making creative writing sociology family or psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers art
<START> how could this get a 6 0 rating are we as horror fans so used to horror films being so utterly bad these days that when one comes along that has some and i repeat 'only redeeming quality's we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a wee bit too high the director has a certain visual flair no doubt about that but in between some decent shots he forgot a good story mood or scares it had a very slow first act lazy killing scene's annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist and what's with the portrayal of american teenagers in so many of these kinds of films do they always have to be this stupid irritating and so mn superficial i don't remember teens being like this when i grew up here in holland all things considered in can't give this film anything more that a 4 out of 10 rating
<START> my wife and kids is a good and funny series that truly shows the worries and problems that happen the most even in the best families br br michael kyle daddy is a man who is always trying to stop his children from doing teen's stuff like partying drinking loving or making love when they do something wrong he is right there to correct them by the way he loves to make bad penalties br br janet kyle mother has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband she understands that their children are teenagers and like to do wrong things unlike michael does br br michael kyle is a dumb guy who believes in everything other people say in the beginning of the series he's such a cool guy and tries to be like his father but lately i don't know why he becomes a very very dumb dude and he starts being a problematic guy in the end of the series he falls in love with vanessa and becomes a father or should i say a dumb father who does nothing right br br kady kyle is a typical teenagers who loves to party kiss and drink she has many problems with her parents because they invade her privacy too much she has a boyfriend called tony who is catholic and is scared of everything so we can't understand what makes she date him i can remember one episode that they're prepared to have sex but michael kyle scares tony claiming that sex is very dangerous and deadly so he decides to guard himself until he's married br br i resume this is the best series of my life and i still watch it everyday after 3 years so i recommend to all of you mostly for teenagers
<START> okay so the movie went straight to video if i had paid to see this i would've been disappointed but at 2 am in the morning alone at night it's a pretty good fright hey that rhymes br br
<START> film historians have said much about ancient epics that have been the interest of many directors from the beginning of cinema the pioneers of such epics particularly biblical ones were d w griffith with his mother of all epics intolerance 1916 and cecil b demille with his flair for magnificent spectacles costumes and lavish scenes who can forget his ten commandments 1923 1956 or the sign of the cross 1932 nevertheless here comes another epic made in the 1950s directed by michael curtiz and based on the novel by the egyptian michael curtiz already famous for his great classic casablanca 1941 wonderfully manages to adjust his film to the audiences of that time to entail the most important ideas and facts from the thick novel and to recreate the lifestyle of the egyptians who lived in one of the most amazing periods in the reign of br br the first and most important fact for me in this movie is the psychological development of the main character that edmund purdom plays having been brought up in a simple family by his step parents becomes a physician all his life he never stops asking a question why and searching for the answer alluring love that he finds in a courtesan bella leads him to financial and spiritual disaster he has to repair the mistakes by hard work in the house of death and starting to build up his reputation from nothing first he thinks that the only cure is revenge however in the long run he realizes that eye for eye is no solution finally what stands before him in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a pharaoh nevertheless there is one moment he finds the answer for his questions that touched him throughout his life the story of the main character though based on the book is so interesting psychologically that every open minded person should consider this aspect in the film the main character's psychological struggle is intensified by the times he lived in the times when probably for the first time to that extend the power of sword with the power of thought br br curtiz's movie also retains one rule that all films of his era kept to great cast and lavish sets there are mostly british actors and actresses who give very nice performances how is it possible not to mention the mainstay of ancient epic victor mature this time he is not hannibal or samson but a fighter a lover at last a pharaoh jean simmons appears in a very delicate role of merit a woman who loved all her life but it was too late when he realized that peter ustinov probably most famous for his gorgeous performance as nero in quo vadis three years earlier does a great job as friend the royalty of the film is also played by two great cast gene tierney and michael wilding tierney is excellent as cold desirous of power the sister of pharaoh wilding gives a marvelous performance as insane when i was in louvre in paris and saw original face carved in stone he looked very much the same as the actor in the film bella an actress born in poland is quite memorable as a wicked courtesan and there is one more actress who appears only in one scene but whom it is hard to forget judith evelyn as pharaoh's mother this voice these eyes br br the sets are magnificent the director recreated the most probable image of the outdoor temple of the god that the egyptians worshiped to in the reign of iv i also loved the scene of pharaoh's first entrance what a glorious picture that forever lasts in one's memory however there is also one aspect that i would like to draw the attention of all people interested to see the film the egyptian is similar to other epics in many respects but it also stands out as a unique film there are very few films which make such a wonderful use of different as for ancient times there is a mention of iron used first by the it's also the only film about ancient egypt which talks openly of magnificent curing abilities it memorably shows the contrasts of lifestyles particularly the moment of a slave's death for whom no one cares followed by the announcement and consequently the widespread mourning after the death of pharaoh finally the egyptian shows one historical fact there were other nations except for jews before christ where the spirit of god shone in some human hearts yet the only difference was that it did not survive that long as at jews' because it did not have a strong the scene of death supplies you with so many biblical and christian values that you may think you watch a religious movie br br all things considered i highly recommend michael curtiz' film it is a great production at multiple levels an entertainment for epic fans an admiration of marvelous performances for cinema fans a soul feast for spiritual people finally it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things which happened thirteen centuries before the birth of jesus christ
<START> i saw this only because my 10 yr old was bored he and his friend hated it but of course liked being at the movies this is the first time i've strongly disagreed with ebert in many years there is not a single thing to recommend this film willis is good as always but the story stinks is unbelievable there is no real story no action no interesting cinematic sequences no surprises and worst of all the child star is a thoroughly repulsive slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a dweeby fat slob for a kid by all means stay away and spare your child unless you want to punish him or her there is no excuse for such lousy directing or writing and one hopes these filmmakers will suffer accordingly
<START> this tough to see little picture played at the mods rockers 2007 festival it is a wonderful and loving look at harry nilsson using many famous faces who sit for interviews rarely seen tv performances and behind the scenes footage of nilsson at work there's even a few shots from son of dracula this movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music it's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and or performed his friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hulk with a subconscious wish for self destruction as a bonus you even get eric idle performing the song with wrote for final album during the closing credits it's funny it's sad it's not in general release if this picture plays anywhere near where you live see it
<START> first of all the title daily is a lie br br every daily show program opens with an on screen visual of the date it was made followed by a pause and the opening announce on the many days when they are re running a daily show they slip cue the tape and omit the date and begin with the opening announce giving the false impression that the show is a new one that's a lie there is no mention of it being a rebroadcast and that kind of crap is just a small indicator of how sneaky and deceptive this show is br br furthermore it's only on 4 nights a week that's not quite daily meaning monday through friday another shortcoming but one i am grateful for br br it's sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main often only news source this leaves them woefully ignorant and much worse badly br br although it leans liberal left politically this show can be amusing at times however its veracity is low facts and information are often cleverly twisted to fit the writers' agendas it's often hard to tell where the facts leave off and the fiction and comedy writing begin the result is pre digested information designed to persuade and influence this is called propaganda br br the remote interviews are heavily in editing br br it really loses me when it bashes god and christians which it does all too often however you'll never hear anything vaguely anti semitic br br if jon stewart and company attacked anyone but christians it would be considered an offensive outrage the names in the credits explain the source
<START> let us assume for a moment that you haven't experimented with the mushroom and you're wondering about the so called bad experience and just how something like that might play itself outÂ well go ahead and pop in a fresh copy of the beguiled see with film you have your clean trips solaris and anything else directed by andrei tarkovsky whack trips i e the experience from which you never recover sweet movie and el topo and you're bad organic trips a category specifically reserved for a film like the beguiled which is the sort of content those keen writers at the times who made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the harvard department of english refer to as hallucinogenic in tone by the third act of this don siegel directed movie you may not exactly observe that your two lead heavy hands have become shrunken and assume all the characteristics of a burrowing mammal nor will you exactly fall under the suspicion that your spine has achieved the same sinuous shape and texture of a fruit baring tree incalculable in age but you will feel something br br in 1970 when this film was filmed most americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective pain a movie like the graduate perhaps a lot of world was going on and of course you had the nightmare break down of war in vietnam what you get with the beguiled banal drug metaphors aside is a screenplay adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as and direction from the director who helped bring about the work and career of sam peckinpah in the beguiled donny siegel born in 12 chicago il less than 45 years after the great fire is showing his attempt at grappling with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970's in the form of a classical film artifact the beguiled is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect the shooting editing direction and story are all fantastic and you're not likely to see anything else like it undoubtedly a sinister film its effects as i've said both dizzying and frankly it's hard to believe would ever universal attached its name to this picture but you are going to see upon viewing some of the sweet sweet camera moves and cinematographer bruce surtees exploiting every bit of dark myth you harbor in your head about the american plantation south beauty with evil in every location shot clint eastwood needless to say has never been like this old clint he moves at instant from coy to his eyes like two spirals in medium close up the rest of the cast is equally exacting and uncanny br br this beguiled will never make the afi 100 in my lifetime but that doesn't stop me from that it's one of the best american synch sound films ever made while most people catalogue it as a western to include the folks at the western channel the beguiled is a problem because you don't really know what it is a sort of war movie a drama psychological thriller maybe the answer to all those emotionally wrought noir films starring kirk douglas i actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man who likes to kick back with the cheap gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like the wire saw that high angle medium long shot of geraldine page wrapping a around clint's bloody leg pa was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the outback bowl right before he absconded to another room my advice watch this one and make sure it is on a very large screen preferably run on that home theater projector you're contemplating i would put the beguiled right on order along with that important consumer purchase turn the out throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall and try not to lose your grip because just like norman bates we all go a little mad sometimes even the beguiled
<START> series as a whole jim henson's best work john hurt is the storyteller often oscar caliber screenplays not surprising when you consider doing the writing oscar caliber acting always br br everybody loves 'the soldier and death ' but something about pushes it an iota higher in my favor in the first ballroom scene the costumes the music perfection hurt and the dog typically semi interact with the story but this time pushes it up that extra notch in the 'ring' scene between hurt and the chemistry between characters is especially well developed more so than usual in the series in reference to the friendship between and the prince seen it see it again pay more attention to those of you who don't fanatically adore this 22 minute piece of cinematic perfection never seen it i am so so sorry br br luck child not as sophisticated as but very clever in its own right this is a story about irony irony upon irony within irony i love it every character is acted to perfection with the exception of the ferryman he was doing drama everyone else was doing romantic comedy i forgive him this is my favorite of the primarily comedic episodes and 'the soldier and death' being examples of more dramatic episodes br br side note greek myths what it lack in subtlety different writer it partially makes up for in boldness as it portrays the four chosen myths with more sympathy and respect and history than is usual also check out the jim henson hour if you can get your hands on it for storyteller it features the man himself introducing the myths the lion from 'true bride ' and no annoying opening theme half storyteller half pure unadulterated muppet wit
<START> this movie caught me by surprise for years i have avoided many of harold lloyd's sound pictures as well as those of keaton because they have a generally well deserved reputation for being lousy compared to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost however when i saw this film i was pleasantly surprised to find i actually liked it once i accepted it really was not a harold lloyd film despite him starring in it this is because although it is nothing like the style of his earlier films it is highly original and lloyd isn't bad playing a totally different type of character br br as i mentioned above the formula of the old films is almost completely missing here lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances and the plot is just plain weird instead of the usual roles he is the son of a chinese missionary who returns to america for the first time since he was a small boy because of this though he looks like an american except for his white suit and helmet he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is chinese in many ways he's very naive about america and is like an innocent among wolves early on he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss this boss always produces a losing candidate for the mayoral race because he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a token candidate who has no chance of winning well the old geezer who they traditionally run for office just died and he decides to run the naive lloyd he hasn't a prayer of winning well the unthinkable happens and lloyd wins this and lloyd's decision to clean up the town greatly upsets the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy honest lloyd just when it appears lloyd is headed to jail on a trumped up corruption charge he creates a scheme that is 100 impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from the crooks however despite this it is incredibly funny and a great ending so my advice is at the end just suspend disbelief and enjoy br br an important note this movie is definitely not politically correct the word chink is used repeatedly i found it offensive but considering the times i ignored it as you should too if however you are someone who can't and like being angry i suggest you never watch movies anyway as you are bound to become offended again and again
<START> i really liked this picture because it realistically dealt with two people in love and one of them having a disorder though the ending saddened me i know that that was the best way for it to finish off i would this to everyone
<START> very well done acting and directing this is a cross between the last don and godfather 2 one large plus for this production is that it is claimed to be a true story of joseph with a better music score to create mood it could have been a rival for both godfather movies
<START> despite its ultra low budget sorte nula is the most successful portuguese film of 2004 and i must say a well deserved success what i love about sorte nula the most is the intricate detail that fernando fragata went to keep you interested as to what is going on and just what will happen next it's very detailed and superbly advanced for a seemingly simple love story gone bad thriller what's even more enjoyable and ironic about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation not one of them knows the entire story and are left to their own assumptions making sorte nula a cut above the rest this is definitely not a film you want to walk out on for a bathroom break as you will undoubtedly miss something important i feel one of the film's major attributes would have to be the environment that it establishes it's creepy but hilarious at the same time i read somewhere someone quoting this film by saying it's was like watching hitchcock and i couldn't agree more i love movies like that where you have to pay attention to everything in order to fully understand what is going on 9 10
<START> i had long wanted to watch this romantic drama with a wwii setting and now that i have all i can say is that it's a veritable masterpiece of russian cinema br br soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but thankfully this one's free of such emphasis with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which he'll never return the girl a remarkable performance from is also loved by the young man's cousin and when she doesn't receive word from her boyfriend gives in to the latter and marries him he however is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and knowing too that the girl's still devoted to the soldier begins to neglect her finally word reaches the girl of her loved one's death but by the end of the film she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of him br br the film features some truly amazing camera work which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and by frequently adopting tracking tilted and high or low angle shots renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama individual sequences are equally impressive two in particular the stunning scene frenetically edited and sped up to boot in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck and the young man's premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front undoubtedly one of the best of its kind i've ever watched with the sun moving away from him symbolizing the life that's seeping out of his body as he imagines the wedding day he'll never have also notable however is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that's been hopelessly devastated during an air raid as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains br br disappointingly the r1 dvd of this outstanding film is a bare bones affair the ruscico edition features a few supplements but being an export tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot criterion released it in conjunction with another war themed russian classic ballad of a soldier 1959 which my pal at the local dvd rental outlet has told me is forthcoming br br the only other film i've watched from this director is the arctic epic the red tent 1969 albeit via the much shorter u s release version a star studded international production based on true events given the unmistakable artistic quality of the cranes are flying i regret missing out now on his famous documentary i am cuba 1964 a number of times when i was in hollywood late last year apart from receiving a one week theatrical run it was shown more than once on tv accompanied by a feature length making of
