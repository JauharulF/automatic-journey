<START> i was so offended by this film that i had to write something about it so please humour me br br its only redeeming virtue outside of some good acting is that it doesn't go on past 107 minutes even that length is about 30 minutes too long br br comparisons have been made here to the brilliantly dark 'the grifters ' but i can't see it they are two different films altogether the closest comes to an existing film is 'the sting ' made in 1973 it borrows sorry steals liberally from this splendid george roy hill ' which is exactly what is was i enjoyed it because it didn't pretend to be anything else br br there are so many red herrings in that i thought i was in a fish tank it's very confusing but that's only one of its many problems the principal one is this if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else where everyone is conning we have no to ground us the inevitable result is a mish mash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicks br br just about everyone in this film is conniving and objectionable surely a basic film 101 class would tell us that the audience has to 'care' for someone we can't 'care' for anyone here they're all it might have worked as a rakish comedy but it plays it straight from beginning to end br br if you want to see this film read no further big 'spoiler' coming sorry but i have to do it br br there's so much fake blood and so many fake killings that it doesn't strain credulity it destroys it the ending is absolutely ridiculous a 'murder' in a crowded airport that isn't really a 'murder' at all and the 'murdered' guy blood soaked simply stands up brushes himself off and walks away fake blood dripping with the booty all while the police and hordes of people are looking on and no one intercedes the director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks we're supposed to buy into this noirish b movies from the 1940s did better br br i'm a great fan of european flicks but this confirms that schlock doesn't always come from hollywood as far as is concerned my judgment lies with a famous line from the oft producer samuel goldwyn who knew all about schlock me out'
<START> jean hugh anglade is excellent as the teenaged boy who wants to be a whore to please the man he loves but the rest of this film is so bad acting writing cinematography and everything else that performance is wasted sad to see so fine an actor in such a garbage flick
<START> this truly is an australia cult classic if you're one of the lucky ones to have seen it then you are very lucky it has been released in most countries but not in australia for some reason i have a copy on dvd from the uk not a great transfer but i bought it having seen it previously at a film festival the directing is spot on and the performances rock this is dark film scary film but often times very funny in parts i urge you to see this film there is a coolness about this you don't see in 99 of the typical aussie fare the screenplay is very well crafted and sends you on a journey where you know it will end badly but until the last ten minutes you just can't pick how badly great work from the four leads especially lachy hulme br br when its all said and done great work on display
<START> i have just watched this movie for the first time today and just loved it br br yes it is simple in it's storyline the sweetest love story and how any female could not fall in love with callum blue beats me br br the scenery in italy was as you would expect beautiful the baddies lost in the end and for the two lovebirds to be reunited at the end was wonderful but that scene where a certain italian was sweeping away the confetti after eric and wanda's wedding perfection br br have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie yes better have a tissue ready and be enthralled i know i was and hope to get it on dvd real soon all the actors played their parts perfectly this was a ww2 film you could believe in as it was so realistic and without going over the top as in other films
<START> i was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week he told me it was so bad that i had to see it so i went on an auction site and bought the film this is probably the worst film i have ever seen it makes you laugh when it really shouldn't terrible acting and terrible storyline plus he looks nothing like michael jackson br br i still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see van peebles is a joke in this film br br robots cant bluff psyche br br i have to say though the special effects are actually amazing psyche dvds were probably even out when this film came out but if i had my way it would be a straight to vhs release yes people it is that bad
<START> i have never fallen asleep whilst watching a movie before br br i did with this one br br avoid at all costs give your time and money to a worthy cause instead
<START> let me start by saying that liev has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut everything is illuminated anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with nonsensical and hilarious vocabulary by alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy dreamlike sequences liev took all of this and made it work the movie itself is great the soundtrack the performances the cinematography it all works there is a lot of story missing about the town and its inhabitants but there's only so much you can do with an indie so this part of it didn't bother me too much it's just disappointing that not a lot of people will see this movie or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it i didn't even know it was in theatres i didn't know when the dvd came out you'd think that since frodo baggins was one of the main characters somebody wouldve at least released a commercial for it i had to see the trailer on my paradise now dvd released on dvd in the spring of '06 to even know that it had a fall of 2005 theatrical release date haha sad really br br anyhow if you stumble across this review somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and are recommending that you see it take my advice and watch it it's a very good experience br br 8 out of 10
<START> giant robot was the most popular japanese tv serial ever seen on indian tv it was targeted to children and we saw a robot for the first time in our life br br many indian children must have even seen a machine for the first time outside the school textbooks br br the serial also showed a child in an adults organization fighting evil no doubt many of us who have seen giant robot in our childhood long for our own robots and as a arrangement look upon our computers in the same way br br this show also portrayed ideal adults referring at jerry johnny's buddy friend and unicorn chief azuma we grew to respect japanese progress and still view japan as the ideal asian nation br br btw at that time there were no satellite tv channels in india and the govt owned broadcaster did not show much of disney cartoons i guess that was how child serials like giant robot got appreciated nowadays there is pokemon etc but they are no so fascinating or alluring as giant robot
<START> the premise of this movie is the guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think yeah this is funny cute and a good movie what the hell what is funny about immature girls fornicating with a married man with a new baby what is cute about the fact that he is cheating on his wife what have been wrong with them finding some teenage boys to have sex with before starting college noooo that is not good enough the guy has to be married off limits off the market that's the one we gotta have dumb ass girls then one of the girls decides that she loves the guy no she just loves the way he makes her feel two of the girls are having fun with it they think it is funny and no one seems to have any moral problems with what they are doing it just shameless but yeah this is all good with everyone one this website the dark haired girl even has the audacity to have her dad pick her up from the guys house under the ruse of baby sitting this is a morally disgusting movie and where is the wife poor woman working and paying the bills while he screws the baby sitter
<START> i still remember when frog baseball first aired on mtv in some sort of odd surreal manner the cartoon captured the stupid actions that i think every boy growing up in america engages in i cringe now thinking about how i burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass but it was interesting at the time for some reason growing up in the 1980s we all knew stoners these were the kids who wore iron maiden t shirts to school grew their hair long had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two we laughed at them because they were so stupid even when not stoned so it was easy to understand beavis co because we already knew them some of us were even them to the extent that like myself would spurn the excess of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s beavis co were sort of a strange post modern anthem for us strange because like beavis co we didn't care if we had an anthem it was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even if it was awful
<START> being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary i was eager to see how the subject matter was handled unfortunately the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history this film only concerns itself with the period within new york city ignoring the rest of the country while i spent a fair amount of time in nyc at that time i can assure you that there was a gay life outside manhattan the men interviewed here are the same a list queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the 70s and here they are again waxing nostalgic and still throwing attitude the film should have at least tried to cover larger topics such as race the burgeoning gay caste system based on wealth body image and the rise of the clones discrimination of sub groups within the community and the ability to grow a decent mustache which was very important in the 70s alas we have none of this presented and the recollections of those interviewed are no different than my own memories if you were there in that decade you'll enjoy the archival photos and grainy home movies of the bars and discos we haunted if you weren't there this film will undoubtedly seem dull it should have been so much more but sadly it's not two stars for jogging my memory i still miss going to the anvil
<START> sigh what can i say br br why does a horrible script such as this gets approved in the first place its not wrong to have a complicated plot but its not explained to the audience properly br br to have the wife explain the plot via flashbacks is bad bad bad to have such a tight editing for the fight scenes is bad too such fanciful editing only appears in trailers it cheapens the whole look br br and who are the russian guys at the top of the movie who is the guy being tortured is he with the cia br br this film deserved not to be released in theatre but it doesn't deserve to be produced in the first place its a joke to hollywood
<START> wish it would be released as i would love to see the finished product we saw the unfinished version before it came out loved all the characters and actors anyone know if it is out on video yet would love to see it again definitely worth renting if it's not going to be shown in the theatre i had a hard time finding it because they renamed it
<START> why is it better because it's true to the dark vision of the comic because the imagery is inventive and unlike the first there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one the first one had too much of jack nicholson's shtick too much prince music and an awkward romance here instead of one villain there are three no robert wuhl and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face in fact pfeiffer is the 1 attraction of this film her transformation is what drives the running theme teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity good and evil she becomes truly fearsome the costumes and makeup are excellent danny devito's penguin is inspired and anguished not just a nut his circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief besides that giant duck max shrek is the only character i'd have toned down walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman danny elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual and the siouxie and the banshees song face to face is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack the least campy of the films it is macabre doesn't pander and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride bravo tim burton and cast
<START> this is absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen i hope the real family and other portrayed characters have lawyers suing the hell out of vh1 for there portrayal the acting is horrible the writing is worse and the portrayal of characters is scary its supposed to be a drama but it was a comedy to me you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting i usually like flex alexanders acting but this time he has completely missed the mark br br you could argue he took this role for a couple of laughs himself because it was so horrible if you really want a dramatic movie for the night do not choose this one but if you are in for some laughs over bad acting and stupid writing tune in other than that don't waste your time
