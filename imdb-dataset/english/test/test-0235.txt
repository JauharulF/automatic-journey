<START> this one man show may be the most fantastic show i've ever seen to call this simply a stand up act is to do it a great injustice there is a definate reason that this was a broadway show john leguizamo is a master of making people of every culture feel at home listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general i would reccomend this show to anyone as long as they can handle the language
<START> i was hoping this would be of the calibre of das boot and echo the stark realism created by acclaimed german director leni riefenstahl in her documentaries sadly i was monumentally disappointed the story line is implausible and defies credulity an raf airman is shot down and somehow finds his way to a hospital in dresden anna a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to become engaged to a doctor she works with falls in love with the airman and they make love the next evening at a lavish engagement party the airman turns up disguised as a german officer and dances with anna although well directed and acted to me it is soap opera of the lowest order
<START> the director of directed the first indian film i had seen dil se which led me down the path of buying well over hindi dvds in the br br course of four months i can say i understood the total attraction i was br br somehow confused as to why the film would stop for music videos it was an excellent movie i didn't know what to make of the dancing and the female br br vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears but somehow i found ar score hypnotic i bought the soundtrack the following day and then hota hai and k3g the following week and with the exception of ichi the br br killer a few other korean films i can't be bothered to watch much else kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of hong kong horror br br and action science fiction films for the past 30 years br br but i should get back to it is one of the mani latest efforts and i laughed cried got totally mad terrified and most of all i didn't feel manipulated the acting was superb the photography was beautiful i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting the music fit the movie perfectly and after the br br credits rolled i wanted to watch again so i did br br it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop this is what great film is all about i stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over br br my wife is watching now and i can't wait for her reaction i can't expect it will be anything less than mine
<START> this movie is awful if you're considering to see this movie two words do not it's tasteless the storyline is really lame and the jokes are even worse the acting is really pathetic i can't believe that this movie was made rather watch american pie going greek or road trip if you're in the mood for a teen comedy it's about two girls who head for malibu on their spring break as usual they didn't do much planning and called i think her names michelle 's uncle to crash at his malibu mansion uncle bennie strictly forbids them of having any kind of party and as you would of guessed they go ahead and do it please i urge you do not see this movie
<START> the incident is by far the director dustin best film which isn't saying much in his past films and i use the term films loosely the director takes ideas from hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them the incident is no different the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production the film is riddled with out of focus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes for example almost every on screen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screen br br the weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue in a sentence the story strings together like an exposition of overused hollywood clichÃ©s the movie begins with the worst cgi alien ship ever made crashing into the worst cgi earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate next a bus of prison transports carrying the worst of the worst from across the state is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants the prisoners escape and run into the town of where they encounter the aliens who shock have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy the prisoners and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the international space alliance rolls eyes bombs the city into oblivion br br the only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors who are clearly undermined by the script are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire other than that the movie really isn't worth anyone's time let alone the plastic that the dvd is made out of how awful was it let's just say the secretary of defense is about 90 years old works in a room that is about as high tech 1950's real estate office and is wearing a looney tunes tie yes if that wasn't clear enough before the man in charge of the pentagon is wearing a tie with bugs bunny and the road runner on it the movie basically culminates did i say culminates with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the alien ship yeah br br the movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work someone seriously needed to slap the dp and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive stagnant chest level shots this movie really isn't worth renting if it ever makes it that far being that it's not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laugh ability but it's nowhere near watchable cinema
<START> at first i couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary the day after i had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation the film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists including life on earth the lead is clueless and cold he is like all of us he wants to get rich to laugh to travel to eat and be entertained he moves from one place to another in a giant rv without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself by the end it's too late since my first viewing of usa it had grown on me like a custom fit dream where life on earth is nothing but a weird experience i am an artist and a buddhist and this film communicated to my senses it was an ideal embodiment of impermanence this may sound strange but somehow this film was able to touch me in a profound way like no other i recommend it
<START> this thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat i saw it on video some of the landscape at the bluff might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen cast has sandra bullock ben chaplin from the truth about cats dogs michael pitt henry parker in dawson's creek and ryan gosling
<START> oldboy is set in korea starts as a drunken su oh min choi is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted su wakes up finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years su is fed looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the with a however before su finishes he is gassed rendered unconscious when he wakes up su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed all moneyed up su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him after meeting the pretty jeong kang the two fall in love together with her help su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price br br this south korean production was co written directed by chan wook park has gotten any number of glowing reviews the sort that distributors can pick quotes out plaster them on the video box even won the grand prize of the jury at cannes while it was also nominated for the golden palm so surely oldboy is a true classic well not for me it isn't since as i can't understand why it's so liked i would go as far as to say i pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments for a start i couldn't get into the story at all i just didn't like it as i thought it was slow boring while many out there would have you believe oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever i thought it was rather plain not very well executed either the ending in which su goes to the new zealand alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending at almost two hours i almost fell asleep i was so bored the violence is tame it's the thought of what's happening that i would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown in fact oldboy has a very low body count of about seven one mild sex scene it's really not that graphic or memorable i didn't warm to any of the character's while i accept oldboy has an alright concept premise it fails to deliver it's one film that i will never understand why so many people seem to like br br based on a japanese manga of the same name oldboy the film looks alright there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot i was pretty unimpressed thought the fight choreography was quite dull the actual on screen gore violence amounts to very little su eats a live octopus which is apparently quite normal in korea anyway there are some fight scenes a severed hand someones teeth are pulled out there's a bit of blood at the end br br the budget was supposedly around the 4 000 000 mark which is actually a fair bit filmed in south korea new zealand the acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language br br oldboy is a film that i found an absolute chore to sit through i don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as i followed the thing perfectly but i just didn't like any of it it's as simple straightforward as that apparently the second in director choi wook park's revenge trilogy which also includes sympathy for mr vengeance 2002 lady vengeance 2005
<START> the 13th and last rko falcon film starts with the mutual injunction by tom conway as tom lawrence alias the falcon and ed brophy as goldie of no dames whilst they prepare to go on vacation while you're still wondering what they're going on vacation from as they hadn't had a job since the beginning of the 1st film in 1941 with sanders as gay though and jenkins as goldie they bump into a woman and get dragged into a seedy industrial espionage caper br br they promise to help her when her uncle is murdered by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make substitute industrial diamonds to his business colleague in miami suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after lawrence Â and goldie for the murder to console himself goldie keeps paraphrasing travel brochures on the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cosy electric chair for one some nice languid atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with some especially bad behaviour from the baddies favourite bit the dignified game of hide and seek hunt the the imperturbable and suave lawrence has with the baddies on the sleeper train least favourite bit the most embarrassing scene in the entire series in the alligator wrestling hut Â definitely thrown in for the kids br br all in all not the best in the series but yet another entertaining outing with an overall satisfying plot and many episodes even in this that make me wish they could have gone on for just a few more years as columbia did with boston blackie although rko were churning these out faster absolutely no sex not much violence in fact none at all by today's high standards and positively no message all make this type of film anathema to serious people who can only regard movies as an art form that must depend on these three pillars br br three diet were made later with john calvert in the title role i don't mind them but could never bring myself to count them into the main series which tom conway had made his own by this time sad also that it was all downhill after this for conway who moved into tv voice overs and even played norman conquest in park plaza rather well in 1953 he also developed serious eye and alcohol problems Â i don't know if they were linked Â wound up poverty stricken and after a spell in hospital in 1967 was found dead in his girlfriend's bed for us folk that want to at least we still have his 10 entertaining plus a number of other worthy even classic rko movies from 1942 to 1946 with which to remember him by
<START> if this is the author's and director's idea of a slice of life they are clinically manic a sad moody film at best with aimless and unhappy characters who negatively interact with disastrous results this film is billed as a comedy what was so funny about losing your home to an allegedly premeditated arson or the drug induced forcible rape of one of the main characters is this art imitating life jack black was mildly amusing as the mountain man weed farmer however even this segment of the film was rife with pathos what was the point of living in the middle of nowhere with an entourage if black's character was so paranoid why was he doing acid with a group of people right out of woodstock is there no end to disconnected relationships a plot less script and scene transitions lacking any cohesiveness or logical chronology
<START> i've got as much testosterone as the next bloke and raquel welch at her finest is certainly worth a look but the fact is that a cardboard cut out could act better and an hour and half of ms w showing off her considerable assets does not a movie make br br considering the cast it's surprising that it's as bad as it is i've never been a big fan of wagner and his tough guy harry is about as convincing as a 9 dollar bill godfrey cambridge and vittorio de sica both of whom i usually enjoy seem to be sleeping through their lines and as for edward g well i can only assume he was there for the paycheck br br this film is a mess from non existent plot through stop start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60's music if it weren't for miss welch i'd have given it a 0 br br that said she is a treat to the eyes even better than her delicious cameo in 'bedazzled' and for that reason alone i gave it a 3
<START> ya know the concept of guilty pleasures yeah you have 'em like admitting you watched and enjoyed goonies battlestar galactica after they reached earth v the series charlie's angels starsky hutch the 1950s version of superman or godzilla movies br br here's the ultimate in guilty pleasures coupled with jack of all trades in a sam raimi action packed hour this half hour slot is fast paced easy to follow and loaded with fun to watch clad babes br br the man that brought us evil dead xena hercules and the adventures of brisco county jr does it again with this 2000 update of charlies angels we got charlie voice an unknown being that has the and the time to find people who need help bosley the gadget man and three gorgeous babes that kick a for a living br br and oh what a living
<START> i still can't belive that made this film back in 1934 animation is simply perfect and what is amazing about it with all the advanced technology we have nowadays there are few animation studios that are capable of producing a little gem like this one it has everything a great story beautiful although this is a morbid kind of beauty in some cases special effects well it is definitely not a kid's movie but it's a must see for anyone seriously interested in animation
<START> i saw this movie with hopes of a good laugh but when i watched it i didn't stop laughing for weeks they are such bad actors and it made this movie so much funnier to watch btw ryan dunn didn't eat the toy car he shoved it up his ass the random appearances from the skaters and parts were great gimme some grapes vito no your grapes are at the store i wouldn't recommend any one under 13 to watch it frankly they wouldn't understand half of the jokes in or what they are talking about i love and after watching this movie i couldn't help but go buy it or the viva la bam series what is the deal with this stupid comment thing it has to be 10 lines what kind of bull is that i should be able to write one as long or in this case as short as i want i'm just going to keep typing until it tells me i can actually send it its just a waste of time i expected to just say what i wanted it wasn't too much but then i'm told i have to keep putting more in and then it corrects my spelling so what if i didn't spell something right you get what i mean still this is ridiculously long br br those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't
<START> you wear only the best italian suits from armani hand stitched and fitted to your exact your automobile is the finest that german engineering has to offer and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood you're a member of the finest polo clubs frequently dine at restaurants such as and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi automatic 22 caliber gun you snow ski in the alps go deep sea diving in the caribbean sky dive over the and all the while your hair is never ever out of place you are bond james bond the world's most renown spy favorite son of the good queen bad boy of the british ss and perhaps the most desired man in the world the character of james bond was created by ian fleming and is the movie industry's longest lasting icon being the subject of over fifteen films spanning over four decades the latest man to play the role is pierce brosnan who took over the role of james bond from timothy dalton in 1996 and made his 007 debut in goldeneye br br this is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the nintendo 64 goldeneye developed by rare for nintendo has been on the market for some time its continued dominance in the sales charts is just one testament to how good this game is and no review library would be complete without it br br let's face it most of the time movie licensed games are flops although the two seem like a good mix the results for the most part have been horrendous games like cliffhanger true lies lethal weapon and not to mention all the star trek flops are ammunition enough against this mix and for the record i am not a fan of movie licensed games especially if i've seen the movie at least that's how i used to think in the case of goldeneye i had more reservations than normal while not a bad movie goldeneye the film didn't have that much appeal to it and i don't rank it in the top ten amongst bond movies as a game however let's just say it's a completely different story br br the game is a first person shooter and in order to be successful you'll need at least as much brains as brawn for those who have seen the movie which i imagine is most of you reading this the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation a plot to control the world's most dangerous satellite goldeneye has begun in the ussr and in the process a beautiful woman has been captured your missions will be many the danger extreme you will have to rely on your wits and experience to get you through the most grueling missions the world has ever known m will brief you as soon as you're ready good day james
