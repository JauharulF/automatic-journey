<START> copy cats have copied this movie from a 1974 hindi movie called call girl call girl had an identical story line the way in which the protagonists fall in love then rebel and the climax all same in both these films call girl is better than water at least from the story telling point of view it was not as agonizingly slow as water water on the contrary does not progresses at all the aim is perhaps to make the audience sympathize with for ever are indian film makers any better than just being great copiers these days well they call it being inspired in their language it is getting inspired without any citation that is
<START> full of surprises beautiful cruel at times just like life itself leaves one asking for more the best parts are of course the action scenes and chases have to really wonder how much work these guys put into making some scenes whale chases polar bear hunts etc it is a wonderful experience and not to be missed by anyone who dives surfs or goes to the beach once in a while the music is enticing and the narration is superb and extremely well paced definitively one of the best documentaries ever made and worth not less than a very respectable 10 for its kind some of the footage is very cruel and might not be recommended for people with weak stomachs every killer whale footage is cruel
<START> this focuses around the lives of four women all good friends and their male companions each has a story the men as well everything links everybody to everybody and everything is being brought to a quick change after a trip the girls take to palm springs br br basically the film is no different from other of the genre but i liked the details brooke shields is a divorcÃ©e that fears loneliness therefore she bangs just about everybody to get to have a warm body next to her in the morning but then can't really commit as a man i find these women are a blessing but she is not a happy person everything else that happens revolves around this crazy woman but in the end we get more clarity over life and relationships which is good br br i can't tell if the acting was bad it didn't seem to me the script was a little inconsistent but not more than any romantic comedy it's a bit more depressing than most which is good because you don't get dreary romantic comedies every day br br it's worth a watch with the especially if you have cheated on her or plan to
<START> mention bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually conjured up are of tacky over the top musical numbers peopled with costuming that makes vegas seem a bastion of conservatism this perception is not helped by the whiff of condescension that permeates most movies that have approached bollywood from an outsider's perspective willard carroll's romantic comedy however takes a different tack it is not a nudge nudge wink wink look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of bollywood for its vitality its lack of irony and self consciousness br br it is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for bollywood while at the same time is bemused by its aspects and if you have a familiarity with bollywood you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of bollywood and hollywood movie conventions from one of the opening shots a flashback of the salman character as a child by the sea talking with his grandmother played by helen how many salman movies start with this same premise to the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the movie that and prem has been filming anyone who has seen enough bollywood movies will recognize these references the story itself incorporates tried and true conventions from both hollywood and bollywood as well Â the fish out of water meets duty to one's family at the expense of personal fulfillment the structure of the film follows the typical bollywood plot line of the more comical set up of the first half giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second yet ultimately the sensibility of the film is that of hollywood with its understated wry humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself to reach self affirmation br br you couldn't have a movie inspired by bollywood if there weren't any musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them unlike bollywood however the songs do not pop out of nowhere and transport its characters to a european locale or beach they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in busby berkeley movies as being part of a stage show or they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there Â a sexy nightclub scene where prem teaches to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians including a cameo from the playback singer performing all reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the movie often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and put a twist on it from the other so in one of the highlights of the film where comes into her own the song is fairly typical of its genre Â the female star singing and dancing among a line of women Â but in this case it's blond ali looking like a total natural bollywood film star emoting and lip synching to the hindi lyrics with no subtitles br br also synonymous with bollywood are sumptuous visuals and fulfills that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in bollywood today the cinematographer is anil mehta who was also the cinematographer for lagaan and hum dil de chuke sanam the choreographer is vaibhavi merchant and production designer is desai both from hum dil de chuke sanam and devdas you can really see the influence of hum dil de chuke sanam on this film Â in fact the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from taro dhol which coincidentally has an embedded pattern br br as for the cast carroll obviously has a penchant for spotting acting talent as evidenced by playing by heart Â one of the first movies for both angelina jolie and phillippe and in this film he again hits the mark with ali one of the main reasons the film works is because of she makes a bitchy unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart funny and sexy because she is smart and funny she and salman share excellent chemistry and that is one of the film's biggest strengths br br salman khan plays the role of prince charming here as filtered through his iconic role as prem this is old school prem however so expect a quiet subdued salman those used to him in his usual stripping avatar may be disappointed Â or relieved it's a sincere and sensitive performance from him marred only by poor enunciation of his english lines br br with a refreshing lack of cynicism and unabashed embrace of romantic love the film is a love letter to bollywood and hollywood movies of yore
<START> this is my favourite movie of all time and i always think of it as john huston's requiem br br i must have seen it at least 20 times and never tire of it the mood the script the singing the dinner it is like being invited into someone's home and observing the events and not able to participate even though you want to it is a rare treasure this movie and i cannot write enough praise for it br br it is cast incredibly well with quite a few abbey theatre faces and also the wonderful tenor voice of frank patterson lady gregory's poem recited in the movie is one of the most moving ever written scene walking down the stairs as she listens to the song is one of the best performances every seen on film i cry every time i see it for all the right reasons br br we have all had love lost at an early age and weep for our young hopeful selves br br donal mccann acted in far too few movies for my liking he just loved stage work and stuck to it and it is our loss that we do not have more of his performances on film as he does so much with this delicate role by expression and the portrayal of a deep love for his wife that will never be reciprocated and he conveys such inner sadness at knowing this br br if you want your movies action and plot packed avoid this there really is no beginning middle or end just a lens onto the characters at a dinner party in dublin 80 years ago and all the little nuances and shadings of the personalities portrayed so beautifully br br bravo to all who were involved in this production 10 out of 10
<START> an extremely gentle retelling of the shakespeare play and much more overt about it than forbidden planet cassavetes is always a joy to watch and even more so with gena rowlands sharing the spotlight his take on the prospero role is well suited for the sort of craggy all knowing expression he brings to the story this especially comes to the forefront in a scene when upon spotting his estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat he conjures up a storm accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from go this is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe add to this an excellent performance by raul julia plus good work by susan sarandon vittorio gassman and molly ringwald and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes
<START> as a modern marco polo from venice to china here we come again taking on the task to render us the grey area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors eroded by collateral damages the pessimistic vision of europe is mutual with br br the view of that charming but puzzling country is dealt from below devoid of any claim to learn or impose opinions reality nonetheless is harsh abandoned and exploited children beehive homes backward areas is the other china we ignore vincenzo castellitto a technician of a steel factory is one of us his voyage to china is a pretext to understand to learn from the inside a country where progress and third world problems live together in an infamous balance it's not exactly clear if vincenzo knew by the first time that the mechanical component was already been fixed i think so anyway is a minor aspect liu the chinese girl is the key of the whole film she carries on her back a lot of difficulties she's got the strength to overcome but how could she fight with little money and little help br br the realistic and unbiased view of the facts by the girl refusing vincenzo's money touched me a lot a pack of bank notes can't get back her husband her baby forced to treat like a stranger for the law protect her by scorns liu knew his intentions were benign and kind far from a cold charity act their friendship is beautifully narrated the way it grows step by step dignified and formative unique a priceless legacy to keep br br some scenes are stunning either for the acting vincenzo crying on the ferry or by the dialogues at the restaurant on the railroads besides a careless editing and a pretty lazy start la stella che non is brilliant and sharp just because chronicles the untold br br in competition at 63rd venice film festival plenty bet on tai ling for the mastroianni prize dedicated to emerging stars she definitely deserved that award br br 8 10
<START> i never made any comment here on imdb but as i saw this movie i cant be quiet i just set up my account here only because this horrible movie in two words this movie is pure crap the movie has no sense at all nothing makes sense in this movie watching this movie was pain all the way i don't understand why val kilmer agreed to do this movie he plays a minor role as a gang leader says few words and he is there like 5 minutes total br br i bought this dvd based only because of val kilmer name on the box and the interesting pictures on the cover br br as was stated in other review moscow zero stole my money and i want it back the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it zero
<START> this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldn't go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far and it's a far more zany ride br br essentially the film is a science fiction set in future shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where it's illegal to procreate sho reprises a similar role from dead or alive 2 and riki is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isn't one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was anti homosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be left wing but i can't see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of action packed and poignant moments to doa 2 although in this film the action is more martial arts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and it's nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically there's a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments it's a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isn't that part of the charm
<START> i expected so much more than what i received from watching this movie it is not that i object to literary license if that is what it should be called especially when there is no overt attempt to say based on a true story but this movie is about beethoven a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded into our musical experiences and i expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements this movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappoint br br my assumption because i had not researched the movie at all was that it was true half way through i stopped the movie to look it up on imdb the rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience i was relieved that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story to enjoy this movie i was required to recognize it as a fantasy a what if it was like this story the movie lacked this honest disclaimer br br what disappointed me most was the fictionalized conducting of the 9th symphony the very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredulity i ended up doubting anything was true to history other than ludwig van beethoven and his relationship with karl van beethoven br br i really enjoyed the performance of ed harris an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that i give it a 3 10 br br those who that this movie is as good as or better than amadeus have not a clue about either either composers life and are looking only for what this movie really is for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story pulp fiction
<START> straight from the brilliant mind of animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz or the mascot as it is known nowadays stands as a masterpiece of stop motion animation that sadly has been almost forgotten by now nevertheless the work of this man deserves to be seen and in fact must be seen to be believed because the outstanding way the animation flows is simply unbelievable br br decades before toy story starewicz conceived the idea of moving toys in he tells the story of a small stuffed dog that gets makes friends with the sick daughter of his maker one day his maker takes him away to sell him and the adventure begins as he tries to find his way back home in his odyssey he'll travel from paris to hell and will find the other toys that were supposed to be sold with him br br it is a surreal experience to watch this movie as starewicz makes every imaginable creature come alive with grace and beauty the other toys include a beautiful ballerina who loves a thief but she also is secretly loved by a clown forming a love triangle an old woman a stuffed cat and a stuffed ape complete the group every toy is so detailed and very expressive that without words one can understand their motives br br truly the surreal atmosphere the whole animation has it is remarkable it is hard to believe that a work of this magnitude was done in 1934 since it looks even better than most of the current day animation the influence it has in modern day animator such as tim burton and henry selick is very significant br br this short is a masterpiece of animation and the outstanding work of one genius who done everything by himself and that has influenced animators for decades starewicz's work is an immortal piece of art that should be seen by everyone this work is not only for kids adults as well will enjoy it and probably catch most of the subtext hidden in the movie br br it is possible to find it in the vampyr dvd as a bonus feature anyone with the slightest interest in animation should give it a look
<START> one should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the second coming and the third testament that they had read the other two or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and judgement day this film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in jesus religion or philosophy there is only the standard british social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs br br actually good candidates for a real third testament have been published several times like a course in miracles or conversations with god they all have thought provoking new twists and angles for christian faith and theology br br the most interesting information in imdb's rating is not the number of stars but how many people who have bothered to vote in four years only people have bothered to vote for this film as usual the enthusiasts are the most eager for comparison have a look at jesus christ superstar original version from 1973
<START> this film exhibits dear irony shaggy dog roundabout story lines woven with subtle cultural references classic parallels masterful use of rich saturated color and fabulous rendition of chase scenes a'la keystone cops br br the ensemble work of the cast and entire crew is charming literally how else could i go on so br br this film speaks to everyone the deft and poignant use of so many universal archetypes that's what makes this film so deep down satisfying br br as a mature student of film i find checking out contains all the vital elements sure and it's not the godfather but would serve perfectly as follow up mandatory play that sweetly binds our collective cathartic wounds br br get thee to a theatre and see this film you will be treated to a unique masterpiece
<START> i got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma com with the ruining which isn't much better the main reason i wanted it was to see star worms ii attack of the pleasure pods the dvd is a double feature with that movie i really didn't know what maximus was at the time and when i saw the trailer i got scared it looked awful but hey what can you tell from the trailer well apparently i could tell a lot this movie honestly made no sens to me the special effects were so terrible you cannot tell what in god's name is going on i understand mark hicks had a extremely low budget but come on and it is sad because in the interview he sounded like this was to be an epic film and meant more than you could see but sadly watching the film is one of the most boring hour and 15 minutes of anyone's life it is so utterly painful to sit through i really can't even explain the plot to you because i didn't understand it at all and i have sadly seen this film two times apparently they used some type of puppets for the alien dinosaurs like they did in star wars but these special effects are awful i can't stress it enough and most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly it takes place on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs battle each other and bad actors in hooded run around and they look like they are in the kkk and some box with a blue light on it is the president i know in the interview mark hicks said something about making this a television pilot well i can see why this didn't make it to cbs or nbc there are two good things about this film 1 the music is actually pretty good it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days and 2 lloyd kaufman's introduction is as always hilarious overall don't waste your time but check out star worms ii attack of the pleasure pods
<START> in the 1980's patriotism and in some cases flat out jingoism was pretty high do we get to win this time a line famous from rambo first blood part ii could almost sum up how many people felt at that time a longing for the style of films they grew up with flat out balls to the wall we're good your bad now let's blow something up and go home while rambo rocky and for the most part top gun seemed more geared towards attracting an older crowd iron eagle went straight for the kids canadian writer and director sidney j furie brings out everything that you love and hate about that time period the kick in the pants rock out 80's anthems never say die road of the gypsy etc to the over the top and sometimes almost unbelievable action adventure iron eagle succeeded for one reason it was f u n fun it's the type of movie you can turn on and sit back and enjoy every ridiculous totally 80's moment you don't have to think about if it could really happen or if the acting is truly believable it's just fun and that's all you can really ask for in this type of movie
