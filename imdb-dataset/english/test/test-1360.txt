<START> the buddy holly story shows the famous singer's beginnings in the dunk texas to his rise to stardom to his tragic death in a plane crash strengthened by the fact that gary busey as holly plays his own instruments this movie is the biopic in its purest form there are some things that seem a little hackneyed namely the people of considering rock 'n' roll to be the devil's music but the masterful performances outweigh any weaknesses if there's only one thing that's for certain in this great big world of ours it's that buddy holly's music will never get stale whether it's that'll be the day peggy sue or another one of his songs they still sound great after all these years he remains one of the greatest singers in history br br just to show what really thought of their most famous son they didn't name a street after him until 37 years after his death what a bunch of
<START> first of all the whole idea of remaking a classic such as psycho is nothing short of ludicrous a lot of time and effort was wasted here i am sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve on the original so they must have had a tribute to alfred hitchcock on their minds however the idea that began as a well intentioned tribute results in being a slap in the face to the horror master this movie is poorly produced poorly acted and unnecessary to begin with the original classic stands well on it's own even after 40 years the event of hitch returning from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of trash is unlikely but if i were them i would sleep with one eye open just in case don't waste your time
<START> disney's buena vista pictures presents a wonderfully told fact based sports drama directed by actor bill paxton photography is superb but story sometimes lumbers along this film is about the 20 year old amateur golfer francis shia labeouf and his competition in the 1913 u s open what a story a once in a lifetime chance for a supposedly incapable young man to play along side the best golfers of the time including british champions harry stephen and ted ray stephen marcus a storybook ending leaves a knot in the throat the cast also includes peter firth elias koteas marnie robin wilcox and possibly stealing the show is josh flitter who plays eddie lowery caddy and best friend
<START> people who thought that the chronicles of riddick sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed up event horizon probably didn't see the movie that spawned vin diesel's skin headed killer to begin with and probably have no intention of doing so too bad because pitch black actually does kick major ass br br directed by genre vet david warlock and the excellent but underrated below and written by siblings jim and ken wheat lies silent scream pitch black begins with an 'alien' esque prologue when a combination cargo freighter passenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower in which the captain is also killed the co pilot carolyn fry silent hill's radha mitchell has an important decision to make ditch the cargo or the passengers close to picking ore over occupants the crash landing derails her ultimate course of action br br no matter because the catastrophic landing has been made on a foreboding rock that once held a mining colony amongst the survivors are a couple of settlers shazza claudia black and zeke john moore an imam keith david and his young followers can you say red shirts boys and girls an antiques dealer named paris lewis fitz gerald a 'young boy' named jack griffith and the most controversial members of the group a marshall named johns the excellently slimy cole hauser and his prisoner a dangerous murderer named riddick diesel br br how the group dynamics shake out make for a lot of the dramatic tension especially with concerns about riddick and how many people he might slice and dice if he ever gets away but no one here gets out alive as the saying goes and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along than how they'll survive when they discover the unthinkable they are not alone on the things that are hungry and quick are around just where they can't be seen living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive they want the flesh of the new arrivals to sate their appetites but they can't come out into the searing daylight to for food br br does the phrase total eclipse make things a little more interesting you betcha hence the more than fitting title br br vin more monosyllabic than clint eastwood's dirty harry on his grumpiest day dripping more testosterone than sweat has a field day here with a character that really does seem worth a sequel or two and hauser oozing menace and bile is every bit as good as his dad wings was at on screen villainy surprisingly though mitchell holds her own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as fry you would expect no less than a strong showing from black she who once was sun' and she doesn't disappoint too bad her role wasn't bigger but that's all i'll say about it and david makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will truly be tested in the very pit of hell itself br br the pace moves faster than riddick slipping up behind his prey with a shank in his teeth and once the darkness descends the terror and tension never let up pretty much as in other classic sci fi horror flicks which this imitates but if imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery dave and the deserve major for getting this one right with a vengeance and for giving us an ending that is anti hollywood to the max br br i don't want to spoil the surprises so i won't say much more except that if you saw chronicles first and weren't too happy give pitch black a chance anyway and if you've seen neither definitely start with this one br br i don't know what vin is up to now but he could certainly do worse than to give these guys a call again i'd love to see what they would dream up next
<START> this looks so good on paper matt damon lawrence fishbourne jean reno nice right and a heist with 42 million sounds like a kick ass crime movie br br big disappointment i reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy br br but more than that it the pseudo reservoir dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong it's very much made for tv stuff br br all in all hugely disappointing it score points for being what it is but loses them massively for being bluntly not very interesting at all
<START> this might have a spoiler br br when i first started watching this movie i thought it was ok the music was good and that bizarro dream sequence i was willing to forgive but the lack of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me uninterested in watching the rest of this film i know totally vain the music at the beginning was spirited and fitting i thought for a mock gothic novel but come on saxophone music for an early 19th century film it totally didn't fit this movie was totally boring and if you're looking to watch a good period film or an austen don't rent northanger abbey i give it a 30 30 a failing grade
<START> oh mr carell how far you've fallen after a glowing moment in little miss sunshine steve carell's choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since although the 40 year old virgin was entertaining it was dwarfed by his sunshine character hoping to find something that'd get me to spew popcorn from my nose i decided to rent evan almighty and see what possible guffaws might await me here not much br br given the trite and clichÃ©d script the entire film felt forced and unemotional poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current u s administration's take on the environment evan almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserably br br nearly every person on earth knows the story of noah and the ark god's wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while noah his family and two of each of his creatures on earth rode out the in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark it was a huge moment in human history if you believe the biblical text br br so why would god appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the world's animals for a few minutes after a dam break the simple answer is that he never would too much emphasis was given to u s government policy and not enough on world events making evan almighty a terribly myopic and centric film although designed as a comedy it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs maybe a few grunts and a smile but little else br br john goodman cars pulls in another forced performance as the despicable congressman chuck long who's only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land even the strong presence of morgan freeman 10 items of less as god can't help mop up this soaking wet disaster of a film br br the only funny moments are between carell and the animals especially as evan learns what animal magnetism is really like birds literally flock to him sheep herd around him lions take pride in being near him please forgive the puns br br the special effects were fun to watch but were brief with good reason the flood was interesting in that the ark was obviously guided by his hand and shoved in just the right direction br br but other than that you're in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect
<START> ok lets get one thing straight i love dinosaur movies even the bad ones so with this in mind lets proceed raptor is a truly awful film in fact its not even a film in its own right as it is cobbled together from bits of carnosaur carnosaur 2 primal species carnosaur 3 there is some new footage with eric roberts as a sheriff and his busty sidekick running around looking confused frightened or whatever it is there trying to convey badly on the emotional scale but then how can they react to something that was filmed several years earlier the producers yes roger corman i'm talking about you even went to the lengths of hiring 2 people from carnosaur to play bit parts so there grisly death scenes can be reused so this film is the cheapest of the cheap watch the 3 original movies there no oscar winners but they have some and entertainment value but avoid raptor oh it also has the most pointless sex scene that runs for nearly 10 minutes do you think they were trying to pad out the running time
<START> has a very unique story and i will never look at spirals the same way again not really spine tingling horror this film has a dark morose acid trip feel to it during certain parts was it just me or did you see vortex visuals the camera shots are interesting and the movie lets your imagination run wild the bizarre supernatural feel of this film draws you in just as the title suggests acting is done well and the town setting itself seems wrong with to begin with br br this may take a few viewings for it to sink in a great trippy film
<START> this is the ultimate and i mean the ultimate adventure classic the plot is good versus evil there have always been an abundance of films that depict gray areas and not enough on the basic good against evil to account for the real cases of good against evil in the real world only recently have film makers tried to even the odds in real life well over half of situations are black and white but only a fraction of movies make it seem that way this movie is the best example of a back and white look it is best seen in black and white the hero is in the worst situation he is in the territory of a man who wants to murder him and among various enemies the movie gives the feel that he is hopelessly outnumbered and can't count on help his enemy the count has numerous resources the count's wife was forced into marriage with him and she knows from his past history that sooner or later he will kill her as he does all his wives she and the hero become allies and fall in love in away that could win over anyone watching unless that person just wants to be a contrary brat anyone who helps them is killed they have no escape the situation is hopeless so will they survive in the end you won't guess unless you've read spoilers the movie also has a lot of great atmosphere adventure and intrigue along with lon chaney as a bad guy and boris karloff in his best role ever as a decent guy usually cast as a bad guy karloff was at his best when presented with more complex roles such as this one chaney was rarely given a complex role although he his stuff in a few movies such as of mice and men this is little more than a cameo for him still the tension never stops there is suspense and danger throughout perfectly written perfectly cast and perfectly directed this is what a movie should be pure escape pure adventure
<START> it'll soon be 10 yrs since this movie was released still makes me laugh if u enjoy this film try the new hera pheri as hilarious and my favourite bit of the film must be when salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point and he actually says it out loud u just wanna bash him but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing fantastic film 10 10
<START> very intelligent language usage of ali which you musn't miss in one word sentence wicked so keep it real and pass it on
<START> a very mediocre film based on a superb series of stories and novels i hope somebody someday will be able to film it the right way in the meantime look for the books by a a very postmodern fantasy by now there should be a translation in english there translations in german for sure
<START> i knew nothing about this film until i watched it my brother in fact suggested i take a look normally his suggestions aren't much cop however but i was stuck for something to watch so i watched it br br well to cut a long story short i give it 10 10 br br the film centers around two people that meet whilst lodging at the same place one is initially very dependant upon the institution around him the other is a rebel one does what he likes the other as he's told br br from the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building and see how they rub off a little on each other it's a remarkable piece of work that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist people leaping out of bath tubs or superheros coming to save the day br br there's a fair amount of grit and reality in there not everything can ever go just right not all can ever be spanned and this film delightfully shows the lot br br if you watch this film and are not impressed i'd suggest that you don't watch anything again
<START> now don't get me wrong i love seeing half naked chicks wiggling around it's part of the fun of a moroccan restaurant ogling the belly dancers but it doesn't make much of a plot br br my first major problem is the music i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote the vampire lestat the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked though i could be wrong i know relating to current goth music might have seemed like a good idea but they did a horrific job incorporating it lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking br br second and someone else said it mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea lestat could have been a movie in it's own right and a damn good one if done right i honestly don't think queen of the damned lends itself to a movie very well though i would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story there's too much how to word this inaction in the book for it to be a very interesting movie and the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly now mind you it's been a long time since i've read it i always thought lestat tale of the body thief and the devil were much more action packed and would have made better movies br br i know a lot of people hey myself included who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture i tend to agree with them there aaliyah had a nice body though
