<START> i love those kind of movies blood revenge a lot of action very dark cheesy and more but this one doesn't deliver the genre that you might expect when i saw kite birds and ichi the killer before i had fun watching those but why this one not dead or alive final is a decent anime and its not hardcore and don't even expect nudity in this movie at least add some more action to entertain the audience even the drama wasn't that good well i don't want to spoil the movie nor the plot but i felt that dead or alive final is a bit nerdy so without further to do i don't recommend this movie to everyone but i recommend for the people who love decent and well directed anime br br dr jacques coulardeau university of paris dauphine university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
<START> personally i think the movie is pretty good it almost rates an 8 i liked the aspect as well as the gorgeous photography colin firth's character isn't the most likable but he does a better than decent job with the role the heroine played by the beautiful long is a familiar film heroine in that she's trying to do what she thinks is the best for her child marrying a respected member of her expatriate community while fighting her attraction for the bad man one who's not a member of her community the outsider most of the film is about this mother's struggle should she do what's expected of her what she thinks is best for her son or should she follow her heart i don't want to give away the ending let me just say that it's a feel good movie with gorgeous location shots exquisite african dress it's worth seeing the film just for the women's brilliantly colored african clothing and and likable characters overall the actor who plays long's son is bright and adorable the plot is a bit formulaic but i liked the movie nonetheless if you're a colin firth fan you must see this film if you like chic flicks see it i think i'll watch it again tonight
<START> in the last few years of ron miller's son in law of walt disney cum producer reign he churned out live action crap on a stick often starring the very boring dean jones whose entire career was based on that kind of light empty headed fare other horrible films from that same period include pete's dragon the last flight of noah's ark unidentified flying oddball and the dreaded i'll not mention tron because i thought it ambitious and miller was only the executive producer on it so he had little to do with the actual production however he was in full force when this god awful piece of human junk was expelled from the bowels of creativity herbie goes to monte carlo second sequel to much loved love bug tale finds herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too there's a race some lame bad guys a diamond and barney fife shot in france the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely but one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in france the rest of film is a wreck prat falls bumbling thieves wicked german racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply the biggest insult of the film trying to further develop herbie's lover personality via shakes beeps flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old disney's writers do an injustice to our cute little vw then again i would think it'd be tough for anyone to top helen hayes driving herbie around a skyscraper ledge in the second outing
<START> i wonder sometimes if maybe meryl streep has become so accepted as the most impressive versatile actress since well maybe just about the beginning of the sound era that maybe her talent is now taken for granted there are probably about three tics that she relies on consistently throughout her performances most noticeably a pinched lip but other than that her performances are amazingly variable and original and fresh expressions of internal workings even though sophie's choice and a cry in the dark and may be her work here and in bridges in madison county is remarkable too just more subtle in one true thing she is mostly sweet and in love with her domesticated life and streep makes what could be routine even boring seem attractive and charming i think that she must work out these mini theses for each character and find what things make this person real and interesting she works from the inside out with each character and maybe it's this essential quality that has evoked the main criticism of aloofness or self consciousness i don't think she's cold at all but instead has thought out her character's unique qualities i think her critics are confusing self consciousness with intelligence not too many other actors would be so thoughtful and creative as to make kate lightweight and carefree within her beloved homey environment only to later reveal unprecedented depth because of her genuine attachment to that homey environment her performances are of an unsurpassed consistency she rarely does anything wrong i wonder if it's conceivable for any of streep's pictures to not seem diminished because of her presence anyway kate loves her home and her affection for her family life is as endearing as her new conflict within the home is jarring when all of this comes together and kate starts to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity and she breaks the pie dish and screams out that she is not handicapped it is painfully sad to watch because this has not been someone prone to emotion streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize how much better everything works because she has felt out the dramatic validity of kate and it's really the only scene when she allows her character to go but how refreshingly true it is to see a character who can really surprise you by displaying something that you wouldn't have thought possible once again streep's character has at least three dimensions god this sounds like a thesis itself but as an actress streep just has a special kind of intelligence incredible empathy and great expressive skills the movie itself is probably somewhat mediocre i suppose william hurt is meant to be an unlikeable jerk and he does very well i think hurt is really kind of creepy though script is quite standard another tribute to streep that she was as touching and believable as she was
<START> why watch a tv drama billed as a comedy in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people i can sort of see what the writer david was trying to achieve the and bad taste surprises that he put into one foot in the grave etc i admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on british tv at the moment but really who cares about these people they are cold bores br br another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex boyfriend shagging that was the moment when i switched off this programme never to return br br p s it's interesting to note that the posters who didn't like this series are all british whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries this reflects the fact that when the bbc broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone br br p p s good news for those who liked it there will be a second series in autumn 2007 though without the male lead it sounds like the bbc have decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom
<START> i enjoyed the film very much especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful gong li as the concubine br br it was a little distracting however to have chinese dialogue plus english subtitles plus american accented voice over even though the voice over was very well synchronised br br shi di's the first emperor of family name was and his given name so in the english he should have been referred to as king or emperor and not as king ying as in those days the two family given names were not used together br br the state of is pronounced chin not shin a pity the researchers didn't get this right br br i forgave this but was dismayed at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried at an together with his terra cotta warriors the town is pronounced see an never an surely the american voice over speakers could have got that right
<START> since paul was running short of actual relatives to avenge the third installment in the death wish saga revolves on him returning to new york to visit an old war buddy he arrives only to find out that brooklyn entirely changed into a gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building strikes a deal with the local police commissioner conquers the heart of his blond attorney blows away numerous villains with an impressive magnum gun and gradually trains inspires the petrified new yorkers to stand up for themselves okay there's no more point in defending the death wish series after seeing part three the 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and even though it was pure exploitation part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise apparently isn't an architect anymore he's ten times more social and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody not even the police is against vigilante actions anymore all these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that michael winner and charles bronson reduced their death wish success to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get nastier sleazier meaner and a lot harder to kill however the gentlemen didn't seem to realize that the non stop spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two i once read a brilliant review that referred to death wish 3 as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation this description couldn't be more spot on as the script tiredly moves itself from one repugnant execution sequence to the next particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete orgy of gunfire explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures yi this entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast including martin balsam psycho 12 angry men as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet ed lauter family plot the longest yard as the slightly unorthodox copper and even alex winter from bill and ted's excellent adventure in his debut role as one of the thugs
<START> it is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the 1990's a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the air waves the best producers of saturday morning animation were at warner brothers television who experienced a major golden age with the dream team of steven spielberg tom and paul dini along with serious and dark series like batman they also revived zany outlandish cartoons made famous by the looney tunes animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and today but tiny toon adventures was equally popular by re inventing the looney tunes for a new generation while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group no matter how old even when the tiny toons were stretched to a feature length with how i spent my vacation it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series a curse that so often plagues other feature length adaptations of popular animated shows br br the tiny toon gang are young off springs of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the 1940's and 1950's and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their toon degree summer vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do buster bunny charles adler and babs bunny tress macneille start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to acme acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the mississippi plucky duck joe alaskey joins pig don messick on a cross country car trip to the happiest theme park in the world but family proves to be more difficult than he imagined meanwhile in other stories scattered throughout duff cree summer tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze fifi le fume attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and shirley the loon gail goes to the cinema with a loud mouth rob br br while the premise sounds thin for a feature length film the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together the best of these is unfortunate road trip which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well feeling pity for somebody while also laughing at their predicament annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork story definitely ranks second just to see how a little almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals the aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the fore front with buster and babs' story which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes but also since and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to deliverance including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene featuring the unforgettable tiny toon adventures theme song br br part of the universal appeal of the tiny toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of children's fare that people seem to slap it with an entire segment featuring poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at in a note perfect way along with an additional jab at thx logo that scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing there are also a couple of moments that poke fun at disney world cinematic plot holes and even warner's legal department the fact that today's cartoons are bland and un creative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come close br br after watching how i spent my vacation for the first time in many years i can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to with the ongoing censorship that today's family entertainment receive one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again this review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film but also a plea for spielberg and dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again lord knows that the children of the twenty first century is in need for something with the intelligence of tiny toon adventures this is not a simple cash grab it is a wonderful film with full of spirit madcap mayhem and hilarity
<START> i have viewed this cartoon as a child a father and now a grand father it is my favorite cartoon i love the characters the great little tunes and the very good drawings i totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon i think it is a beautiful little cartoon everyone i have shown it to simply loves it it is too bad it opened on such a bad day pearl harbor bombing if it wasn't for the bad timing it would have been a great success i hope i can find a dvd of it because all the vhs tapes don't do it justice br br i think if anyone shows it to their child they will come up with the same result they will just love it br br
<START> i carefully checked if there's another movie named as this one and there isn't but i really don't think we all saw the same movie there's no way how can you vote more than 1 for this movie the idea of this movie let's say it's acceptable oh and the acting of dan gordon chris is quite good but those are the only two things acceptable in this project the others are awful it's a very delicate word to describe the acting of the other actors the directing the so said special effects even the way that the crew was filming i don't even like the way that the camera operators were moving to record the scenes this may be the most miserable film i've ever seen i really don't remember a movie lower than this one maybe there is but i don't think so ehh what's done it's done that's the movie and there's too late for anyone to change anything i've voted 1 but my realistic vote starts with a minus in front
<START> this movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in english history the film version of cromwell's growing involvement in the war is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off this film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the civil war was in no way catholic versus protestant both sides were protestant cromwell was never present at the battle of nor did he ever save the day the did not win the battle ended in a draw br br as another reviewer has noted cromwell was certainly not one of the five members who were to be removed from the house and arrested br br overall this movie was decent the producers tried way to hard and it didn't turn out so great br br definitely could have been better
<START> a stunningly harrowing account of two soldiers plight in wwii set against a freezing backdrop of not only the fight against the nazis and traitors in but the harsh natural elements this film tells a tale of two soldiers of polarized morals one who survives but finds it somewhat impossible to deal with his own circumstances and one who dies having done all that can be done in the face of intimidation and everything possible to break one's spirit in fact the ascendant of the title a film that should be seen by all particularly for the phenomenal performances of the main characters and shuddering set pieces the incarceration and hanging scenes in particular an absolute must see
<START> in dublin the crippled rebel rory o'shea james mcavoy moves to the residential home for the disabled affecting the lives of the residents roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of michael connolly steven robertson who was left in the shelter by his prominent father many years ago due to his cerebral palsy and they become close friends rory convinces michael to move from to an apartment in dublin and they hire the gorgeous siobhan romola garai to assist them living together with rory michael faces a new world finding friendship love and freedom and learning to survive by his own br br inside i'm dancing is a wonderful tale of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story the acting of steven robertson and james mcavoy are awesome and i do not understand how they have not been nominated to the oscar with such magnificent performances romola garai has also a top notch performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy the screenplay is touching never corny and without redemption and the precise direction of damien o'donnell is very sensitive unfortunately the brazilian title of the dvd is shamefully ridiculous giving a wrong idea of this excellent movie my vote is eight br br title brazil os dias de the best years of our lives
<START> it is ok movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends it is way below limits be called professional there isn't plot no actors' play and visual looks like you see it through the plastic film i was so glad that i have ff button on my remote worked really well i understand that everyone need to start somewhere but it shouldn't be reason to bring it to the public if you have concerns about quality and budget open water was made on and more than half went to the guy who provided the security in the ocean and trained sharks and that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the indy film making
<START> this is a sort of hidden gem it has little to no promotion no fanfare no classic status and it deserves all of the above one of the great directors of cinema fritz lang has created a real gem in this excellent western a fine cast led by randolph scott in probably one of his greatest performances the always sturdy dean jagger robert young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors chill wills slim summerville john carradine barton and others in an exciting zane grey story of the laying of the western union cable across country it has tense drama of humor and great effects it's reminiscent of demille in ways and yet fritz lang leaves his own stamp on it at very least this is a damned good western
