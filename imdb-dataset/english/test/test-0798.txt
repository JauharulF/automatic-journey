<START> contains major spoilers on the off chance you would actually care about the story line br br ok we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker who the power grid br br predictable schlock from the start and if that weren't enough the 5 second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been for example will they make it to the airport in time things look dim as we go to a the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane well i guess they're gonna make it after then again they had to because they're good guys br br the acting wasn't any too impressive exception and welcome relief randy quaid as tornado tommy the effects were kinda lame the bad guys got it and the good guys came through the real disaster of this movie was the script especially the ending not only did they wrap things up happily as quickly as a soap opera given 24 hours notice of a cancellation but they glorified the hacker as well intentioned so he caused a bazillion meant well and of course an uplifting final tv report about people coming together barf it was everything i expected from the commercials and i'm glad i wasted my time watching it it will make great conversation at the lunch table tomorrow br br is cbs insulting us by making this we watched it didn't we did you count many ads there were for home backup generators during this pig br br here's hoping for the next plan 9 from outer space which gets better with each viewing this isn't it br br 1 star
<START> this film derives from a long running itv sitcom by the same name the sitcom lasted for half a decade roughly and brought to our screens phillip alan mrs jones vienna br br then in 1980 the film version hit the cinemas now when it did sadly richard beckinsale had passed away was replaced by only when i laugh actor chris br br i myself felt this gave the film a different feel i would have preferred if it wasn't shot as richard was a key character thats like having the porridge film without or mackay br br the film did have some classics moments definitely but it felt a bit de ja vu many parts were seen before in the tv series now if you saw the movie first rather than the series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan br br saying that leonard is definitely on top form and makes the movie just like in the tv series the film has recently had a new lease of life on dvd and is usually on terrestrial over a quiet weekend it is a cracking good film but for fans you may feel that youv'e seen it similarly before br br saying that though its worth a buying watching br br 7 8 10
<START> i really hoped for the best with this one but it just didn't happen financed at a very non dutch manner and still looking great with a style and pace that's very much like hollywood what i don't understand is how with all these great benefits the director writer producer still managed to make this film a completely horrible picture to watch filled with bad jokes cheap nudity and actors that just can't really talk act in the english language for pulling it off but what was this guy thinking
<START> i'm a big fan of thomas harris i read all his novels at least 5 times and the book i really love the most therefore the movie was my biggest disappointment and i really don't get it why some folks here give it a nine or even a ten either their demands are very low or they haven't read the book or both even if i hadn't read the book i'd still consider the movie as absolute average and i'd give it a five the creepy mysterious atmosphere from the novel doesn't appear one single time in the movie when i saw it first in the cinema i even fell asleep why was margot verger a very important character totally omitted why was barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money and most of all why was the psychological process starling went through in the end caused by the drugs lecter applied to her descended not to speak about the fact that the ending was omitted too and totally changed well the reasons why jodie foster refused to play starling again are well known and i accepted it although like surely many others i'm very disappointed 'cause i identified starling with her for stories like red dragon the silence of the lambs or hannibal that possess such psychological depth it is very important to identify with a character when they're adapted for the screen but as the germans say that's snow of yesterday ridley scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesn't live up to his name jonathan demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot the characters and their relationships towards each other in the silence of the lambs he should have done hannibal too my only comfort is that i've seen the movie only two times it's long ago and thank god for that reason i'm able not to see the scenes from the movie when i read the novel i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone
<START> i saw this film at the sundance film festival and i too was surprised that it didn't generate more notice because it was not only powerful and beautifully crafted but very original the audience was totally engaged and the greatest part of seeing a film like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and cast in the q a session afterward they literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next film we could have gone on for a lot longer the film is thought provoking and hilarious at the same time it will be a shame if this film isn't picked up for wider distribution i hope it will at least become available on dvd because i want to see it again and share it with everyone i know
<START> one of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as the murder mystery as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays and since horror films were very popular in those years by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade in which the first movies of the genre were produced aspiring playwright charles saw in this renewed interest in murder mysteries a chance to make a name for himself after warner bros picked his three act play the wax works to create the 1933 horror film mystery of the wax museum joined independent filmmaker frank r strayer to keep making films and the ghost walks was one of his best br br in the ghost walks john miljan plays prescott ames a young playwright who wants to impress a famous broadway producer named herman wood richard carle with his new play ames takes wood and his assistant homer johnny arthur to his country house for a reading of his play but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm the three men ask for refugee in an old mansion which happens to be property of one of old acquaintances inside the house wood and homer witnesses the strange relationship between ames and the house owners however this is all a plan conceived to impress wood everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery unfortunately the murder committed is done for real and while wood and homer think it's all fake after discovering original plan the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer br br as expected charles screenplay for the ghost walks features the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of its time as we have the stormy night at an old dark house as setting the obligatory group of suspects and the touch of comedy however what's interesting here is how makes the film a real spoof on the genre with the many twists he puts in his story to play with the clichÃ©s of murder mystery plays the dialogs are excellent full of wit and lighthearted charm and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam by the end it follows the murder mystery routine anyways it never fails to be interesting and entertaining thanks to its smart twists and specially its quirky characters interestingly there's an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical it's never denigrating and it's genuinely funny at times br br by 1934 director frank r strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the poverty row side of the film industry but his partnership with writer charles would give him a couple of his most interesting movies and the ghost walks was one of them while obviously done on a shoestring budget and the typical production values of independent films of its time strayer manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric movie that fits nicely the mood and tone of the story the pacing is a little too slow at times but strayer knew that the power of his film was on script and makes the most of it letting his cast to make the most of their characters with excellent results certainly the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal but strayer makes an effective albeit restrained work in this film br br as written above the screenplay is filled with great lines that make the quirky characters shine and fortunately most of the cast play with this to their advantage veteran character actor richard carle is remarkably funny as cranky producer herman wood adding a lot of charm to his character specially in his scenes with johnny arthur who plays the flamboyant secretary homer arthur is the one who gets the most best scenes and he gives and hilarious performance as the cowardly yet witty assistant john miljan is just effective as ames nothing amazing but nothing really bad and the same could be said about june collyer as gloria shaw the obligatory love interest whom is just fine however donald is really enjoyable as the malicious terry shaw and it's a shame he didn't get more screen time br br as usual with frank r strayer films the low budget hurts the film badly as while strayer makes the best he can the film still feels kind of plain at times however the main problem is problem the very slow pace it has as even when the film is filled with sparkly moments of witty dialogs it moves at a pace so slow that can become boring and tedious for moments it also must be said that while effective in their roles miljan and collyer are pretty dull and average when compared to arthur and carle and one wishes the movie had been more focused on the comedic pair they make than on the main couple finally as written above the ending is kind of weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts although credit must go to for keeping creative plot twists appearing until the very end br br one could say that charles is an unsung hero of the murder mystery genre as among the many horror and mystery films that came out the b movie studios nicknamed as the poverty row the ghost walks is easily among the best previous film the bat despite its shortcomings and even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre it's a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it pokes fun at its own origin as a murder mystery play a very recommended film if you like the genre 7 10
<START> boom boom is a rip off from the movie amadeus i personally rate amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is about music which is my favorite subject but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music he produced during his life time but for his own self destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35 being virtually during his life time because of the politics played by some people particularly the italian composer who was jealous of him br br personally i was shocked to see as the director has invariably cut pasted most of the scenes from the movie amadeus i see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and am skeptic about the kind of movies bollywood keeps on churning day by day the movie is a disaster the two musicians in the movie don't give you any feeling of being realistic the film is tasteless meaningless and total failure on every count the only person who makes an impact is bobby deol who at least knows how to act otherwise the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs br br the irony is that while watching the movie the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance with anyone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie because all resemblances are very much clear and they are very much intended i wish i could take darshan and co to court not only for copyright infringement but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art
<START> well it took them 4 tries but they finally got it right in this 4th sequel to the karate kid franchise the producers really hit a home run well first of all i applaud them for finally getting rid of ralph macchio i felt he never did service to the role of the karate kid i would have rather have seen danny mouth' most in that role macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series and look where his career is now instead they put in a girl they got hillary swank best known for playing a variety of parts in every movie she is in i personally don't care for her buck teeth but thats a personal preference but still look how karate kid 4 launched her career into orbit she won a freakin oscar christmas meanwhile where is ralphy he should put out some amateur porn tape like screech or something br br anyways my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate as a self proclaimed master of karate i have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5 8 years the first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls well except for judo but thats kinda gay so for the purposes of accuracy i think they should have stuck with another male for this role i was thinking perhaps dennis franz he would give the role the depth it requires br br perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in karate kid 5 its too pat marita is no longer i was thinking maybe justin is the perfect replacement for the lovable asian fellow mr miyagi he will give wax on wax off a whole new meaning funny huh anyways if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with karate and triumph of the human spirit karate kid 4 is for you don't waste your time with 1 3 this is the karate kid for you this is the karate kid for r the ages
<START> aside from frankie chattering too fast to understand malcolm in the middle flashbacks this film still cannot conjure up a scare the idea with the countess and the history surrounding her placed into the story was fun but the plot and many side plots just don't tie together plot synopsis murdering ghost lures victims through video game toss in some blood and a special effects and you've got yourself another bombed out would be horror flick the ghost cronies resemble the ghost in the ring two far too much the acting and constant and dramatic change in everyone's emotions is unbelievable save your money
<START> i'm sorry to say that but this is actually one of the worst documentaries i have ever seen br br due to its name darwin's nightmare i expected a documentary on problems relating to the nile perch in lake victoria br br what i actually saw in this documentary is a loose accumulation of individual stories most of which have no relation to neither fish nor lake and for a large part you can hardly call them stories it's more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connection br br why does this movie waste time on showing us non relevant information on the families of the russian pilots several minutes are wasted for example on their private snapshots of wives and daughters mourning the death of an african child who got bitten by a crocodile as if that could not have happened without the nile perch showing us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport showing us strange religious events for several minutes discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport talking to kids about their mothers fathers what they work and or how they died well guess what some died of hiv who would have guessed that those are just some examples i could go on for several pages br br this movie is absolutely unfocused and does not know at all what it wants to tell the viewer if you have never heard of africa and have no idea that this continent has social health hiv violence war problems then this movie might be right for you if you haven't had your eyes closed for the last decades 90 of what this movie shows won't be new to you and the way it's presented here will try its best to make you fall asleep br br perhaps my expectations on this movie were to high but i really didn't like it even though this is a topic that i would generally find interesting if this movie wants to show how the poverty is related to the nile perch than it perhaps should have spent some time on discussing that matter
<START> from the start of the edge of love the viewer is transported to the striking world of ww2 london we follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity except one of the characters is named dylan thomas perhaps the greatest english poet of the 20th century and his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish but at times truly despicable br br this movie is based on thomas' writings about love and romance these were adapted with a sharp screenplay by sharman macdonald keira knightley's mother the director john does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people br br all four are performed very strongly sienna miller is dylan's wife keira knightley is the cabaret singer vera phillips matthew rhys is dylan thomas and cillian murphy is william the first section of the movie takes place in london during the nazi air raids with vera being pursued by willaim a soldier waiting for deployment by a chance encounter dylan meets with his first love vera from there vera meets caitlin dylan's wife while the three are drinking william successfully breaks vera's guard br br the film follows their lives as vera and william are married and he is sent to war vera has become pregnant and returns to wales with dylan and caitlin there they face a gritty existence with vera supporting dylan and caitlin with her husband's war pay through these times vera's and caitlin's friendship grows so does dylan's infatuation with vera she gives in this creates the first test for the two women br br when william returns from war he barely recognizes his wife and has no bond with his infant son things get worse as dylan idly watches his friend struggle with battleground fatigue post traumatic stress disorder william realizes something has happened between dylan and vera and in a drunken rage shoots up dylan's house br br edge of love starts as a stylish romance in war torn london and ends in the stark gritty life of motherhood infidelity and attempted murder in wales the treatment of ptsd is well done and should speak to an american audience some day see ending br br each star has a great moment miller when she is yanking out stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child knightley and murpy when he finally bonds with his son oh hell almost all their scenes are awesome and rhys when he himself on the stand to get vera's husband sent to jail br br yet the real star of the movie is jonathan freeman's cinematography and john direction they seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical thomas is this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time and they cherish their scenes with stunning shots while this isn't best picture material it is a very good movie much more engaging than the dutchess it has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of thomas' poetry also this is clearly knightley's second best performance of her career and perhaps miller's best br br i have always had a weakness for the artist in struggle whether it's hulce's mozart or hoffman's capote but i was stunned at how little sympathy i felt for dylan thomas his struggles with alcohol are well known but his antagonism of william and caitlin to gain possession of his first love vera makes him out to be a bad man br br so is this academy award worthy clearly no at least not this year it will be released state side in march 2009 making it for the academies this is 9 months after it was released in britain between atonement miss and brideshead revisited the us has had its fill of ww2 british period pieces too bad this film is better then the other ones except atonement but in this one knightley's soldier does come back but as a shell of the man who left her
<START> the fact that this movie is bargain basement quality is a real shame but back in the 1940s that was about the only type of film made for theaters catering to black audiences due to segregation so while mgm warner and all the other big studios were making extremely polished films tiny studios with shoestring budgets were left to muddle by with what they had and from seeing this movie it's obvious that a lot of energy went into making the film even if it is a pretty lousy film aesthetically speaking some of the actors weren't particularly good especially the french guy the sets were minimal and the plot totally silly but the film also had some good music of varying styles from classical to jazz to rhythm and blues this is thanks to many talented but pretty much unrecognized black performers br br now as for the plot it was totally stupid and silly but still watchable in a kitschy way i loved seeing tim moore from the amos 'n andy tv show in drag as he made the absolute ugliest woman in cinema history this includes the bride of frankenstein and many others this is probably due to the fact that when not in drag he was a pretty ugly but funny guy if the man pretending to be a woman actually looked remotely like a woman i doubt this movie would have worked as well seeing this ugly and rubber faced man with a cheesy wig still being ardently sought after by three suitors was pretty funny br br this isn't a great film but from a historical point of view it's fascinating and excellent viewing for young adults to know what america was like for blacks in this era a very interesting and funny time capsule
<START> i saw this movie in 1956 and again on cable a few days ago the movie hasn't improved with age quite the opposite it's a true spaghetti epic br br the trojans are heroic and likable the greeks are nasty petty and sneaky br br so what if paris ran off with the king's wife hey love is love
<START> rachel and chuck valerie harper gerald mcraney decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family so they packed up their reluctant son gregory and daughter tammy lauren and moved back to a lake like the one rachel lived at as a child br br they say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a mayberry feel later the residence seems to be more like the people in deliverance soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces this does not keep the family from enjoying running around and messing around in the woods br br we find that they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get ax as the antagonists br br can the ignored young stevie save his parents or will their pursuer s put his her foot in it br br this film is more than most parodies as it was played with strait faces they could not have chosen better actors and daryl anderson was exceptionally creepy an added plus is that they let us know what is happening before the characters find out instead of pulling a clue out of the hat after the fact anyway this made for tv movie is good for a few laughs
<START> new yorkers contemporaneous with this film will recall how reflective of its time it is and how well cast and crew captured america new york city of that era br br norman wexler's script the different worlds the various sub live in and direction brings out phenomenal performances all around peter boyle's prodigious talent is on display as never before nor since clearly it is the best character portrayal the always likable dennis patrick ever accomplished br br what i will always remember about joe is the feeling of having been in a virtual state of shock coming out of the theater knowing that what the screen portrayed was seething under the surface in neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs of the city of new york br br this film needs to be remembered
