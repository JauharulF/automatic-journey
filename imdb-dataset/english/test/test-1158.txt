<START> i watched this film when i was a kid and i thought it was terrible then now that i'm older i found it just as terrible universal could have done better than this they merely decided to make the most money they could out of using all their monsters at once to me that was a cheap shot these characters were capable of holding their own in their own movies and the choice of actors was deplorable dracula needed to be bela lugosi frankenstein's monster needed to be karloff br br in my mind it was the disney squalid sequel sequence done decades ago and it was not appreciated started out with something great and original and then thought they could pander to the masses with the schlock which is extremely evident in this film
<START> this film is a fine example of why the shaw brothers are among the finest directors probably the best in the kung fu category the movie is well paced the story is excellent and intriguing and while the humor may not be in your face it is nested within the character interactions once the story builds up and the characters begin to assess the situation does the whole tower come crashing down in one of the best fight scenes tiger crane and crab hung gar are very present there is even a scene that mocks 18th century western social events and ends with clever and entertaining fighting the movie ends with a sudden cheesy moment but if you are a fan of the shaw brothers you'll understand that the cheese is just a topping and not the main course of the movie
<START> i lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up what possessed the filmmakers to do this this is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else to fill in a story without a point we get some stuff about the other folks in her thrall her aid to and of course her ten cats do not see this film and have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it they do not have a clue there are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and insights to share but marta is not one of them the people i took to this movie say they have forgiven me but that they will never ever stop kidding me about it
<START> obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre but i think this one is done quite well br br it's cute clever dark this story brought back memories of the types of girls i was in love with as a child br br also it makes me want to check out some of other movies many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video br br sure there is some burton influence here but i wouldn't say this brad is trying to rip him off br br he is just jumping in adding his talents to a genre that i can appreciate i like what he does he does it well nuff said
<START> this movie is worse than heaven's gate or plan 9 from outer space don't know why it got even one oscar it should have gotten a million raspberries just like the audiences that either walked out or didn't show up in the first place the hospital was a first rate financial failure but i'm certain the elite classes of left wing gutter mouthed intellectuals that the american public was far too to appreciate biting social commentary when they saw it and on and on george c scott in one of most artless and embarrassing roles along with aging sex symbol diana rigg spend most of the movie trying to cuss in an increasingly blasÃ© manner as they push along a silly plot poor old george is impotent and is just crushed by the event but after lots of dirty language between him and rigg he rapes her multiple times on lovely night in a filthy crumbling nyc hospital that looks so disgusting that i wouldn't want a dying pet rat treated in it there's also some sacrilegious junk dialog tossed about hither and yon laced with plenty of cussing as well it ends by portraying the faulty notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always brings on cardiac arrest never want to see another minute of this awful movie again
<START> a vampire prince falls for a human girl unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter that's the underlying theme of this martial arts romp which borrows ideas from underworld and buffy the vampire slayer but manages to maintain a style of its own i was bemused by the uk and hong kong title the twins effect as there are no twins involved in the story it turns out that the two main female characters are played by hong kong pop stars who perform as the twins don't let this put you off these girls can act at least well enough for this type of film and add a lot of charm to the proceedings jackie chan turns up for a couple of cameo appearances adding a dash of his own brand of slapstick mayhem to the proceedings all in all this is great fun for those who like their vampires served up with a helping of tongue in cheek humour
<START> i used to think that it couldn't get worse that army of the dead but this load of crap makes the afore mentioned movie look like the godfather the special effects are horrible makes the original nintendo graphics look like hdtv when it comes the acting put it this way i went to a play with my 6 year old niece in it and she gave an oscar worthy performance when compared to these d list and that's being kind about it actors and actresses so basically if i had a gun to my head and head to chose between watching this movie again or chopping my own arm off with a dull knife that's a tough choice you know what who needs two arms anyways
<START> i caught the north american premiere of this at the chicago international film festival i was beyond disappointed from the mood in the audience i wasn't the only one br br the film takes a long time to get to the conflict and then refuses to resolve it opting instead to tell us the story is to be continued is it a spoiler to reveal that a movie has no ending i consider it more of a warning this is at best only half a movie and not the good half
<START> my santa lucia choir was chosen to be in this movie all 100 plus when it came time to film the movie i was asked to chose just 10 oh my goodness we had a little gal who went early to have her tonsils out because she wanted to be in the movie the choices were hard to make the people of georgetown are just a lovely as the people that they show in the movie gracious kind believers the town sponsors an annual christmas market the first two weekend in december every year i was there this year and it was wonderful the town is lovely and the people work hard to make it magical the town appears today as it did when the movie was made much credit goes to the historical society there that work hard to maintain the historical value the principal of the school that has been turned into a charter school was given an award by the governor of colorado for volunteers
<START> this film had a distinct woody allen feel about it so if you're not a fan of dry humor dark humor or back handed humor you probably could find something else to do if you are however this is quirky with some nice twists and a flowing natural dialog br br the story itself is quite engaging not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot your eyes but close i mean that in the best way possible the intrigues are plenty the twists are enough to fully engage the senses and the characters are downright lovable br br i had a great time with this movie br br it rates an 8 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this movie is my all time favorite movie it has great acting cute guys and a great plot sean astin is great in this movie it has funny moments sad moments and happy moments who could ask for anything more this movie is great
<START> frankly i met real han su ying before and seeing her portrayed by an american actress which has no resemblance of anything chinese makes my head spin while i am watching this movie why can't hollywood get nancy kwan instead at least its more true to the story cos for goodness sake dr han su ying is chinese i know cos i have meet her in person br br and looking at the whole cast so few asian faces in a movie about a asian love story makes me wonder too br br i think the acting is good but without real asian faces in a asian love story makes the plot so corny and a whole load of baloney br br its just like another movie i know of ' the imagine my eyes pop out when i see john wayne as genghis khan br br and to make matter worst how on earth can a man born an bred in mongolian come up with a alabama southern accent and a cheap imitation of anything asian br br good grief br br i am not surprise that one day i will see dr martin luther king jr being played by one of the boys from the black and white minstrel show br br would love to see that br br and laugh the whole roof off br br cheers
<START> with old razor blades can i help it if i'm not cousin basil i think the piano's out of tune ginger grey this is your little laughs throughout the entire 20 minute short as the boys spoof gold diggers and opera singers they even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap wonder how many times they rehearsed the scene with the phone booth adding christine mcintyre and emil sitka 2 frequent collaborators to the mix makes it even better only vernon dent is missing the stooges did some great individual scenes but this was their best overall
<START> during ww2 in the japanese soldiers are starving dying growing weak and becoming more and more insane a small group of soldiers trying to stay alive have eventually resorted to cannibalism this film perfectly portrays the insanity that overtakes people under extreme conditions there are a few humorous parts in this movie but the majority of it is just a very slow moving and realistic film it follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another and eventually to death a very interesting film showing the death and the horror of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen
<START> when george sluizer was told he could direct an american version of the book het gouden the movie spoorloos outside holland this movie has the name the vanishing too he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed he was told that 'the american wouldn't approve the original ending of course the original ending is much better and without it the movie loses its impact because i have already put this in the trivia section i won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler free if you want to know the original ending watch spoorloos or read the book this movie is absolute rubbish and the first kiefer sutherland movie i don't like watch the original dutch movie which is one of the best thrillers in the world
