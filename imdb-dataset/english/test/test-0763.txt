<START> don't change your husband is another soap opera comedy from producer director cecil b de mille it is notable as the first of several films he made starring gloria swanson i guess you could also call it a sequel of sorts to his old wives for new 1918 br br james elliot dexter and leila swanson porter are a forty ish couple where james has gone to seed and become slovenly and lazy he has a penchant for smelly cigars and eating raw onions he takes his wife for granted leila tries to get him to straighten out to no avail br br one night at a dinner party at the porters leila meets the dashing van now there's a moniker the playboy nephew of socialite mrs sylvia ashton she invites leila to her home for the weekend to make james miss her once there begins to put the moves on her promising her pleasure wealth and love if she will leave her husband and go with him the sequences involving leila's imagining this promised new life are lavishly staged and forecast de mille's epic costume later in his career br br leila bored with her marriage and her disinterested husband divorces james and marries the playboy james ultimately realizes that he has lost the only thing that mattered to him and begins to mend his ways he shaves off his mustache works out shuns onions and re acquires some manners br br meanwhile all is not rosy with leila's new marriage it seems likes to gamble and has taken up with the gold digging nanette aka tootsie or some such name julia faye loses all of his money and steals leila's diamond ring to cover his losses br br one fateful day leila meets the new james and is taken by the changes in him james drives her home and becomes aware of her situation and br br this film marked the beginning of gloria rise to super stardom in a career that would rival that of mary pickford barely 20 years of age she had begun her career in mack sennett two reel comedies as a teen ager elliot dexter was almost 50 at this time but he and swanson make a good team although it's hard to imagine anyone tiring of the lovely miss swanson as is the case in this film br br dexter and sylvia ashton had appeared in the similar old wives for new where the wife had gone to seed and the husband was wronged br br also in the cast are de mille regulars theodore roberts as a bishop and raymond hatton as a gambler
<START> tonino il del aka the price of power is an excellent and enthralling spaghetti western that mirrors the kennedy assassination a great leading performance by giuliano gemma and an excellent score by luis are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie br br in 1881 texas is divided into those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and just want to live in peace and those who after 16 years still want to reinstall the confederacy in spite of warnings president james garfield who wants to establish a new policy of equality decides to visit dallas where corrupt law enforcement officials are planning his assassination bill giuliano gemma and two of his friends a black man named jack donovan ray and a crippled guy named nick manuel are determined to prevent the president's murder br br since james garfield was not assassinated by racists who wanted to reinstall the confederacy in texas but in washington dc by mentally unstable charles the storyline of price of power is of course historical nonsense since the movie however doesn't claim historical accuracy but tries to allude to the 1963 kennedy assassination in dallas the fact that the story is fictitious is legitimate br br giuliano gemma delivers an excellent performance as the main character bill benito is great as the villainous and corrupt sheriff jefferson some other good performances are those of ray as bill's black friend jack warren as arthur mcdonald the president's adviser and fernando rey as pinkerton a villainous rich businessman the score by luis is great the cinematography and locations are great and such as in earlier day of anger remind a lot of sergio leone for whom used to work as an assistant director for a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more br br all said il del is after day of anger another excellent spaghetti western that shows both the great talent of giuliano gemma as an actor and tonino as a director the price of power is a must see for spaghetti western fans and i also highly recommend it to everybody else 8 10
<START> this movie is the best movie i have seen in a long time it is also the best movie seen that uses a drama to tell history without going to speculation such as with jfk nixon or hoffa it deftly depicts the clutches that belgium had on the congo it also teases out easily for us the european and american forces that were behind the power the inflict the congo today the film was sure to specifically implicate the u s rightly so in the murder of this film could never be made in the u s for u s film rarely criticizes itself in acts of imperialism and murder save stone's jfk it also lets us in on the problems that were present with the inner conflict of the congo between and we can see how precarious countries sit in establishing new governments when their history is one of colonization and those who were the continue to pull the strings of power and force the film is excellently shot with an excellent the cast is great and they really draw you into the feeling of the climate in the congo during that time br br again this is a must see for those who love drama with a correct historical background see my notes on
<START> i saw a couple of days ago a nice story based on well known characters created by a a milne although winnie piglet and rabbit are all present in this animated feature the main character is roo this time he befriends with scary who proves to be not scary at all and shows everybody that friendship knows no boundaries and everybody wants and deserves to be happy i love this film and i would love it even more were i 10 or 15 years younger alas i would like to become a kid again to enjoy this story much more but all i am left with is a sense of sadness at the loss of a sort of childishness and innocence of which this movie is i was glad to hear carly simon sing joel provided great score
<START> haggard doesn't even need to be graded since it was never designed to be graded like oscar winning movies are and it was never intended to have won an oscar obviously if you just look at some of the stuff that bam and tried like the fast motion shots it comes across as a film thats something more than just or jackass even though those are cool too for pure enjoyability i definitely give this film a 10 almost every scene made me laugh until my sides hurt like trail movie if you haven't seen this see it and then buy it personally my favorite character is brandon falcone he's just so smooth and natural and random that its hilarious he great with the action figures and makes up the funniest stuff lol a diamond mountain bike haggard is definitely a movie that in overall humor is only rivaled by anchorman and napoleon dynamite

<START> based on the true story of the hunt for those who were responsible for the bombing of the world trade center building a very good film that delves into the use of informants and how possibly the tragedy could have been avoided 7 of 10
<START> caution spoilers br br although this film moved a bit slow at times the brilliant scenery richness of the characters and powerful themes make morte a a rewarding experience i have not read thomas mann's book but i am certain that visconti's visual splendour musical score and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice br br the study of gustav von alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and our emotions behaviour and passion this tendency is demonstrated in the scene in germany between alfred and gustav when alfred describes music as being both mathematical i e and emotional this conflict arises again in the scene where young is alone playing in lobby of the hotel and gustav recalls his visit to a bordello where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song in his flashback after paying the prostitute gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions this reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that represents br br ultimately gustav is forced to make his biggest decision stay in venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations or flee venice to save his own life his early attempt to flee venice at the train station resulted in a futility and foreshadows the outcome of prolonging his stay br br complimenting the captivating character interaction visconti's powerful scenery especially of venice at dawn and the final scene of walking into the water and pointing to the horizon renders this film a true masterpiece
<START> i gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10 it had an excellent plot and peter coyote and michele lee as well as the rest of the cast did their parts well br br both peter and michele were too long in the tooth for the ages their characters were supposed to be and their children in the film obviously would have been better suited being their grandchildren br br i missed the first ten minutes of this film so i don't know just how that body turned up after 25 years and got traced back to denny traynor peter character but i had no difficulty picking up on the storyline br br barbara traynor michele lee is stunned when her long time husband denny is arrested for a murder in oregon some 25 years previous a state denny claims he was never in br br however as evidence piles up against denny his story changes then his story changes again and yet again until barbara doesn't know what to believe br br barbara makes up her mind however to get to the bottom of the mystery whirling around the fateful time denny and a young girl named sherry accepted a ride from a stranger named wayne kennedy that ended in murder br br i found the film entertaining well paced and it kept me guessing as to what had really happened between those three people br br from what i saw during the closing credits this seemed to be based on a true story
<START> i saw this movie on television as and loved it i heard an interesting story about this film when roger corman released it to drive ins in the summer of 1981 his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film it was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster during the film's opening at drive in's irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see theater owners called corman and said their customers felt ripped off so corman had to run off copies of the footage and send the positive film to theater owners to splice into the film themselves since the footage was never part of the film negative it has not appeared in any video dvd or television broadcast has anyone ever seen this footage anyone who saw this film at a drive in in the summer of 1981 remember this
<START> while it's generally acknowledged one of the first martial arts movies to play here in the west it's real impact comes in retrospect lo lieh is very low key throughout and many of the fight scenes while often hailed as innovative which they were at the time of the movie's initial release are a tad tame compared to what came after particularly after bruce lee who became the instant standard by which all others will forevermore be judged that's not to say that five fingers of death king boxer is anything less than a classic in its own right because it is like many of the leading characters in many martial arts movies the character lieh plays lays low through most of the movie for a reason but when he cuts loose he effectively cleans house you can't ask for more than that
<START> i would like to know if the outsiders australian tv series will ever be released on dvd sometime in the future and is the music title theme available on cd br br there was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total br br the young german actor in the series was also in a german tv series called black forest clinic which aired here in the uk with english dialogue superimposed with the lip sync br br i look forward to hearing any comments from tv industry personnel on the above questions thank you in advance
<START> darr is a great movie shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her i have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy like the threatening phone calls never in my life will i forget the line i love you k k k kiran br br it's just too bad that shahrukh and juhi weren't exactly together in the film but juhi and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie though shahrukh's role was pretty psychotic i still think he did a great job of playing it and can't possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no wonder he got an award for darr in br br juhi what can i say she looks especially amazing in this film it's not that she doesn't always look amazing in her other films but darr did give the public a wonderful image of her br br as for the music it was excellent especially teri one of my all time favorite songs i also thought tu mere was quite nice also br br a must see for everyone overall darr deserves a 9 10
<START> i enjoyed ramin man push cart and this film is equally good this slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived br br alejandro and gonzales do an excellent job as a 12 year old brother and a 16 year old sister who live in a small room over an auto shop there are no parents they are on their own surviving ali supplements his income by stealing auto parts selling bootleg dvds and selling candy on the subway supplements her income working a food truck by selling herself they are trying to make money to but their own truck br br one is tempted to express outrage at the fact that these two children are left to fend on their own and certainly one can be very upset that sells her body to willing truckers but the fact is that this exists today in the world's richest country not some underdeveloped land save the outrage and do something
