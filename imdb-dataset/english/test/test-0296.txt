<START> latter days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre most of the films entail sappy stories one night stands and let us not forget infamous baseball teams latter days actually contains male affection beyond the kiss in the dark and quite graphic material that made me wonder whether the film belonged at blockbuster or com the films emotional journey is what sets it above the rest in the genre not until this film had i seen a story of such intense passion and love and the torture that it can bring i think when people cry during movies they should be beaten but i found myself sobbing throughout several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live i suggest every gay male see this film and if you have a boyfriend thank him
<START> i would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie if at one point or another you thought you've seen good camera work be prepared to be amazed by this movie for the record this movie was made in 1957 in russia but the technique used here is probably something that we've seen much later in the western world about 20 years later the level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot happiness love war despair joy but in the end you remain with something quite unique the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking the young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similar even though i think movies like this are very hard to come by if you've seen i am cuba then this movie would appeal to you very much but if not be prepared for a unique experience the russian directors have something in common very small budgets great actors and a joy of creating art and yes they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together i am not a big fan of russia actually i hate everything that's communist but the film making in that part of the world manages to create such feelings that are hard to describe br br enjoy it br br
<START> could easily have been better in fact maybe so much so that if the filmmaker hadn't tried even as hard as he did it might have actually been better br br on a good note the lighting was reasonably okay but pretty much everything else was lacking wobbly camera work yeah yeah i know that's supposed to be the style now poorly recorded audio and editing that looked like someone watched too many ulli lommel movies which are some of the worst edited movies to sum it up the movie seemed to be a rationalization for the director writer main character to get some young women naked put them in fake bondage and grope them while saying menacing things
<START> black dragons 1942 william nigh bela lugosi joan barclay clayton moore br br just prior to the start of world war ii dr bela lugosi a world famous surgeon is brought in by japan's black dragon society as part of a secret plan dr operates on six black dragon society operatives and transforms them into exact duplicates of 6 high ranking american businessmen who are replaced by these look with their operatives in place the black dragon society's plan to sabotage the american war effort appears to be set but the f b i chief and an agent begin to piece together the clues that hopefully uncover this sinister plot according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br that synopsis gives away the entire ending which in this case might be a good thing black dragons is an incredible wildly inconsistent muddle a wiser course of action would have been to stay with the teasing supernatural angle in early scenes mr lugosi as monsieur colomb is effectively creepy confusing joan barclay as alice saunders future lone ranger clayton moore as dick martin along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that looks as if filmmakers were making it up as they went along
<START> when i sat down to watch greek for the first time i wasn't expecting a show with complex characters intriguing plot lines and impeccable writing but that's exactly what i got br br greek follows several college students who are in the greek system at rhodes university rusty cartwright enters rhodes as a polymer science major who aspires to be in a fraternity his older sister casey the show's center and soon to be president of zeta beta zeta the most prestigious sorority on campus isn't exactly supportive of his plans in fact none of her friends even knew she had a brother until he set foot on the college grounds on top of dealing with the fact that her dorky younger brother has been forced back into her life casey's boyfriend evan chambers soon to be president of the fraternity on campus omega chi is cheating on her with a new pledge rebecca logan diabolical president frannie is pressuring her to stay with him and she still has feelings for her slacker ex boyfriend president of the party house on campus kappa tau these characters are joined by calvin owens an athletic intelligent friend of who happens to be gay dale die hard christian and possibly racist roommate and best friend and ashleigh casey's quirky best friend and confidante br br throughout two seasons or four chapters viewers are often reminded that college life is not black and white but in shades of gray from here on out every character makes their fair share of mistakes but every one of them has redeemable qualities casey and have a complicated but beautiful relationship throughout the series rusty dale and calvin's friendship is not always perfect but they manage to survive every obstacle that is thrown at them even frannie rebecca and evan the show's villains are shown as human every once in a while br br greek shows college students at their best worst and in between it is a show that reveals college as what it truly is a four year adventure where one's morals beliefs and willpower are tested compromised and sometimes even changed br br greek has at least one season left if not more before it ends i cannot wait to see where the characters end up next greek is not your typical abc family sitcom if you want to tune in to a show that shows the truth behind human motivation greek is the show for you
<START> firstly this movie works in the fact that it is disturbing i really did not like seeing all these scenes where people get cut up alive etc the weirdly erotic introduction gives one a sense of wonder it is somewhat to me personally but the movie really works in that respect and it is to be scary so i give it credit for that yup a few points there for those scalpels and well damned disturbing idea of getting alive br br but what this movie lacks is an interesting plot characterization or real surprises the whole teen flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple predictable way lots of moments creepy guys who are insane and the big question of all is the boyfriend the murderer this movie fits into the category of scream and countless others which have spawned over the 90s well i won't spoil it for you but it's not exactly interesting who is the killer we find out who it is half way through and from there on the movie on trying to fill in some time rather boringly to say the least i was looking at the clock a bit on this movie br br the lead actress is great as usual but the acting box she is placed into makes one groan in pain the college girl who is a detective who everyone thinks is insane but she is the one who really knows whats going on and the cops ahhh they just laugh and eat donuts very predictable flat disturbing at times and most of all boring and dull it's like an american film company took a flight to germany to shoot a movie to make it foreign hmmm or did they br br
<START> this movie is a cyborg in and of itself half nonsense half lifetime original movie br br as a cyborg this movie has but one objective to make you wish that you had spent the duration of the film in a dark room punching yourself in the testicles br br unlike many people i did not rent this movie because of angelina jolie i'll explain why i rented it shortly i am not a big fan of ms jolie's though i will say that her performance was stellar her blank stare and robotic acting really did have me believing that she was an android hooker if anyone has a clip of her on 'inside the actor's explaining how she prepared for this role please send it my way i'll make sure to use it when i try james lipton for crimes against integrity br br so what drove me to rent this movie one would think that it was the hope of seeing angelina jolie's nipples but it wasn't no the reason behind this rental rested solely on one of the images on the cover of the dvd that of jack palance's face half of his face was robotic when i saw that i imagined legions of slowly marching through a fiery wasteland laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist in my mind's eye every member of this unholy army of had a red glowing eye a red glowing eye that looked at humans and saw only meat they were to be the architects of oblivion a cold steely apocalypse a nightmare from which humanity would never awaken it's a beautiful image that i will cherish till the end of my years br br like most things in my life the actual movie did not live up to my expectations no there was only jack palance and the only visible enhancements that he had were located on his legs sadly those enhancements didn't really enhance anything that is unless you count walking like a victim as a super power at least their was a scene where jack grinning like a trigger happy alzheimer's patient got to shoot the hell out of some people i was waiting for him to yell i'm damn tired of paying too much for prescription medication unfortunately any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far between br br what the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a man elias koteas a k a poor man's de niro and a cyborg angelina jolie a k a demon spawn of john voigt oh man can the love between a romeo of flesh and a juliet of silicon ever be able to last it can if you follow jack palance's simple advice you have to taste each other's time br br yeah i'm not sure what that means however i am sure that i do not want jack palance to be the one to explain it to me i sure as heck don't want him to show me as an experiment i suggest that you ask your significant other if he she thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to taste each other's time
<START> lang does hawks as well as hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary western before settling down into typical deterministic dark and guilt haunted lang for the finale br br this is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly vance shaw randolph scott is on horseback and being pursued we know not why he stumbles on wounded edward dean jagger and decides to take his gun and horse but discovering that is in a bad way decides to fix him up first this is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief clipped dialog in 2 minutes we know that shaw is an outlaw but basically a good guy shaw ends up helping on his way to civilization then disappears br br cut to a few weeks or months later with on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from omaha he hires shaw as a scout who tries to leave when he finds out that is in charge but wants him anyway a debt and sensing something quality also hired is a tenderfoot son of a benefactor of the project but atypically the richard blake robert young is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting bronco busting sequence both of the hires vie for sister sue virginia gilmore who again not typically seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man the camaraderie between the three men the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of howard hawks' red river or only angels have wings than most lang but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter and doesn't alter our pleasure if it does perhaps change our expectations as the more usual themes of the haunted past dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film shaw's old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move attacks mount on the crew and shaw has to wrestle with what if anything he is to tell about his tortured relationship with jack slade barton leader of the outlaws br br beautifully shot in early technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations this is for my money easily lang's best western and one of his very best films conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future scott is as good as i've seen him showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine the inevitable showdown between shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary and a surprise even for a longtime lang devotee such as myself and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside you can get a shave you can feel like a new man but you can't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back br br genius
<START> terrible below par not bad good brilliant br br warning minor spoilers br br homosexuality these day's is hardly the taboo subject it was over forty years ago however it must be said that perhaps more so in america than say over here in the u k it can still be a touchy subject just look at the whole debacle of in the some years ago in the us it's with 'in and out' that writer paul taps in to the small town mentality of middle america and the way the press in the us as well as in the uk make such a big deal in outing a celebrity you need only look at when will young and stephen of came out of the closet br br the movie centres on howard brackett kevin kline a high school english teacher in his home town the local people are preparing themselves for oscar night as one of the nominees cameron drake matt dillon came from their town and was a former pupil of cameron who plays a gay soldier in a vietnam epic wins the award only to out howard as being gay during his acceptance speech this could not come at a worse time for howard who is just day's away from marrying his fiance and fellow school teacher emily joan cusack as you would expect the media reaction is cataclysmic and turn's life upside down not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay but evade sleazy news reporter peter malloy tom selleck br br although this was billed as a screwball comedy it's clear that and director frank oz are also attempting to be satirical you only have to look at the early scenes at the oscars and the way the people of home town as well as the teaching board of the school react to his outing br br sadly the film doesn't live up to the promise we see early on in the movie this is a pretty flat attempt to make social commentary out of a wacky comedy a good cast is sadly wasted on a script that never really delivers the amount of laughs and is no where near as insightful as it thinks it br br kline gives us the same kind of endearing performance that he gave us in his earlier comedy making howard an instantly likeable character cusack too is good value as howard's weight obsessed fiance while tom selleck play's very well against type as a gay news reporter bob newhart is a joy also as the principal of the high school where howard works it's great to see him on the big screen for a change it's a shame that it had to be this br br the performances as good as they are can do little to rescue the movie from being a rather dull affair while a couple of scenes do offer some amusement namely the inspired scene where howard attempts to make himself seem more manly by listening to a self help tape there is little to enjoy and when things can't seem to get any worse resorts to a sickening finale that lurches in to over the top sentiment i also couldn't help but feel that my intelligence was being insulted malloy appears to be too sleazy a character to become the man who put's his ethics before getting a good story while finally come to the rescue in the film's climax seems at first to be too self involved a character to care a jot about what happens to his former teacher after all it's he who caused all the trouble in the first place br br 'in and out' isn't exactly dire but when you consider the likes of better work like 'a fish called you can't help but feel that here is a great talent being sadly wasted br br robs rating
<START> holy sweet murder this is quite possibly the least funny movie i've ever seen you can take my word for this as truth because it's playing on television right now it's really one of the most pathetic productions i've ever seen there is not a single redeemable aspect of this flick it just lacks any humor whatsoever the only good thing it possibly has going for it is that it's so unfunny that it's wholly unmemorable in fact i just sat through some ridiculous sub plot and i can't really tell you what went on the only reason i can even possibly remember having seen this movie is because it's so absolutely humorless it will stick in my mind forever based on that alone br br an absolutely must miss if your friend wants to show it to you shoot him and save yourself the boredom
<START> barnyard sucked i saw this movie last week and it is horrible what bull has my 2 year old was asking me if all cows have and trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the movie only confused her more br br in addition the violent theme scared my 2 year old they made the coyotes ferocious looking and this has instilled a fear of coyotes into my daughter i know coyotes for a fact are not ferocious and are natural predators the mother and son who were sitting in front of us were shouting kill him kill him yea in a particular scene in the movie where good vs evil per say br br it is a lion king rip off and they should stop using big name actors for a lame movie steve who has also done thumb movies such as thumb wars and many others are so so bad br br if a good steve movie ever comes out in my lifetime i will roll over naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on youtube com enough said
<START> oh well its funny should have been a sadistic comedy a lot of horror movies lack common sense but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation don't really expect hitchcock or anything close to this this is a good one for friends but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie the suspense the shock and good characters the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be and he seemed to be the average angry d student able to outsmart only stupid people and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called victims br br 3 10 just expect this one in the daily
<START> the first thing i noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up a quality movie all round br br i suppose you could love this film just for its action but i liked it for more than that br br this is a pure thriller horror movie it offers a more fully fleshed script than most horror films do i thought at least the u s version ended brilliantly and was great throughout the story felt honest and brutal br br the film has an excellent tight script that keeps the action moving with believable characters in largely believable situations
<START> i happen to have read all of english released manga i watched the tomie film and it was a big steaming pile of turd thankfully actually does justice to the manga i think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this film more as many screenshots and camera angles are exactly like in the manga and it is interesting to see how the book characters are played in the film this film reminds me of eerie indiana the ending differs to the manga which i was expecting looks like her manga counterpart and her male friend suits the whole very well very creepy i have to admit this film feels like a feverish nightmare the kind you have when you were a kid not really scary at all but freaky if you get my drift another great horror from japan get yourself a copy
<START> watching this on comcast on demand br br every time i see this musical i am amazed at the songs one show stopper after another br br this interpretation is for me magical the songs sparkle the vocals orchestrations and choreography are amazing for a made for tv movie better than many stage versions i have seen br br the debate over bette just doesn't make sense she is her voice is brilliant and yet full of the pathos of the stage mother living through her daughters i still get tears at the end when she finally has her moment of glory no matter how faded that glory is br br the tulsa louise duet dance is on now fabulous br br stephen sondheim is the king of musical theatre his lyrics just roll off the tongue like silk music is perhaps the best ever penned for the stage screen br br thank god we have this masterpiece of the american musical theatre captured on dvd
