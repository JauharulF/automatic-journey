<START> oh good grief br br i saw this movie title in the tv schedules and thought i must watch this movie ripping off snakes on a plane it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too sounds fantastically bad well i was half right br br this movie is eye meltingly bad and sadly not even unintentionally hilarious it's just bad even worse it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action for the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language mexican or spanish apologies for my ignorance and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on then we have to endure even more terrible acting and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak english anyway as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculous br br low budget does not always mean bad but in this case it does what we have here is a movie given no thought a terrible script a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on it's very few strengths i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous avoid if you can br br see this if you like the wicker man remake terrible cgi
<START> best in show is certainly christopher guest's funniest and deepest movie yet the characters are excellently portrayed and the connection of pet to owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie i've been a fan of guest since spinal tap but in this movie he has truly achieved what he set out to do in the mock a genre he invented and has now perfected
<START> br br as i am a teenager i have about one hundred years of movies to catch up on i try to see a mixture of classics mainstream art house and other movies the 70's is one of the most important decades for films it's when the average common classical films changed into full of messages and anti social behavior it became like nothing anyone had ever seen before what a decade under the influence basically shows is how important all of the movies from around the graduate to about star wars br br richard lagravenese and the late ted demme are the primary in this documentary which interviews such people as dennis hopper francis ford coppola martin scorsese robert altman and jon voight among others about how those few years changed cinema forever it's a very professional polished documentary and it's even financed by ifc films however as this is a very professional one i would think that they would at least edit out the noise of someone behind the camera laughing to me that took out a lot of how neat and clean the whole thing was br br on the other hand it's a very interesting documentary about film by the people who make it of course they aren't bashing their own films or anything of the like but they're portraying honesty on what they thought of the films and what they meant i don't know much about film but i want to be involved around it when i become an adult so i feel like to someone like me this movie is a huge asset i have seen a good number of movies that they mentioned like chinatown and one flew over the cuckoo's nest but a little more insight into those movies were very informative br br the main reason however i didn't love influence is as slickly as it was edited it seemed to take its time in the beginning and be quite relaxed therefore not having enough time to get to everything that they wanted to show they crammed in star wars and jaws in the last few minutes when they were two of the most important it seemed like they tried too hard to show lots of clips and that's fine but some of them were unimportant such as an extended one from network br br overall though influence is a very enthralling informative documentary that helped me at least learn more about a second golden age' in american cinema br br my rating 7 10 br br rated r for language and images of sexuality violence and drug use
<START> my jaw fell so many times watching this flick i have bruises okay granted i really wasn't expecting the quality of say the others or even thirteen ghosts the new one which was just dreadful and is still head and shoulders above this insanity someone else noted the thin characters i wouldn't call them thin thin implies there might be something to them how about almost non existent in no particular order we have the girl who will scream the american who will figure it all out the macho guy who will just bull through everything until he gets killed the wise black man who will die early the extra guy who is there to die first the extra woman who is there to play tough that's it that's your character list and that is what they are and what they remain from beginning to end if they were thin they might at least change a little bit from beginning to end but they don't well okay the american guy decides he's going to stay with the at the end and the screaming girl goes back to wherever she came from that's the change other than that they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely betray any real emotion when they finally meet up with the menace br br now the producers get props for an original menace i will say i had understood the story was going to be tremors but with ants instead of giant worms i give the writer credit these are very cool very scary ants and what they do with bones is excellent the first time the bone snatcher appear i admit i jumped a few feet unfortunately the very cool concept becomes alien in the desert very quickly we get a lot of commentary on ants that may or may not be true but we don't get much of the mythology on which the menace is based and we get every monster movie clichÃ© ever made people go into places they know they shouldn't and when they have no compelling reason to moronic characters try to hinder our heroes and die for it one character does double duty as scientist who doesn't want to kill the monster but study it a very cool gadget is introduced only so the american can tell everyone something about ants that gee i hope everyone knows anyway then the gadget is broken our heroes run out of the one thing that can keep the menace at bay and then there is that final annoying moment when we know the menace is still with us and wonder exactly what and how the hey the hero or heroine came by it it completely renders everything that went before as useless and false br br three stars for the cool use of ants and bones nothing at all for clichÃ©s clunky dialogue and dim bulb characters
<START> goldie hawn in 1969 was best known for playing in television comedy shows in particular rowan and martin's laugh in where she was the giggly cookie young blond she did make movies before cactus flower the most notable being a walt disney feature the one and only genuine original family band but cactus flower picked up on her character from laugh in and due to a good script by i a l diamond billy wilder's second partner based on an abe burrows play she was able to develop the television character so that a real performance was fleshed out as a result ms hawn won an oscar for best supporting actress in 1969 and her career took off to such future hits as private benjamin and the first wives club although other stars of laugh in did well on television henry gibson has a recurring role as a judge on boston legal only goldie was able to have a career as a movie star br br on laugh in goldie's personality would show a naivetÃ© that would be embarrassing occasionally she realized it and would laugh loud to cover but sometimes she just did not see her error example goldie is introduced to the 1950s variety show host gary moore and is told goldie this is mr gary moore she shakes his hand and says much to his confusion i've always wanted to meet mr john gary moore but as toni simmons it is quite different she is desperately in love with dr julian winston walter matthau a successful dentist who can never marry her julian has told her that his wife with whom he has had two sons and a daughter will never give him a divorce so at the start of the film toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her stove but she is rescued by her neighbor igor sullivan rick lenz a struggling dramatist who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas br br toni is resigned to live but she has sent a suicide note to julian igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note but julian's receptionist nurse assistant stephanie dickinson ingrid bergman won't stop julian's work schedule to pass him the phone when igor calls instead julian finds the letter and races to apartment only to find her alive when igor supports her story that she tried to kill herself julian realizes the depth of her love and decides he must marry such a woman unfortunately toni has swallowed julian's lies and believes in his wife and children you see julian has no wife and children since toni is a firm believer that she can't marry a man who would lie to her julian is stuck on a weakening tree branch br br julian comes to solve it by getting stephanie to pretend she is mrs winston stephanie is opposed to it at first but on her own on her first free saturday she confronts toni at the record shop toni is at they talk and toni notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of stephanie and since stephanie has her two nephews with her toni thinks they are julian's kids toni tells julian they have to see who is the man that stephanie is supposedly going to marry so the lie starts spiraling for julian stephanie and toni soon a lover is given to stephanie in the form of julian's friend and patient harvey greenfield jack weston greenfield is so sleazy stephanie loathes him that toni feels that he is unworthy of stephanie br br and so it goes with one complication most caused by the well intentioned toni following another until the conclusion the script is full of first rate situations and one liners example julian to reward stephanie for lying about their marriage buys two record albums from store he has given a mink stole to toni but she decides to send it to stephanie with julian's card stephanie is quite happy at getting the mink but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she got when she profusely thanks matthau he says the thought she'd like horowitz meaning horowitz but stephanie thinks horowitz is the name of the furrier br br bergman must have enjoyed the filming as several scenes shows that earthy radiance that was a trademark for her in the later 1940s films but there was also the resemblance to her 1958 film comedy smash hit indiscreet there cary grant lied to make sure the pair would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage when grant's lie is revealed to bergman she decides on a lie of her own to convince grant that she was making him a cuckold here instead of being the passive lover believing matthau is telling the truth bergman gingerly tries to get matthau out of his mess by little white lies only to find one leads to another to complicate everyone's lives bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem despite trying to be part of the solution br br all the leads perform well in particular bergman all business at first but gradually reclaiming her sexuality matthau is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that just can't be kicked aside the supporting cast especially weston as the mooching and sexually slimy harvey and vito as the u n ambassador who actually has the hots for bergman it was a clever comedy and a really good way for goldie hawn's movie career to push forward
<START> no one would ever question that director leos carax is a genius but what we wonder about is is he an insane genius so many people hated this film i am normally the first person to accuse many french directors of making offensive boring disgusting and pretentious films such as the horrible recent film and the pointless and offensive rouges' but strangely enough i actually think that x' is an amazing film made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft and containing remarkable performances the film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than i believe i have ever seen on screen before but then carax is extreme that we know the film also contains what i consider way over the top or anarchist fantasies and wet dreams what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie in between playing scott walker's rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels guillaume depardieu plays a rich young man in a chÃ¢teau whose step mother is catherine deneuve and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath by the way but he suddenly completely when he discovers that his deceased father a famous diplomat had fathered an illegitimate daughter who had been effectively disposed of by deneuve as an inconvenience this is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of romanian refugee with wild dishevelled hair expressionless face and little ability to speak french coherently depardieu then transforms himself into a hero' of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption and lives in squalor and extreme poverty while scorning a vast inheritance he then commences an incestuous sexual relationship with his half sister which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people though i have no objection to it as i think people are far too hysterical about sex especially in america where apparently it never happens the intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful if depressing hyper melodrama the differences between carax making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme french films which i think are pretentious and disgusting are 1 that carax is an excellent filmmaker and 2 he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful if harrowing extreme emotional condition whereby a human being disintegrates and turns against his background many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous but i don't agree i believe carax was genuine and was not making an exploitation picture at all it is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who for all i know may be a complete madman but i believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement
<START> this is said to be the first polish western and is written and directed by piotr known in the u s as dead man's bounty this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialog val kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way my favorite is a young man building a gallows chops off one of his own fingers and actually hangs himself testing the strength of the rope a cowboy known only as 'the stranger' karel roden finds a dead man kilmer that he thinks is a wanted man he takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty he ends up losing the corpse and the potential bounty in a gambling game with the town's drunken sheriff linda and has the few townsmen turned against him when he has a dalliance with the barmaid he manages to escape sure death and leads the small posse on a dangerous 'wild goose one scene has the stranger tending to a scalp wound by with gunpowder and a match the corpse rots chained to a hitching post as the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had this movie also known as summer love has a haunting theme song sung by john davidson nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck there is just something that tells you not to look but you do
<START> the original assault on precinct 13 is gritty witty and perhaps most importantly short this remake is mercilessly padded out and talky worse yet the african american hero of the first movie is here replaced with handsome white boy ethan hawke which makes this assault less progressive than the 1970s one god how i miss john carpenter and his improbable plot line and his weird sense of humor i even miss his b list actors who are leagues better than hawke and company br br i can't say i care for the new villains in this version they stretch what little credibility the story ever had to the limit the female characters are useless the criminals are all generic hoods and gabriel byrne gives another of his bored performances the music's all wrong too it's bland action stuff that actually detracts from the tension simply awful
<START> think you've seen the worst movie in the world think again the person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising the cover makes it look like a good scary horror suspense thriller but no what we have instead is a movie that makes a noise every time a credit flashes across the screen the biggest name in the entire film is probably casper van dien who hardly has a part br br i voted a one for this one only because i couldn't vote any lower if i could vote something like negative five thousand trust me i would have so for now i'm going to give 1 2 out of 5 just because it ended
<START> what a shame this could have been good the main problems are the script and the star the film cannot decide whether to be a slapstick comedy of a very uninspired and routine kind or whether to be a insightful satire on the old east germany and its mores its attempts at the latter flop totally however the film does not hold together well and the ending is very artificial and unbelievable any stereotypes one might have about german comedy are sadly reinforced br br the characters are stereotypes one and all and the leading character played by kim frank is colourless in the extreme he just cannot carry the film and appears to have been chosen largely for his baby face it may not be all the actor's fault he is a pop singer as the script does not give him much to work on br br one plus the recreation of the east german 'style' and period is good br br the worst thing is that the film feels somehow dishonest and demeaning the film seems to have been churned out by people who were not necessarily giving it their best and just wanted to make a quick buck from a few cheap laughs if they were giving it their best it is a sad case indeed i watched it at the cinema with an east german audience and i felt sorry for them the regime was awful in almost all respects but those who lived through it deserve better than this
<START> read a biography of the late george c scott and you'll discover why he was so enormously talent he was asked by an interviewer what his secret was when making each character he played his own scott replied he possessed inside him a burning fire which drove him in one of his last he sadly revealed he had lost the drive this was not the case when he starred in the movie the hospital in this offering he plays talented doctor medical director of one of the finest hospitals in the country however life has dealt him some crippling problems such as losing his wife to a divorce becoming alienated from both his promising children and worse of all believing himself to be physically impotent at this point he is now becoming complacent morose and frequently fantasizes various ways of committing suicide to add to his growing list of personal obstacles his main reason for being his hospital has come under siege by students and neighborhood protesters incompetent doctors like dr richard and a mysterious md who is killing both patients and doctors alike because he believes he is the wrath of the lamb barnard hughes few choices are left to one is promising doctor brubaker robert walden whom he confides in by saying if there were an oven around here i would put my head in it the second is a luscious young woman named barbara who is attracted to because he acts like a wounded bear paddy wrote the screen play and arthur hiller did an extremely good job of directing this dramatically interesting dark story but a vehicle nonetheless lit by the fire of george c scott
<START> the movie plot seems to have been constructed from a disjointed dream there is not enough realism to hold the viewer's interest the vermont farm scene was a failed opportunity to show the way farms were set up and farm families lived which would have been interesting and entertaining there was little if no research into the whiskey bootlegging trade of the period the costumes of the canadians looked like something from the french revolution totally unbelievable the fiddle playing was good and of the time period but chris's motions while supposedly playing were unbelievable the owl's appearance was a never explained mystery and the train disappearing into thin air was too much i couldn't understand how a live trout got frozen into the ice and why two men in the wilderness without food would release the trout a good food source
<START> as horror films go rest stop could have been better in many levels director writer john shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it unfortunately either he was not sure as to what to do with the material or maybe he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended either by the studio or the backers several endings have been included in the dvd but unfortunately the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best br br the idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of california presents many possibilities at first after the disappearance of jess in the spooky rest stop things get out of hand poor nicole is left alone to fend for herself all the weirdos she finds along the way br br it was clear when one started to hear amazing grace in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the ways in which nicole an jess their neck of the woods by engaging in careless sex that is not well appreciated by the natives br br watch it at your own risk there's a lot of gore for the aficionados of the genre
<START> hey i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so much perhaps i missed the point the way i see it a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with and have informed excited shocked evoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and think while it is true that sen's endeavor was an ambitious one in light of all the other movies this one falls short miserably it was too slow there were no details about anything and the ending was completely pointless it was not open ended or anything just pointless so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted
<START> i grew up watching sitcoms such as seinfeld roseanne simpsons etc etc in other words mainstream television over the years many sitcoms have come on the air and of those a very small percentage are smart and funny the war at home is a prime example of the majority of modern american comedy br br i give the show a 3 out of 10 because it is what it aims to be a comedy but it doesn't seem to go out of its way to be a good comedy a good comedy should have you swept off your feet with its big jokes you shouldn't be able to see them coming and in i see just about every joke coming the characters are probably the most simplistic and horrible stereotypes i have seen yet on screen and the acting isn't very good save for the father who portrays a stereotypical beer drinking sport loving american idiot perfectly br br poor acting unbelievable characters and jokes that don't catch you off guard detract from this show to a point of where it is unwatchable if you don't have cable and would like to see a comedy worth watching try boston legal it is more worth your time
