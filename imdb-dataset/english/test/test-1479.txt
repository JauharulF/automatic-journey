<START> i watched this film because i thought it would be a classic amy adams movie wow this movie is so bad on so many levels it staggers the imagination it is poorly constructed for one also the script and the acting is just awful but hey even johnny depp has a slew of bad films under his belt the upside of this movie would be amy singing and even on that score i believe better songs could have been chosen amy is of course beautiful to see and if you are a die hard fan of hers you will probably watch this title no matter what just don't expect too much i wish i could have found more to like but it was just painful to watch i recommend sunshine cleaning or doubt
<START> i have waited a long time to see this movie ifc finally ran it one night i thought it would be something like barfly from barbet schroeder wrong this film doesn't recreate that underworld of chintzy dirty smoke filled character filled bars you associate with his stories it also fails to capture that bukowski attitude that mickey rourke did so well in the above mentioned film that natural smart ass attitude fans of charles bukowski will enjoy seeing scenes from his books on screen but those unfamiliar with his books could get the wrong impression about his works this film looks like just another 'movie of the week about a drunk and his relationships if you want to get a better idea about charles bukowski's world watch barfly
<START> greta garbo stars in a very early 1930 mgm the first time talks' is a powerful movie but not for everyone the movie is filmed like a stage play short on sets and cinematography long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations eugene o'neil who wrote the play is known for his dark work and garbo's character anna christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past br br the sound quality on the dvd was mediocre not helping matters is that george f marion who plays anna's estranged dad chris is verbally hard to understand marion gives a good performance as the old drunken seamen whoâs teetering on insanity with his fixation of the evil 'devil sea' but his dialogue is written with a very heavy swedish accent this is true to original play marie dressler's dialogue as marthy owens is equally hard to understand dressler believably portrays a broken down old drunken women a her dialogue also is true to original play as is charles bickford as the irish seamen matt burke who pursues anna in a troubled relationship garbo is actually the easiest to understand br br the films strong point is greta garbo she delivers a gut wrenching performance as the victim of neglect and abuse leading to a life of prostitution garbo was a huge star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in hollywood here her look isn't glamorous it's tortured her body posture nearly doubles over in agony she her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen garbo conveys these angst ridden feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery br br this is dark subject matter and garbo brings it to life itâs not light fare not fun not for everyone is strong emotions dredged up from the depths for examination this is one helluva ride
<START> pumpkinhead was in itself a decent 80s horror flick no classic by any means but an enjoyable piece of fluff why then have we now been treated to a fourth film in this franchise is beyond me as in previous sequels there's nothing here to really connect the films except for the monster the witch and ed harley lance henriksen this time out we follow the feud between the and the mccoys part of the film is a romeo and juliet romance as a young mccoy boy and his hatfield lover decide to run away to be together soon however they are torn apart and the boy's sister is killed the boy escapes to the woods and gets the witch to resurrect pumpkinhead for some vengeance the acting is passable at best amateurish at the worst the titular demon doesn't even really show up for almost forty minutes and when it does its a pale comparison between it and the original design overall blood feud fails to impress it may be worth a watch once but certainly not an addition to the collection
<START> i like armand assante my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again br br the early part is difficult to follow but later it clears up i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends br br some of the acting is unconvincing but maybe that's because i was always expecting some kind of double cross in that case the poor acting would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other so it fits very well br br the important theme is the carnival owner assante is laundering money for a local casino his snake charmer wife wants to steal it she complains to archie reedus how terrible her life is and how he could help her get out of it br br there are 3 or 4 plot twists which is probably the reason for all of those loose ends and just when you think you have solved the mystery something else will happen br br my 8 10 score is mostly for the plot br br i won't say any more i don't like spoilers so i don't want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time
<START> i became a fan of the tv series homicide life on the street' late in the show's run but became a fan very quickly it was a cop show unlike any other visually different in its use of hand held cameras taking the viewer everywhere with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface br br homicide the movie the reunion follow up to the series is as good as a made for television film can be after lt giardello yaphet kotto now a candidate for mayor of baltimore is shot the series' cast members are back to help find the killer in addition the cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film the intensity and fire that marked the series return and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series all in all a terrific tv movie br br vote 9
<START> this is a really really bad movie that may seem like an oversimplification a fickle childish retort comparable to a petty unsubstantiated insult the truth is there is not enough i can say about the confusing senseless plot the really atrocious acting i'm talking nasty here folks or the random images of violence toward women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrendous film making mistakes that propel this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema nay human culture please take my word for it don't watch it ever i'm serious stop you'll thank me for it later
<START> james hacker mp didn't expect that he would be the next prime minister unlike in america the party is elected in britain while we americans vote for candidates regardless of their party despite the differences paul eddington performance as minister turned prime minister almost overnight is helped by his senior adviser sir humphrey played by another knight sir nigel hawthorne and veteran actor derek also returns to the scene as well now instead of pleasing some people he has to please the nation rather than his now he has a hard job to do even more difficult than before now he must approve the honors list and work with her majesty as well on a regular basis hacker is not the hacking type he is rather than the every man who we like and don't want to dislike and turn into a villain of sorts or a vicious dictator now we see the prime minister's point of view and all the pleasing that must go on as well as handle strikes
<START> just watched this today on tcm where the other reviewers here saw it br br sorry that i was the only one to find davies a weak actress with a truly awful attempt at an irish irish american or otherwise accent as she's the star it was sort of hard for me to get past that especially as the other reviewers have said that this was her finest performance br br another particularly terrible davies performance was in marianne 1929 which i also watched today in this film given a 9 of 10 rating here her accent switches from that of a correct french woman to an odd combination of italian and swiss br br interestingly in tcm's one hour bio of davies captured on film the true story of marion davies 2001 film historian jeanine basinger claims that one of the things that you note about marion davies in her sound work is how good she is at doing accents of course this bio also includes commentary by fans make of that what you will br br davies was a very attractive young woman and by all accounts a terrific comedienne in real life br br and because a part of her anatomy added immeasurably to the real life answer to joseph character's search for the meaning behind kane's final word in the opening scene of the great citizen kane she's earned her spot among the great stories if hollywood's history br br but i think welles mankiewicz got it right for the most part with the susan alexander facsimile of the real article br br don't bother voting as to whether you agree or disagree with this post as i really couldn't care less
<START> although the plot of cover girl is very flimsy and tired it does serve well enough as an anchor for the kern and gershwin musical numbers following her signature role in gilda hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her besides looking as gorgeous as ever she impresses with her dancing as well gene kelly who was on loan to columbia from mgm matches her in dancing and the sequence where he with his own shadow was nicely done the supporting characters were also competently acted personally i didn't enjoy cover girl as much as the musicals hayworth made with fred astaire however cover girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend my score 7 10
<START> i found the first 90 minutes of this film to be very interesting even though a few parts of it were ridiculous i e philip seymour hoffman's character the last 60 minutes were distasteful and i began to lose interest in the film the last hour lasted forever it seemed br br the movie is nicely acted and i can see why rene zellweger won an academy award since her character was so interesting the movie also is beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional one however i found the message to be a bad one not surprising these days in hollywood in this story jude law deserts the confederate army during the civil war his reason his girlfriend misses him and wants him home he's also getting disillusioned with war can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat deserted the army in the two world wars br br yet in this film of course all of that is perfectly acceptable then again what liberal filmmaker has ever had a nice thing to say about the u s military to add to their left wing slant they portray a vigilante like posse going after as cold blooded sick killers well in the world of films as we know good is portrayed as bad and bad is good and only liberals would portray as heroes
<START> possibly john cassavetes best film to date and definitely his funniest seymour cassel plays the young moskowitz smitten with real life wife of cassavetes gena rowlands excellent as usual a must see gem of a film if you can locate it
<START> something does not work in this movie there are absolutely no energies between the actors in fact their very acting seems frozen sometimes amateur also the script is not convincing and not reliable
<START> the one thing that can be said about running out of time is that it's an immensely clever film it's interesting to note that the film's writers are french which may explain the movie's out of the norm vibe as it doesn't really fit in with what is commonly called hong kong cinema br br the movie concerns a thief who plans revenge on some criminal types using the assistance of an equally clever cop but first he has to convince the cop to join his personal crusade and so begins a series of games where the thief the cop into his plan br br quite a clever movie br br 7 out of 10 br br go to www nixflix com for a more detailed review of this movie or full length reviews of other foreign films
<START> although at times i was the only one in the cinema who was laughing this is the main pleasure i took from the beautifully shot thirst laughter although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals br br it helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful and that i was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became br br i read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong i didn't think so in fact the last scenes moving and hilarious i mean the brown shoes by turns were among the best in the film
