<START> if you like his show you might be a little disappointed this movie has some very funny moments and the laughs are pretty constant but none are very memorable or as funny as the things on the show the beginning sequence is really really silly and funny and a great start yes borat does make a cameo appearance br br if you are a fan then watch it if you don't know him or don't like him then don't bother 6 5 10
<START> firstly i loved the book more so than the more popular da vinci code and although the film was not well received i liked it and bought the dvd however there is no chance that i will ever want to watch angles and demons ever again br br the film barely resembles the book in fact only the general premise of the story is there br br from the very start of the film i was disappointed in the book robert langdon receives a call and fax from maximilian kohler director of who finds the body of father can't remember the name and then requests langdon to come using the super fast plane in the book the only people who knew about this technology that the father and daughter team had created were themselves and the in the film however there was a massive team involved so the tension was never there how did they find out etc br br leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie it changed everything that happened from then on when the was confronted in the locked room it should have been maximilian kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair the commander rushed in to get the but was shot by in the film it was the commander in the room and was shot err i think i got this right but i was bored and can't really remember the events in the film br br there was no love interest between and robert and in the book she wasn't at when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work in the book all four of the were killed but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain in the book was kidnapped and robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the assassin at the church of the not blown up like he was in the film by the the bit where robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there saved by his mickey mouse watch alarm ok in the book we are led to believe that langdon bailed out of the helicopter fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched but it was important in the film because he had to race back with the film there was no mention of how and her adopted father became involved this was also important in getting to know the character of br br in all one of the worse films i have seen i would have left early but my brain went numb and i lost the use of my legs temporarily a really really poor attempt and not one of ron finest in fact how he will get work again is beyond me i want my money back
<START> another laughably lame and senseless low budget sci fi tv but actually its kind of kind ofÂ in a passably undemanding way am i being soft i don't know why they come up with these titles yes there's a komodo and yes there's a cobra however what's the deal with in between sure they do come to blowsÂ in only two sequences one recapping an incident and the other being the dodgy climax and quite boring exchanges i might add the get up is the same old routine of a scientific experiment getting out of hand on a secluded island no dinosaurs about and some innocent bystanders environmentalists hoping to expose animal testing getting caught up in it this sees a komodo dragon and cobra becoming massive in statue with the government soon wanting to destroy any sort of the evidence including witnesses of its existence by blowing up the island so this leaves the survivors racing against time to find a way off the prominent staples existed of awful video game cgi hack script few dingy sets although the tropical island setting was easy on the eyes throwaway characters but i found the performances faired up lifelessly tacky thrills which for some reason kept using the same repetitive shot of the victim just standing there in which implied i'm waiting please eat me now i'm not going anywhere and eventually they were swallowed well almost as it seemed to always take a second gulp to finish them off or just save the hassle by stupidly squashing them and a very hysterical edge with some sort of wretch message amongst the acts of survival director jim wynorski seems to be on cruise control throughout michael parÃ© has fun with his gruff dialogues and michelle added much needed sparks renee talbert is there to pout a lot quite successfully too
<START> this three hour chinese epic set in 220 b c may ultimately amount to a familiar theme of an emperor's idealistic dream of peace through unification mutating into corrupted isolation and there's nothing inherently challenging about the film but it's a compelling narrative crammed with intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid strokes even for those not drawn to such historical spectacles for their own sake it's an astonishing feast for the eyes the scene depicting the coup attempt of the marquis is one of the most staggering of physical space and grandeur in memory and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their immediacy the title sums up the film's use of compelling contrasts huge vistas set against intimate horrors the of motives set against the most degraded hope turning to dust if you've never seen a three hour chinese epic this wouldn't be a bad place to start
<START> i learned much from previous viewer reactions is there one that does not mention too glib is concept i love fred astaire musicals the great great songs fred's peerless grace but comrades if you see idle brainless rich parasites dancing on the downtrodden unemployed that's a valid criticism of any movie is steeped in the values of its time place not to mention those who fund it Â the pipers who call the tune great art transcends all as did as did 'all quiet on the western front' i confess i saw it last 40 odd years ago but the images are burned in my brain it's the greatest battle scene ever likely to be filmed and it makes you horrified to be thrilled ice' did someone say that's real death you're watching real extras died making this 'real is now special effects defined it seems likewise 'too for an age of shrunken attention spans mozart had 'too many propaganda catholic church defamed the vatican was still at it when they called on ancient favors to get the german christian democrat gov to recognize croatia in the 1990s Â remember the chaos forget the props the lighting of nevsky painted the medieval world Â like a there's one in hampton court palace showing a massacre crude dutch nationalist propaganda maybe but it tears at the heart stylized acting so what's henry v olivier movie naturalism does anyone believe english medieval knight killers talked like that as said the music of is magnificent only ken russell eisenstein had the balls genius to match sound image at this 100 octane level ok you want the bit i'll risk the nervy every time eisenstein did not copy wehrmacht helmets rather his model seems to have been those buckets worn by in nazi of the 1930s eisenstein was a genius but unlike hollywood directors he had near unlimited non commercial time funding modern russian directors are free from political shackles but have no money even kurasawa had to make a late great movie in communist russia he was revered but in his own country much like russell how much propaganda is in the eye of the beholder imagine sane people from another peace loving world how would they react to nevsky would the battle or the grieving for the dead dominate their if we didn't know about the gas chambers ss what about of the will' where can i get a nevsky dvd cheap
<START> seagal fans beware he does no action scenes until almost an hour into this mess instead seagal runs away from numerous fights letting ja rule convincingly lose every battle actually ja rule could be an up and coming action star but hollywood needs to let him at least hit puberty which should happen in a few more years also what sort of commando terrorist wears a bare midriff outfit the chick in this atrocity looks like a backup singer for christina aguilera back to seagal when he finally does cut loose it's his stunt double heavily padded to resemble the bloated seagal doing a lot of the work taking the falls i don't remember any aikido either it's just your standard kicks punches you'd see in any straight to video martial arts turkey not even so bad it's funny either just plain dull
<START> sadness and nostalgia permeate late a 1954 film by japanese auteur now undergoing a retrospective of his long unavailable films thanks to james of cinematheque ontario and the japan foundation based on three stories by fumiko late tells the story of four retired geishas now middle aged whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret performance are uniformly outstanding particularly that of who starred in films by ozu's late spring floating weeds and tokyo story among others portrays kin a former geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak br br she has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money particularly real estate speculation and money to her friends nobu and tomi yuko all former geishas friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how kin has become greedy and tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet both tomi and are in the process of losing their children son is leaving to work in the in and daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable br br two male friends visit kin a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide and ken another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as kin confronts and tomi and console each other over the loss of their children the dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who though their future does not seem bright refuse to see themselves merely as victims late has the simplicity humor and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way
<START> utopia made in 1950 in france was the last film laurel and hardy produced with the bad reputation the duo have for their post 1930's productions i was expecting this film to be awful although admittedly it isn't up to the standard of their vintage comedies i was pleasantly surprised it's watchable and in parts genuinely funny and certainly the plot is of the same standard as you'd expect some gags are derivative from their earlier work but when you consider this film was their first for five years after their last hollywood produced film the bullfighters the routines are executed confidently as you'd expect from these professionals some scenes are not up to much but the value of this film is that some scenes are funny and as such absolutely priceless i particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene br br i felt sad at the end of the film our heros are left on their own desert island it's such a metaphor for the real life truth hollywood and audiences of the time had consigned the stars to a desert island of memories and that was to become last image they portrayed in film ollie died seven years later and stan died fifteen years later stan turned down an offer to appear in it's a mad mad mad mad world in 1963 what a shame that was a colour film only two years before he passed however his health probably wasn't up to much br br these boys are probably the greatest comedy performers of all time and although the movie is far from their true potential it's still an honour to watch them appear in film for the last time and touching on the echos of their towering talent
<START> i loved this movie when i was a kid i saw it theatrically randy edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack david seville is the father and recording manager the chipmunks consist of alvin who is best known for playing the harmonica simon who is a bright and studious chipmunk theodore who is the youngest and is always hungry there is a lady known as miss miller who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as brittany jeanette eleanor who all have the same character as the chipmunks my favourite songs from this soundtrack include diamond dolls the girls of rock roll the touching my mother alvin really wanted to see europe when dave had to go there for business the chipmunks meet the playing the around the world in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing
<START> as i write this in november 2005 i've become aware that the great british boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the british government not giving film makers tax breaks i think the cause is much simpler a lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years let's have a look at what the brits were producing 1995 2005 br br funky gangster thrillers lock stock and two smoking was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape guy ritchie's style with usually disappointing results br br romantic comedies yeah okay i do realise four weddings notting hill etc were produced by american studios but they're still vaguely british films unfortunately because they're guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved hugh grant playing hugh grant for the umpteenth time br br black comedies can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is in the british context it's usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles mike leigh's naked br br jasmin beautiful people is a good example of the third type of british movie filmed in 1999 but set in 1993 it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and it's later revealed that one's a serb and one's a croat so we get a bite sized rundown of what was happening in the balkans at that time though what's the odds of two former enemies in the balkans bumping into each other on a london bus this sums up one of the major flaws of the movie irony takes precedence over likely situations you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film it's called beautiful people but certainly this audience member found them clichÃ©d stereotypical people that i couldn't believe in as three dimensional characters
<START> i grew up outside of germany where they landed every detail of the film was 100 authentic the power lines that they flew over the nosy neighbors the grandmother telling the kids that they cant watch west german tv etc this movie brings back lots of good memories to those that are european a great production from disney the same movie in german has klaus lowitsch and gunter meisner using their own voices for translating the english version into german for the german version they also use birds a bird that is native to germany as background noise to let you know that you are in germany i showed this move to many of my german relative and they really liked this movie these people made made a prototype balloon which they had to give up because the materials that they used was too and the other 2 balloons that they used for the escape the burner problem was solved when they turned the propane cylinders upside down
<START> i don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but i saw a poster for some things that stay and i thought that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious not like the usual blonde teenybopper bs so i decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night br br i must tell you i was happily surprised i went to this film with no expectations i didn't really know what it would be about but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by katie boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision alberta watson also did a fantastic job as the role of disease stricken mother and i must also add that i was quite impressed with the comedic stylings of megan park as friend brenda br br the film was wonderfully directed by gail harvey and pulled together in the kind of kitschy 50's way that leaves you feeling warm and happy even if the storyline tended not to be so uplifting i also thought that the film was well shot many beautiful images of a 1950's countryside will remain in my mind for weeks to come br br this film as a whole was quirky and great i found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open ended way i was still left satisfied whether you are looking for a fun yet powerful coming of age story or simply want to reminisce about life in the 1950's i guarantee this film is for you even if you have no expectations it is still quite likely that you will be most impressed give this one a shot
<START> spoilers beware flashdance is a fair movie in my opinion some things do confuse me about it e g jeanie asks alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing alex replies about 25 years isn't alex supposed to be 18 and some things do fascinate me about it i loved the spins overall though it intrigued me when this movie was made i wasn't even born i didn't really experience the eighties i was born in '85 and i have to wonder sometimes alex would just run in place a bit or throw herself all over not really dancing just banging in to things tossing her head back and waving her arms was this considered dancing back then if it was i'm not sure i could've it the spins the flip the fluid movements were great but some of it my neighbor's toddler could've done better also if alex is a during the day wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work when she doesn't go to work for nearly a week wouldn't she be laid off living in a warehouse i can almost see it but not quite it doesn't seem right that she's a owns a warehouse house and is trying to get into ballet none of it really makes sense i shouldn't be too judgemental considering my own background but please maybe jennifer beals is too feminine for me to see her as a i don't know but either way they could've picked a better actress the actors were fine i even liked the romance you make your own decision but mine is rent it once don't see it again it isn't worth it
<START> essential viewing for anyone who watches tv news as it may help to become a little more sceptical or even cynical on a personal note i recall taking a course some years ago about being interviewed for tv what to do what not to do the course instructors impressed on us that tv news was a branch of show biz that depressing view which is probably even more valid today than when it was made is reinforced by this film never mind journalistic integrity what counts is the ability to look good and smile nicely and make sure you don't sweat on camera br br the interactions between the three main characters form the centre piece each with his or her own ambitions capabilities and beliefs brooks takes these differences and sets them into the volatile setting of a tv news studio and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mixture the result is a complex if somewhat overlong portrayal of how we compromise every day in order to meet our ambitions and take others with us it is always entertaining although the final scene was perhaps unnecessary given everything that had gone before
<START> this story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago after all this time the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men this story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms but it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life the most of what i liked in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their deaths the special effects were something every time i heard her call out to them i would think not that face again but it was a good movie i just wish that the pace was not as slow or the acting not as tiresome and what i also liked about the movie was the flashback of the 20's very authentic as well as the costumes being original
