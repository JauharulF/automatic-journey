<START> alfred hitchcock's saboteur 1942 not to be confused with another hitchcock film sabotage made in 1936 which has a completely different plot is not the master of suspense greatest film it dose not have the depth of vertigo 1958 nor the brooding atmosphere of 1940 and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in notorious 1946 but what it dose have is thrills adventure and a nail biting climax the two leads admittedly are quite weak it is easy to understand why hitchcock wanted gary cooper for the robert cummings role and barbara stanwyck for the role that was taken by priscilla lane also the patriotic speeches that says that were written by dorothy parker have dated badly and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false however the last half hour is edge of your seat viewing the climax atop the stature of liberty is very well done and the film is a clear predecessor of north by northwest 1959 the two villains otto kruger and norman lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the aircraft factory is a superb sequence this not the best film hitch made but it is surly one of his most entertaining
<START> one of two movies i have actually thought about asking for money to stay until the end most movies have at least one thing that is worth staying for even if it just to laugh at how bad it is i never found it for this movie nothing was good from the script to the very bad effects the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> chris nolan's labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish a first film is as complex as memento or the prestige though maybe a little harder to get a handle on still it smacks of originality and creative drive and has a twist as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to narrative that nolan has the story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street until he follows someone whose noticed him following others and has been following him in from there the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange more naturalistic and realist than nolan's later work but just as razor sharp
<START> here is a movie that almost gets it all right with good performances from everyone and three strong leading performances from hanks seymour hoffman and a fine turn up from julia roberts that had me spell bound from the first few seconds these are performances that lift the production to the stars and keep it there for the duration br br apart from one or two very minor factual problems with the script the only thing that lets this movie down is the technical direction there are far too many bad cuts fudged continuity and a number of camera cheats that simply do not work this is surprising for a movie of this stature and is a little annoying to watch but it does not destroy an otherwise beautifully crafted film
<START> it's a shame that by garnering a restricted rating perhaps the audience that would find this film the most useful won't likely see it br br imaginary heroes follows the life of a teenager after his brothers' suicide not of course the most original story in the world however it does spend a great deal of time humanizing their parents the heroes' that failed in their sons' eyes br br for teenagers who tend to put responsibility for their failures on their parents but yet refuse to accept any real responsibility on their own the movie sends a powerful message that in the end we all have our own troubles we need to deal with and that we all make our own paths br br but unlike other movies that tend to urge youth independence this one resolves the issues between parents and child and they become a stronger unit for it that the eldest child committed suicide is regrettable but not overlooked later in the film and the responsibility by all parties for the tragedy is thoroughly explained br br although the subject matter has been covered before it hasn't been covered quite this way the film pulls very little punches now why this earned it an r rating is confusing you're unlikely to get across to a teenager in this era without being realistic but yet providing realism restricts that very audience br br were my junior high school class have been shown this film two suicides may have been prevented in this case the censors seem to have exercised extremely poor judgment br br 8 10
<START> hair the movie based on the broadway hit fails to achieve any redeemable cinematic qualities you cant really take the play and make it a movie whether one is so tempted by the rock music to see this movie it really detracts from the quality of a broadway show worse than seeing sitcom reruns musical fiasco and cant believe others rated it so high
<START> 28 years before 9 11 there was another 9 11 which represented a key date in the history of chile south america and the whole world this was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in chile deposed salvador allende the first marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace br br unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history the times were troubled and allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world true he was democratically elected but his policies plunged chile into economic crisis he was deposed by a coup and a right wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses but he was also an ally of castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution we'll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded the authors of the movie take a completely pro allende position there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by castro the tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic almost propagandistic people who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future
<START> some people don't appreciate the magical elements in ros but they are what sets this series apart that and the fact the producers actually decided to dress the actors in proper period clothes and armour not anachronistic feathered caps multi coloured tights and plate armour br br but i am really writing to comment on an earlier poster's article um michael did not leave ros to do jules verne there are 15 years between these two series yup i agree and michael might well agree too that leaving ros was not a good move but it was a coveted broadway role that tempted him in '84 and then dynasty with its megabucks paychecks
<START> showtime is a funny film starring robert deniro meet the parents a bronx tale and eddie murphy shrek dr dolittle the story is this in the beginning of the movie detective mitch robert deniro and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals when the cops arrive tray eddie murphy a cop tries to arrest mitch not knowing he's a cop during this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer chase ritz she is so excited about their adventures together she decides to make a tv show called showtime starring tray the cop and mitch the detective but that's just the funny part the rest is strictly suspense and action there is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns while playing lapd on the show and doing it in real life deniro and murphy have quite an adventure in this story on a scale of 1 10 i give it a seven or 8
<START> just saw around here the only line they came up with to sell it is from the fx team behind independence day i think that says a great deal no talk about writers directors actors br br it's a cute little adventure story set in a banana republic in mid america but the storyline is thin br br all the way through the movie i kept thinking about how much this movie looks like the cut scenes from some action computer war game although the fxs are nice they all too often are visible much like the cut scenes in cgs style like br br you almost instantly know that that particular truck backdrop bridge castle or jet fighter never existed the look is smooth and nice but not up to the standard we have come to expect of action adventures today the movie is lacking a lot of obvious on location filming br br the acting storyline is below average and the fxs are nice but not up to feature film standard i am not surprised this thing went straight to video dvd br br
<START> back when in the states i was like about 7 or 8 i always woke early just to watch this together with a whole bunch of other cartoons like the road runner show the pink panther but this was perhaps one of the most memorable and funny animated works out there and i still find it very funny today i'll never forget the episodes like the one where two aardvarks were fighting over the can of chocolate ant pudding or the one where the is trying to reach the island where all the ants are at and my personal favorite the one where the ant the and a dog end up in an animal hospital which would later be the basis of a similar looney toon cartoon with sylvester tweety and the bulldog this is one of the most unforgettable cartoons out there in which anyone would love to revisit i would an excellent series
<START> you see a movie titled what are you going to think space battles with cool as heck explosions and everyone shooting at each other what do you get with this movie well you do get some space battle goodness but for a great majority of the time it's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing no one talks what is this nonsense we get a narrators and a ton of british computers but thats about it the main protagonist must be the worst one i have ever seen as she doesn't even have any dialog and sleepwalks though scenes some of the things happening are just stupid like they use a rocket like to go to space for basic transportation planet side why not just use one of those nifty space ships in any case the music is almost non existent with a few boring dull lifeless samples but the main thing you will notice is the atari sound effects the ships use you have got to be kidding me i can also tell that the budget was low because everything looks fake which is not what you would expect from a movie especially what should be a super cool space battle movie i seriously think the budget must have been in the double digits it is so bad making you laugh more than you should at how plain bad it is i am starting to think that they paid the actors based on how much dialog they had because their is very little here if you can't tell already that is my main gripe here as i probably said that like 3 times already
<START> i agree with who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating br br examples br br pierre is going to marry his cousin even though his love for her seems very cousin y br br pierre and his stepmother have a rather curious relationship br br pierre lucie and seem to have a triangular relationship and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain br br brother is a bit of a eunuch or is he br br and isabelle who is she really br br overall i think it was worth my time an interesting film and one that makes me want to read melville
<START> this movie was talked about in fangoria where i heard about this it was interesting to me mostly becuase it was direct to video and i recognized two of the stars on the cover james marsden of disturbing behavior and christine taylor from the craft and to my surprise on valentine's day when i was searching through the horror aisle to find it on the shelf i immediately had to grab it me and my brother and our girlfriends watched it and to my surprise it was pretty good the tales were interesting and for once they were actually scary unlike a lot of other horror movies being made recently some of the plot i do not understand but once i watch it again i bet i'll get it and to even more of my surprise there were other stars i recognized including one of the girls from the tv show my so called life and from the real world i'm not sure why this movie was only direct to video with a little advertising this movie could have at least made up for how much money was spent on making it the only problem i have is that since it wasn't released in theatres i guess i'll never be able to view it in widescreen you should definitely take a chance and rent this one br br
<START> i think the film makes a reference to rouge of kieslowski as the whole atmosphere gives me a feeling of red it seems to be that a lot of the backgrounds contain red think of the tea room f e i also think this is one of the greatest movies of the last years
