<START> i knew it was going to be awful but not this awful as it's one of the most boring movies i have ever seen not a damn thing happens all the characters are dull and the story is stupid and incredibly boring plus the ending is especially lame the only reason i rented this piece of crap because i am a big fan of michael dudikoff however he is wasted here and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever plus i cheered out loud when the movie was over it's like the movie had no plot and it was all about nothing and ice t is god awful even though he is ok in some stuff plus dudikoff and yvette nipar had no chemistry together at all there's one scene that the director tried to make emotional but he fails miserably as yvette nipar didn't really show all that much emotion however there is a decent car chase scene but that's not enough for me to recommend this god awful film plus the dialog is atrocious avoid this movie like the plague not a damn thing happens please avoid and trust me on this one you may thank me afterwords the direction is horrible fred olen ray does a horrible job here with shoddy camera work laughably cheap looking set pieces terrible angles laughable use of stock footage and keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace the acting is terrible michael dudikoff is nowhere near his usual amazing self he looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever his character is also extremely dull as i can't believe he signed on for this piece of garbage he also had no chemistry with yvette nipar dudikoff still rules ice t has barely anything to do and also looks bored and he didn't convince me one bit is not very good here he had somewhat of a wimpy character i didn't like him yvette nipar is pretty but was really terrible here she didn't show much emotion and had no chemistry with dudikoff and as a result i didn't give a damn about her character art owen marsh kathy katharine marsh and the rest of the cast are bad as well overall please avoid like the plague fred olen ray and steve should be ashamed of themselves bomb out of 5
<START> i love low budget movies including those that are intentionally or un intentionally funny excess fake gore violence etc br br this however is beyond stupid once you see the ending you'll say what the hell was the point of all the killing scenes with no one around except in a couple to witness them and how did the ending actually come about i won't give the whole story away for those dumb enough to actually watch this granny is like a psychic jason first she's outside the window with a body and 15 seconds later she's in the living room knitting the whole thing is a setup for a newcomer they pull off graphic kill scenes the knitting needles in the eyes that only chris angel mind freak could pull off and again the very end was pre posterous 56 min waste of time i've seen one of the directors other films and it was almost as bad give me 20 grand and i could do better this really deserves a big fat 0
<START> there were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out and out liars and yet they are made to look good i never bought into that stuff the screwball comedies were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the fred astaire films br br here barbara stanwyck plays a famous country magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona and her job she even lies to a guy about getting married another topic that was always trivialized in classic films br br she's a new york city woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies etc obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track i guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails etc etc please pass the barf bag br br most of this film is not funny stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre as for dennis morgan well pass the bag again
<START> oh boy i really trashed manhunt in space i think this deservedly rates worse than manhunt it goes nowhere and growth was more exciting than this tripe br br poor she's so misunderstood smug rocky struts around and thankfully there's no mention from about his gay nightlife there's a lot more talking a really awful to watch space marriage on the rocks and crappy space effects cut outs then there's bobby you decide who's more annoying bobby or the personally i'd jettison them out of an airlock into a black hole not before first subjecting them to killer flesh eating alien mutants br br at least there's she's just a cosmic girl
<START> i have no idea why people are so crazy about the show it is so boring the jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny it's like alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background my friend and i just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other what's so funny seriously every time we watched that show you wouldn't hear any laughing or coughing just a blank look so we stop watching it i am personally a fan of sitcoms so i tried to watch the show but the show us such a disappointment this show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom ever
<START> freddy forsyth has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the west's suspicions about russia forsyth installs a nasty guy as the president who wants to return the country not so much to communism but more to hitlerian fascism in fact his political manifesto could have come straight out of mein kampf rather than marx and the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing of the russian federation american mercenaries with the russian prez to realise his fanatical genocidal dream but then enter dirty pat swayze and yep things get really down and dirty he's a former us operative turned drifter jason monk who is enlisted by the british government to see what the russians are up to as a corny sidebar swayze's character who is no monk has sired a russian beauty elena played by the gorgeous marta on his previous missions to the former commie state swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil russians but young unknown actress marta steals the flick as his nubile 18 year old russian daughter elena who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved mother russia
<START> i was quite excited when i saw this film in competition at the montreal film festival along with elephant and a few others i thought the issue of american gun violence culture would be treated intelligently and in a fashion compelling for film goers the press release promised in not so many words a red for the gun violence crowd something to make us ponder our nra shoot em up mindset in this country br br after waiting until after 9 15 to be seated for a 9am screening what technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me we were finally let into the venue to see the film on dv where did the advertised 35mm print go i think i just answered my first question br br the result is an abhorrent mess we get the gun in a vignette with the most unrealistic i have ever seen and i do know more than a few the film then lapses into irrelevant character development only because the characters are either a stereotyped b losers c stereotyped losers and or d racial caricatures it takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement and once we are there we wish for the inane conversations between the couples and or the bikers and pawn brokers br br the film finds it's conclusion but not without leaving any clichÃ© untried i didn't care for the white trash characters who came in contact with the gun and the depiction of the minority characters should have the naacp crying foul immediately all these people would chase after a gun because they are at the bottom of the societal trash heap and would look for an opportunity wherever it was found placing the action a level up would have at least provided some soul searching on the part of the characters br br the biggest problem is the promise unfulfilled the plot outline was great in the hands of a p t anderson or gus van zandt it could have been a powerful piece but due either to bad screenplay direction or both the thing is an unmitigated mess that needs to be ignored at all costs br br my bigger question is who at the thought this was competition material better bury this on showtime at 3am br br art
<START> the first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the willis character were pretty enjoyable especially with jean smart but it really tanked after that this is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all i know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that willis was just as irritating in his younger self but i found this kid especially irritating and
<START> once again we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists' work has been fully restored and we see this old time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy etc br br in essence this is a story of those goods coming to life such as the animals on the labels of items or a pie or even a pack of cigarettes br br the whole show is narrated by jack bunny a jack benny impersonator with music from conductor leopold who was in so many looney tunes animated shorts i have lost count a lot of the humor is topical so it pays to know who little egypt and other characters the busby berkeley type aqua number with bathing suited coming out of the can and the tomato can can dance were both clever br br all of the above and more was in the first half of this slightly longer than normal length cartoon the second half was about a king kong type which escapes from the animal crackers box and terrorizes everyone that part was not much and ended on a somewhat stupid note so an a for the first half a d for the second making it about a c plus or b minus overall
<START> this is a fine concept piece and the acting by brando is a fine piece of work dean martin isn't bad and montgomery clift is quite good as well unfortunately it's a very disjointed very long piece that really should have been edited down to something closer to 2 hours it's almost 3 hours br br we follow the lives of 3 men from 1938 through the end of wwii and watch as they discover who they are and what they might become as they discover both the world about them and what they're made of for some it's the women in their lives that brings about this realization for others it's the broader general circumstances all too often however i found myself asking what had just happened or what the import of a particular scene was
<START> this movie is about carlos the quinn an international terrorist who by cia agent henry sutherland description appears to women and children for the heck of it at least that's what he says to guilt us naval officer ramirez quinn again into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the kgb ramirez is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his antithesis he is borne of order and carlos is borne of chaos br br the movie isn't all shoot gun jump around action and that's a good thing in its first half ramirez undergoes training to act and think like carlos and that's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run of the mill action flicks an israeli agent kingsley joins fields in training ramirez and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of new character ramirez is taught to dislike the things carlos dislikes to act on the split second like carlos would and even to make love like carlos courtesy of an ex girlfriend of naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie it's a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carlos wannabe br br another thing i liked about this movie was that it didn't utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies you know the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin's family family does come into the picture but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life br br good chuckle humor is injected into this movie often coming the acerbic duo of sutherland and kingsley an exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving first name annabelle get it also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is in my opinion during the final showdown the payoff wasn't able to match the build up br br on the whole the movie was enjoyable i'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout br br my rating 9 10
<START> since i am a fan of natalie portman i had to see the movie i enjoyed every minute of it it plays out in a very sincere way throughout the whole movie at seemed as if natalie was the mother and susan was the mother susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it br br i heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving natalie and some guy he's in outside providence but natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed and i think that is great i think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film br br natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because i haven't seen her in a bad film yet so any movie that has natalie portman will no doubt be seen by me br br a good film 7 10
<START> this is a bad film as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts as a result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr huston should have been proud of making however the film is worth watching if you are a fan of pre code films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out even if they aren't married and even if their partner is br br the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi in the process she meets a bruce cabot who eventually convinces her to sleep with him she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman however miss dunne does not want him back as she realizes he's not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth while all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always alluded to almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time br br surprisingly this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and cabot ends about 1 4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it it on to still another film in this second phase of the film miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women's prison though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate and as a result of all this violence miss dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer br br but then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the women's prison reform business goes by the wayside dunne meets a judge walter huston who is married but he desperately wants her now throughout the film dunne is portrayed as a very good girl even though she did have unmarried sex with cabot she was more or less tricked into it but now single irene who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his assurance off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business but while she's pregnant with his love child he's indicted for being a crooked judge he assures her he's innocent but he's convicted and it sure sounds like he's a scoundrel using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to a fortune then in the final moments of the film miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released the film then ends br br so we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like i gathered that she should be a strong minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships this really undoes all the positives about dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine anyone liking the film a strong women's rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect with a decent re write this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film but it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre code film
<START> margaret mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess fine costuming and sets can't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by joanne whalley as the title character and the ever bland timothy dalton as rhett even worse than the acting and perhaps partially explaining it is the script which is astoundingly cliched and predictable add to that hellishly bad script a score that'll have you cringing and you've got a disaster i wouldn't wish on any viewer scarlett is just amazingly lousy and i can't imagine how it ever got made much less made it to video
<START> disclaimer during my ventures into foreign cinema i have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror action drama comedy and romance to name a few thus i have enjoyed the thoughtful serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless popcorn fun of action films with a wide array of chinese japanese and korean movies under my belt i am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement unfortunately ashes of time has nothing to recognize it is one of the worst chinese movies i have ever seen br br to start off this overrated swordplay epic showcases the infamous slideshow action sequence throughout which is nothing more than an ultra cheap and pathetic form of action choreography one simply needs to show a series of close up pictures of faces swords legs and or arms and then a dead body you now have an action sequence for ashes of time the problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on br br the dramatic element of this film is nonexistent as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing such elements on screen which renders all characters generic and colorless leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions in fact the storyline itself is an absolute disaster introducing way too many characters way too quickly with way too many plot devices plot complexities in films can be used very i e a tale of two sisters but ashes of time becomes exploitative trash when it does nothing more than convolute a very simple plot for no apparently good reason br br in fact this entire movie acts like a series of to cover up its deficiencies horrible action choreography is covered up by slideshow tricks and chaotic camera movements non existent character development is covered up by the characters overtly saying how they feel and a thoughtless storyline is covered up by confusing the viewer with br br as if this weren't bad enough this movie was extremely boring seeming more like 150 minutes instead of the actual 95 br br rating a rarely given 0 5 stars
