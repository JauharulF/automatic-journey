<START> this movie started with some promise big name cast good looking sets but then it fell apart br br most of the time it can't tell whether it's a serious movie or a comedy one minute they're talking about how there's no joy in killing and the next there is a fight scene set to funny music and funny banter br br some of the acting is pretty bad mainly from patrick swayze and piper perabo she also gets some groaner lines like when i marry it will be about love ugh br br but the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring not enough action not enough humor not enough plot not much of anything really just a lot of clichÃ©s and cheesy moments br br also a movie with dragon in the title should contain a lot more dragons than the few and pathetic cgi dragons that appeared in this movie br br can't the scifi channel show any good movies
<START> strange things happen to americans will greg evigan maura alexandra paul and their young daughter aubrey briana evigan greg's real life daughter when they move into a large newly inherited house in ireland crusty corpses are found in the cellar a turkey squirts blood furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and a cackling old lady show up to scare the little girl paranormal investigators are eventually called in to banish the evil spirits but maura becomes possessed anyway and chases everyone around with a meat cleaver br br this film is full of cliches but there's a standout performance from alexandra paul too bad it doesn't belong in this movie nor any other i can think of off hand she can barely keep a straight face and her over emoting and hysterical screaming tantrums are a joy to behold in any case she's a lot more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie br br score 3 out of 10
<START> for starters i once met the director when he was going to ww2 re enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked darned good i really wish he'd kept that up because as much as i applaud what he accomplished on a clearly next to nothing budget when i popped out the dvd i just wondered why i sat through almost two hours of nothing there's no real plot to speak of you don't really care what happens to the characters maybe the italian troops and some of the germans and the ending is yet another art film commentary on the futility of war i could have told someone how it would end once i got through the first ten minutes i knew the germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death i knew most of the gis would be killed it was just too darned obvious and while i'm on the subject i was shocked to see so much of the axis side done well yet the gi side done comically all the character development was clearly for non english speaking roles the gis simply got shafted hard in this film and i can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the us army works the phrases terminology actions were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the american military at all had i now known who had directed this film i'd have sworn it was directed and written by a german
<START> although it can be very tedious at times this movie is really not all that bad the acting is fairly well done if stereotypical and the production values are pretty high considering some of the sci fi movies that were to come later in the decade br br my biggest problem with this film are some of the very outdated characterizations in it there's the guy from texas the professional scientist and worst of all the woman scientist who finally realizes her womanhood for a film seeking to make a statement about mankind it loses some of it's impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes
<START> i remember hearing about this movie and how it played at nearly every drive in theatre here in toronto it's about a group of girls that are not accepted by the other sororities at their college so they start up their own and of course call it h o t s it's a fun movie that is just bursting with drive in nostalgia lots of fully endowed t shirts vans fighting and a football game showdown like no other it's been compared to animal house which is a good movie in it's own right but to me nothing compares to h o t s it has it's own brand of fun character if you are looking for a classic t movie look no further because the h o t s girls are to the rescue boom boom shorts all

<START> blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in dog's blood her parents ely randy colton blanche leslie fleming mitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself is considered a danger to herself other's ranch hand ex priest miguel del recognises isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron who is her other daughter claire's madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms suspicions accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl free br br directed by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism i kept asking the same question over over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total utter unashamed rip off of the exorcist 1973 you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share there's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past against other's the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor's the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than it's total crap is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the character's are poorly written fleshed out at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse after he states that she needs a 'little he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at least br br according to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest there isn't even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up there's a scene of a cut arm there's a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix that's about it there's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of are seen one pair of naked female is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film too br br with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache a terrible accent he is better than this br br blackwater valley exorcism is a complete rip off of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish
<START> spoilers i rented tesis or thesis in english on the strength of director alejandro amenabar's later effort the others based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror instead i wound up with the most tedious preposterous excuse for a lame brained slasher movie i've seen since the german film anatomie which this one kinda reminded me of br br the plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes it revolves around innocent n pretty psychology student angela's ana torrent a jessica harper deadringer thesis on the subject of violence in films through some far fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera angela and her horror buff friend chema fele martinez are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it br br this leads to well nothing br br they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events even when their own lives at risk and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls there is only one proper 'clue' the type of camera the killers used is discovered and that's a a really weak one and b wheeled out in the first 20 minutes the rest of the so called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time br br seriously amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence before moving in for the final twist in tesis potential spoiler ahead the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas throws his hands up and says ok ya got me it was him after all as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes no such luck you're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after br br the only thing that drags tesis down further from just being a dumb badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous muddled up 'point' about violence in films i have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided confused psychobabble in between the rest of the gibberish and say look at me i'm political the final scenes in which the point of the movie is supposedly hammered home are so utterly absurd and puerile one can't help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this if he doesn't he certainly should this is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff br br overall i can't believe i wasted two whole hours it felt like at least six on this just hoping something might happen the urban legend of 'snuff films' and that is basically all they are despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films videodrome anyone but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if ' territory with it ie my little eye tesis hits an all time low for the 'snuff movie' genre on every level this one is better left dead and buried i'll award it a 1 out of 10 for some nice lighting but that's all it's getting
<START> this film is hilarious brilliant comedy but only because of one actor chris farley the best 'comedy actor' i have ever seen it's something special about him he is just so funny br br what a shame he is not with us anymore he will sorely be missed
<START> this was only the second version of the classic story by charles dickens i had seen and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst the film opens with a quick live action piece where simon callow as charles dickens begins the story of a christmas carol and then obviously it goes to animated story itself you probably already know it ebenezer scrooge is the grouchy cold blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates christmas he is visited by jacob marley nicolas cage who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of christmas past jane present sir michael and the silent future yet to come after all this he obviously realises the true magic of christmas and promises to be nicer in future the only changes i noticed to the story were scrooge having mice as friends a stupid idea scrooge's ex love belle kate winslet needing to see him to help at the orphanage the ghost of christmas present showing the two kids want and ignorance scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice and he's worried he can't keep his promise to stay nice also starring rhys ifans as bob cratchit juliet stevenson as mrs cratchit jones as scrooge's nephew fred and colin mcfarlane as the animation is not great quality the actors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage the only good thing that comes from this film is the good voice of kate winslet singing the closing song what if as for the rest it is just excruciatingly awful very poor
<START> i have always been a fan of this largely unseen filming of the gershwin opera since i last saw it in 1959 as many of you know it has been unavailable on video or dvd in fact the gershwin family sought to destroy all existing prints br br yet for some reason hopefully signaling an end to its opposition the gershwin family recently approved the showing of a collector's print at the museum of the moving image in astoria queens br br well the wide screen technicolor print was excellent not perfect but excellent the sound was outstanding in road show quality stereo the folks who saw this in its original release wouldn't have seen a much better copy the program notes include the original variety review which cautions that people might balk at the steep limited release ticket price of 3 50 br br and as much as i loved it originally and bess was better than i remembered it it's just wonderful sidney poitier as was at the point where his career was just beginning to catch fire and his charisma shines through dorothy dandridge as bess is spectacularly beautiful brock peters as crown is aggressively masculine pearl bailey as maria provides a few comic moments although her role is small and sammy davis jr as sporting life steals every scene he's in he's especially riveting in his two big numbers it ain't necessarily so and there's a boat that's soon for new york that last one won applause in the screening i saw br br and bess is set bound but it really doesn't matter when the set is as gorgeous as this one the costumes are also outstanding br br sidney and dorothy's singing voices are dubbed in but they are dubbed in extremely well the exquisite summertime is sung by clara played by a young diahann carroll her singing also is dubbed actually only pearl and sammy do their own vocalizing br br the music is sublime of course but what really struck me this time was how much emotion preminger got out of the story people were actually in the audience a number of times once when bess sings that beautiful i loves you and i got a kick out of the audience actually laughing out loud at the lines in it ain't necessarily so could it be they had never heard this song before or never really listened to it i believe that much of the emotional impact of this film is due to and performances you root for their love to win out br br a minor quibble with the 136 minute running time one or two slow spot and a stereotypical amos n andy kind of scene about bess seeing a shyster lawyer to get a divorce from crown even though she's not even married to him i would have cut that and the beginning is a little confusing both title characters are introduced awkwardly they're part of the movie before you realize who they are br br and i don't think preminger used a single close up in the entire movie it all seems to be shot in 3 4 which i'm guessing was his way of working with the wide screen br br and bess has always been a cult film for those of us who saw it for those of us who loved the soundtrack and for some of us who have only heard about it let's hope they find a way to re release this and put it out on dvd it deserves the widest audience possible
<START> can there be a worst film even ed wood at his horrific worst couldn't come up with something this bad cheesy stupid long winded preposterous and those are the good points i saw this trash back in the early 80's when i was incredibly bored to begin with and actually sat through the entire thing without blowing my brains out although that probably would have been a more pleasant experience i actually remembered it because it was so bad it makes me sad in a way because some of the best directors got their start by making tv movies ie spielberg and it was a wonderful way for them to get their initial material before the public but crap like this just totally killed the entire process
<START> there was a time in the us that everything was possible on film so came the movies containing horror and explicit scene's the best known are forced entry and but of course those were made with a bit of budget all shown on 42nd in ny but hey there were other grindhouses out there that showed no budget wet wilderness is an example of it it circuited the underground scene after a while so copies were available but as seen on other reviews some copies were abrupt cut at the end but the version i watched was complete well i would call this one more a porn one then a roughie there is a serial killer around but he likes more to watch others have sex instead of killing them when he kills it's done off screen the acting is the worst i ever seen and i guessed that the so called actors didn't like what they are doing for example in the beginning when we have the lesbian scene watch one girl stop performing and pulls a pubic hair out of here mouth then continues doing what was happening or when mother is riding the black man the daughter is sitting in the grass annoyed by ants but it is the storyline that made this one famous incest and racism is what this made it famous when there is blood watch the two girls sitting there waiting for a cue to act god this is worse but still one to have if you are into sleaze and grindhouse be sure that you have the full version
<START> yup that's right folks this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television if you want to watch a sad lonely and unfunny hack comedian attempt to entertain the masses with a half hour of pale and tired social ramblings that your mildly retarded cousin commented on at the thanksgiving dinner table then this might be the show for you this is billed as edgy comedy my friends but to be honest this makes tim allen look like richard pryor avoid at all costs unless you're a masochist
<START> having endured this film last night i turned off the dvd player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end throughout the film i felt that i was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local high school amateur society br br the only saving grace for this movie was that it had amy adams and harriet harris in its credits other than that it was pure dribble
