<START> all those who criticize the sopranos for its stereotypical portrayals of italians haven't seen anything until they've gotten a good look at this cornball gangster film which focuses on a family so irritating you almost want them to be rubbed out br br the parents in this clan aren't so bad but their two little boys one a total brat one cloyingly cutesy poo are insufferable while their older good for nothing son and pollyanna daughter ably compete for audience contempt but the granddaddy of them all is well granddaddy as played by chic sale in full mode he serves as the films moral compass throwing in lots of diatribes about dang dirty foreigners for good measure if these are the good guys it's no wonder the actors of that era who played baddies became the big stars br br not that there are any stellar performances to be found among the criminal actors but they at least acquit themselves better than the grating family the incompetent police officers aren't even given enough screen time to bring things down any further only walter huston as the district attorney elevates the clichÃ© riddled material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts br br the film deserves credit for being an early entry in what would prove to be a very popular silencing the witness formula and it doesn't flinch in its depiction of the hard bitten underworld lifestyle but there are quite simply better and less xenophobic examples in the genre
<START> good movie acting was terrific especially from and very well directed br br it also shows how was cornered by the belgians u s a and united nations and how they labelled him a to scare people as they did to all the honest true african leaders like and many others it shows how western countries preach democracy while they have something else on the back of their minds it is a story of injustice struggle and brutality br br it shows how couldn't control his people yes they were his people but before we put the blame on him was he getting enough if any from the people he appointed in his government like or his colleague had other things in their minds to find out go and see the movie certainly did went on to loot the country for the next 35 yrs before he was overthrown and fled the country died a billionaire br br some flaws there was too little explanation how the man got to rise in the first place also there should have been more explanation about the country congo after independence now known as democratic republic of congo formerly known as zaire when it was under there should have been an explanation why he couldn't keep the second largest country in africa in one piece and also what was going on with and just heads up if you gonna watch the movie was controlling the region which if i am not mistaken is the number one copper producer in the world br br in all it is a good movie to see you will learn something new about africa it's leaders and it's people and probably will open your eyes why this continent is ridden with wars
<START> i am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of christian fundamentalism br br that said this movie is reprehensible vile and transparent it only works on the level of the currently fashionable and tired hatred motif of white american christian fundamentalism had this movie been made about a fundamentalist jewish or muslim family or even a black christian family the outrage would have been palpable and the movie would have been roundly panned in all circles as it stands though it's ok and artful because white christian fundamentalists remain one of the last acceptable targets for garbage such as this br br and garbage it truly is if you want to see a quality film of a similar bent find and watch or review badlands nothing good was done in the king that wasn't done better decades ago in that masterful film br br as other reviewers note the characters are almost completely undeveloped in the king the lines are a snooze the cinematography is lackluster we've seen the tale of the sociopath done better 100 times this movie doesn't cut it for thoughtful viewers
<START> this is a funny movie there's not a lot of those ok the plot is a bit disturbing but very original a teen trying to get even with dad because he hasn't been around and almost sending him to jail because she lie to impress an older boy how could that not be funny plus it not the typical movie featuring teens first remake i've seen that is better than the original the only problem with both gerard depardieu with another actor this would be a perfect 10 because he plays all rolls the same way sucks another problem it's all the women melting over him that's not remotely believable he is not attractive y had a rubber troll that was better looking than him come on
<START> this is awful you just could't believe it the score is annoying the filming is bad for example sometimes you see the shadow of the cameraman appearing on some actors faces the quality of the movie is ultra bad seems like it was made in the it's terrible there is a bit of blood in the beginning and through the movie but always too dark filmed no gore no effects the director made some better one like blood rites but out there there is a following of the man 'cause searching to find this cheap flick isn't that hard but you have to pay hard earned cash for it surely this will get in my top ten of worst horrormovies ever i don't know if i would call it horror there is too much talking you will get bloodthirsty after watching it
<START> this is an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of ufo or space 1999 first series of course it isn't some sfx extravaganza or star wars pseudo mystic tripe fest but a subtle movie that has a slow pace yet it conveys the creepy eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best anderson productions for lovers of sci fi lynn voice is absolutely awful sfx are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home instead or do they ah every now and then peddled as the next gadget next decade' but still to happen 40 years later the device of earth's twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera tai 1969 so who copied whom
<START> well me sideways i haven't seen a home movie this bad since the abysmal 13 seconds or half caste someone should take away this guy's sony handycam this movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for 20 doesn't necessarily mean you should br br i remember that one of the things that robert rodriguez wrote in his book rebel without a crew was that when you set out to make a no budget feature you have to use whatever assets you have at your disposal rodriguez says that you should take an inventory of all the locations and props that you can beg steal and borrow from your friends robert rodriquez was friends with the mayor of some town in mexico so the mayor let him shoot all over for free what you got in el mariachi was a movie that looked like it cost much more than the actual budget br br i'm sure that the director of this movie has a copy of that book and he took that advice to heart in this case he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they put on a haunted house every year seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie but it's hard to keep a cornfield interesting for 90 minutes not a single installment of the children of the corn series spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one in north by northwest take a hint fella cornfields don't make for riveting cinema it would have been good if the director would have had more friends with more locations because this thing gets pretty tedious after the first 15 minutes this movie looks like it cost about 30 or whatever it cost in admission to the cornfield maze br br apparently he couldn't even find anyone to act in his movie so he cast himself big mistake here's a thought if you really want to make a movie get an actor so as far as assets go it seems like the cornfield maze is the only thing the poor guy had maybe he thought that was enough in fact i'm going to go out on a limb and say that i know he thought that was enough because the movie before it captured the coveted honor of being the sequel to dark harvest was called simply the maize the movie maybe this he's already planning the maize the musical or even the maize the mini series br br our jack of all trades and yes the master of nothing part of that saying is definitely appropriate here plays a psychic dad who can tell when bad things are going to happen think of the character from the dead zone but not anywhere near as good an actor as christopher walken or even anthony michael hall psychic dad has a premonition that his two daughters who are at the corn maze with mom are going to be killed he rushes to save them from that point on the whole movie is spent watching dad run around in a cornfield looking for his two daughters he finds the two little girl ghosts from the shining and he helps solve the mystery of their murder br br shot on a 200 handycam the director cast himself edited on imovie improvised story if that's not enough to keep you away from this a maize corny catastrophe consider this as a final warning the whole movie takes place in a cornfield boils and ghouls here's ghoulie guru's tip on how to save some money and still feel like you've seen this movie next time you see a cornfield stop the car take a flashlight and go run around in there for like 90 minutes
<START> the new voices scare me doesn't have to pass some academy to become emperor again it's the same thing over and over isn't it this is a kids' show right turns into something stupid like an animal he learns a lesson everything is the same david spade and john goodman never returned sniffle nothing changes 'cause disney won't do anything 'bout it it's probably one of the most retarded shows ever the first movie was so damn better probably the only person i like such a crybaby is retarded and retarded er if that's even a word what i meant to say is how could you disney why
<START> this movie is not worth a descend review it just made me decide that i am not going to go see the next tarantino film and i used to love tarantino's films br br not artsy not entertaining not witty not funny nothing just dull and stupid if this movie would have been first it would have also been his last br br tarantino has to get a grip on himself otherwise his next movie is going to be 3 hours of meaningless boring and uncool dialog it seems like he has fallen in love with his dialog and his love is blind br br after you finish your there's no reason to sit in a theater anymore
<START> h o t s is not for those that want hardcore porn instead this film is a precursor to many 80s era cult classic college frat films like revenge of the nerds and porky's and a post cursor to the world renown animal house a good time if you dig a lot of big titted 70s 80s playboy type chicks and cheezy slap dick comedy but nothing too notable if you wanna use it as whack material br br h o t s is an unauthorized sorority of sexy outcasts doing battle against the popular and trendy pi girls this one has pranks an aunt jemima ish house keeper and even an over heated robot that makes it relatively fun viewing if boobies are your thing br br well i like tits as much or probably more as the next guy but with all the sleazy sh t that i've seen i couldn't help but wish for a few hardcore scenes to make this one truly worthwhile i knew it wouldn't happen but i still wish that h o t s had a bit more sex and a bit less cheeze not quite as notable as nerds porky's or animal house but worth a look for fans of those types of films 7 10 br br p s and i forgot this one has consummate douche rag danny bonaduce in probably the best role of his career outside of his reality show
<START> i guess if you like snow boarding you may get some enjoyment from watching some nice scenery and some nice tricks but that is all the film has to offer the story line is non existent and any jokes that may have been in the film were not funny even on a sympathy level i also disliked the characters the main actor adam tried his best and for a comedy like this that doesn't have to be much but when surrounded by so many other bad actors he had no hope of making this film good but i shouldn't be too harsh on them for all i know they might have great skill but with a script that i could have written in ten minutes what ever skills they had were ran and hid for fear of appearing in this film my advise is don't watch it i wish i never did
<START> so many great actors so little worth watching but with a script that misses so much of what made the book special i don't hold it against anyone on screen though flawed the book was one of grisham's only that i truly liked especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town a slightly different world to a coastal such as myself i also loved the matter of factness naturalness of what occurs in the book in the movie characters are given a nobility of personality that seemed so stilted the villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional but as with so much of joel schumacher's work genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection so preachy stilted and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy i wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right
<START> i recently went to a free screening of soap girl where the filmmakers were present before the movie they around laughing taking pictures i was excited to see them dressed up in real life and couldn't wait to see the movie on the big screen br br during the movie the audience with laughter it was clear to me then that they weren't laughing with the picture but at the picture this is purely a grade b movie with no logic behind it throw in some nudity some blood and you have a movie br br after the movie i approached a bunch of the filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this movie they all acted so serious like they were serious filmmakers they each told me something different to make a controversial movie a funny movie an uplifting movie a socially responsible movie everybody mentioned something different it was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of movie they were making and they were now trying to recoup their money by this movie any way they could to get people to see it br br let me warn you don't buy into the hype unless you seriously have nothing else to do it might be worth a film student's time to study how a film should not be made otherwise you are better off saving two hours of your life
<START> this movie typifies the early eighties as well as fun i remember watching this movie on hbo when i was little and it was my favorite movie since it was a while ago no one i had ever met knew what it was then about the time my roommate had said she had seen it too and that it was her favorite they started to print it again luckily i have a copy now if anyone ever wants to see the greatest cheesy scavenger hunt that was probably the beginning ideas of hazing for frats this movie is it watcher has to have a serious love for cheesy 80's type movies
<START> bronson took the money and ran with this film he must have house payments like me this low budget film made in mexico reminds me of a few of those italians stinkers from over seas i heard i do not know if this is true but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes i believe this because why else would they make this film it sure wasn't to make money we had a whole lot of these canadian made stinkers because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry i wonder if it payed off in the other countries like in canada anyway back to topic this film is poorly made in every aspect i believe they grabbed charles bronson in order to sell this stinker that dead body at the end looks very phony 3 10
