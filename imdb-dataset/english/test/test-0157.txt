<START> the 08th ms team features two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict the zeon officer and shiro the federal new pilot meet in a battle in space throughout the 12 episode series and one movie the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them it features a romeo and juliet romance and unbeatable animation by far one of the best to hit american shores suit up
<START> in 1904 tangier a wealthy american woman and her two children are kidnapped by murderous desert pirates who scorn the moroccan government and by doing so kidnap american pestilence which attracts the attention of u s president theodore roosevelt fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert sheik films of the 1940s with a bit of the king and i interjected besides portraying the cloaked mustachioed bloodthirsty leader and his snippy haughty captive sean connery and candice bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp elements of their characters and dialogue and both seem singularly without proper direction the various and anonymous slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary we don't know any of these victims and the big action scenes become blurry noisy montages of sand swept violence on horseback the pluses a much lauded music score by jerry goldsmith oscar nominated but a loser to john williams' jaws fine location shooting and cinematography 1 2 from
<START> oh my poor jane must have done the old rolling over in the grave thing even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of mini series this is baaaaaad whatever else you do with austen the dialog should sparkle even in this perhaps her most serious work and melodrama should be strictly out of bounds alas not the case with this production by the time you get to anne's frederick frederick frederick you'll either be laughing or crying unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of austen's work you can skip this one if you do watch it however there are small the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles
<START> this film always hits me hard emotionally at the end though the issues of the film interracial romance and adultery were controversial at the time this film goes way beyond those narrow parameters of ground breaking novelty and trail blazing uniqueness here we have a true love story as written by the woman involved in this love affair told in a brilliant aggressive style that extols the virtues and glory of mad passionate love i love this endorsement of the only emotion that makes life truly worth living jennifer jones is full of grace and william holden is simply magnificent in his role as a reporter a wonderful film that only people who have been in this kind of love can really appreciate and understand and for those who haven't yet been in love even just the hope that one day lightning can strike for you makes life worth living because love is worth having even if but for a short time even if you lose because love is the stuff the essence of life this film works for me a warmly felt experience
<START> don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you you'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes however if for no other reason see greystoke to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role ralph richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle shakespeare rather he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed he was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor his reading of the part of the sixth lord of greystoke his last performance is to be cherished by all who love the theatre
<START> one of the most famous of all movie serials still interesting today although it does have an old movie look to it the second serial looks better but simply does not equal this one actors have a good time especially middleton and great editing by the universal expert crew the musical score was tracked in from universal's destination unknown the invisible man the black cat and werewolf of london and what great action music it was if there was a choice for all time best serial this arguably should be 1
<START> unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on my jaw dropped when i read the positive reviews of this film i cannot believe that this film was even released it's so bad br br i admit it is not my kind of movie but i tried to watch it objectively anyway you know so bad it's funny and was still offended at its sheer awfulness br br the acting is atrocious they can't have watched the rushes and i'm guessing there was one take per scene it really is that terrible it is the worst film i have seen in many a year in fact i wouldn't even call it a film it's a tragedy the gay black friend whom no one actually calls gay it's just implied because he's so crazy homophobic this is not good in fact this is downright vomit inducing the jokes die on their pathetic arses the music is so bad it defies belief the person who compiled the soundtrack essentially chose the most ear bad songs they had ever heard and put them in this waste of film stock oh my good christ i can't believe the 80's produced utter garbage like this i grew up through them and i cannot find one thing worth of note here it must have been a dark time to be a cinema goer br br if you even contemplate watching this film go see a psychiatrist he will then accordingly slap you you sick sick person
<START> but not this one i always wanted to know what happened next we will never know for sure what happened because gwtw was margaret's baby i am a lifelong fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more repulsed by the movie i did compare scarlett to the original gwtw because any film worth following gwtw needed to be on the same quality level as the first rhett was cast beautifully although no one will ever compare to mr gable i am also a strict vivien leigh fan she was scarlett she fit the bill not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with scarlett the job could have been done better not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett that was evident br br overall something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and rhett i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction this movie is not worth the time
<START> i have used this movie in my college ethics courses for over 10 years also woody allen's crimes and another terrific multi leveled ethical study br br it's fiction i don't focus too much on the unrealistic features of strangers because all fictional films are obviously false on many levels i love the film as gallows comedy tautly told with many ironic twists and visual pleasures even if it's unbelievable the story is told so well that i don't even think of criticizing its plausibility although i must confess that the tennis match seems the weakest part to me too much hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition br br some problems presented in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and ethical discussion br br 1 ethical passivity some weaknesses of the guy character are intended by hitchcock a primary ethical insight of the film is the danger of inability to articulate one's moral positions guy is unable to effectively block bruno's crazy proposals at the start an interesting question is why and how does guy behave so passively ineffectively a possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process br br 2 miscommunication guy commits another failure at the start on the train to get away quickly he agrees that bruno's ideas are all good but guy's literal meaning is opposite to his inflected sarcastic meaning bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss cross murders guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement to some extent near the beginning bruno may be partially pretending that an agreement has been struck to draw guy further into a web of complicity bruno is manipulating guy guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives bruno a chance to put an ethical on guy bruno manipulating guy may also take on other meanings br br 3 secrecy some have speculated about a sexual relationship between guy and bruno it seems at first ridiculous especially since guy appears obviously heterosexual in his relationships with miriam and anne however remember that guy is also ineffective with both women guy appears stereotypically it's 1951 remember effeminate especially in relationship to bruno guy the strong athlete is weak on the inside bruno is also conflicted playing against himself appearing facially and physically strong at first but then displaying some effeminate traits bruno's fashion and footwork his gushing emotionally to guy in different situations his receiving a manicure from his doting mother bruno kissing and desperately fondling his mother's hand other more subtle gay stereotypes that hold cryptic meaning from hitchcock's point of view i wish i could hear hitchcock clarify his intended meanings here br br 4 dishonesty and distrust guy makes some colossal blunders in hiding truths about bruno from family and from police guy fails to fully comprehend that admitting fault quickly may be better than a cover up or a delay in confession again guy is driven by passivity insecurity fear and perhaps a self hate that is closer to bruno's own self loathing than we care to see or to admit both guy and bruno act out their own parables of impotence br br 5 lack of evidence guy feels a problem the evidence to acquit himself while quickly going to the police would solve a huge problem guy traps himself with his own doubts and insecurities the absence of desired alibis the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on guy's behalf the obsessive need to appear politically pristine and other personality factors that cause guy to feel defenseless he is as dysfunctional as bruno just not as dangerous yet one could partially blame guy for murder br br 6 disease and mental disorder an interesting question is how legally responsible is bruno for the murders the more ethically incompetent bruno is as a sick sociopath the more guilty guy may be as someone healthy who failed to stand up and morally act to prevent the crimes guy's failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and death ensues one could argue that more than one crime is committed and that guy is an emotionally hobbled accomplice br br these and many other features of the film make strangers on a train a gem of a morality play a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections
<START> an example of all of the worst gay stereotypes all in one movie br br and charles why do you speak in that weird pseudo british high brow accent and insist that the kid speak that way too did anyone else notice that all of the soundtrack music is exactly the same you should stick with the good old hollywood camp drag stuff that you are so good at die mommy die ii the sequel i don't see the value of spending time and money on a project like this there are so many real life gay youth stories to be told and we should be seeing those not this garbage sheesh what a waste of time embarrassing example of gay cinema
<START> far from combining the best bits of and 28 days this managed to ignore them whilst shamelessly copying them if that makes sense was different and got progressively this just stinks the radio dj we must stay on air spends effectively no time on air he sits on his bottom and watches the tv for news this is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever is there a single person in the usa or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is or ever heard of the word zombie well by the 50th minute this bunch of misfits are still calling the zombies the infected ones or the ones with the word zombie might make a guest appearance later i could care less maybe there's a copyright where you have to pay to use certain words like the bluetooth earphone is called the ear thingy i kid you not to finish no plot no acting no one cares a waste of time a shameless poorly executed rip off
<START> i don't think i really have any spoilers in here but since i do describe a couple of funny scenes i'll check the box saying contain just to be on the safe side now br br i hardly know where to start by now you know the basic outline of the story horse traders travis ben johnson and sandy harry carey jr take the job of guiding a mormon wagon train west to their land' and along the way encounter a variety of trials and interesting characters most notably the outlaw clegg family br br anyone can enjoy this movie you don't have to be a fan of westerns to like this one for one thing johnson and carey are two of the most quickly likable characters you'll see in any movie carey in particular is animated and outgoing almost like a big kid while johnson is a little calmer and wiser kind of like an older brother figure i get a kick out of the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their horses' for ten dollars then inform him that the horse has some peculiarities you might say failings travis elbows sandy who lets loose with a shrill whistle sending the sheriff's new horse off on a wild bucking fit with him in the saddle the look on his face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is priceless br br pay attention to the music even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the sons of the pioneers listen to shadows in the dust as the wagon train is shown in motion with some of the people walking along between the wagons it's a truly beautiful song too bad only half a minute or so of it is in the movie i want to hear the whole thing sometime br br one thing that impressed me greatly about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as hard to make as the real situation it portrays teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails straining to make the top this was no simple and easy film it must have been risky for the actors the stunt people and the animals as well rivers too this movie has plenty of authentic looking action involving the movement of the wagon train it should be mentioned that both harry carey jr and ben johnson were extremely competent riders both with many years' experience riding and doing all manner of cowboy type things carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many indians and in fact he learned to speak before he learned to speak english no cowboys in this movie travis and sandy were the real thing through and through br br watch for the scene when miss denver throws out the pan of water from her wagon hitting travis's horse in the face the horse starts bucking eventually throwing him off it watch the look on sandy's face when denver tells travis 'i'm sorry you fell off your horse ' another favorite scene of mine is when harry carey jr sandy gets into a bit of a tiff with one of the mormons they're working back to back getting their gear ready and after sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow the two of them get into a rear end bumping match that quickly turns into a rolling around on the ground fist fight even after the elder ward bond stands them up and separates them the two combatants continue trying to get at each other the mormon named 'jackson' in the film gets one final kick in at sandy so high it hits his shoulder it's a really funny scene from start to finish br br i don't know what else i can say about this movie other than that it has a good story very engaging characters beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humor and a bit of drama oh it has been colorized at least in the version i saw not the most beautiful color film you'll ever see but i think i prefer it to black and white i give this one a ten and i don't give out many 10's one of my favorite movies without a doubt and judging by the other comments i have plenty of company in that assessment
<START> watching this movie and then listening to the commentary it's clear that michael radford doesn't understand this play the first clue that he fails to fully grasp the work is that he takes pains to set the film in seventeenth century venice which sounds truly odd yes that misunderstanding the film would mean trying to make it as accurate to its location as possible but anyone who's studied shakespeare knows that while he set most of his plays in exotic locals the culture and values are always contemporary england this doesn't hurt the film but it displays a lack of necessary knowledge br br where radford kills the film is in making it so dead serious he manages to suck every joke out of the script leaving the whole production flat every ounce of passion is beaten out of the characters even 'do we not speech is a mild awkward ranting from a choleric who seems to only be saying and doing what he does because he's supposed to the lovers are solemn and far too restrained joseph fiennes delivers some of the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in a barely audible whisper who has to promise to behave at one point is more sober and collected than who makes him promise to behave jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with lorenzo pouting br br in the commentary for the bland and watered down court scene the director voices his shock that an audience laughed at 'a pound of flesh no more no less' sentence ultimately concluding that it had to tension release laughter 'the merchant of is a comedy and radford scoffs at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical portions of the story are anything but the most daringly provocative drama br br the film has no intelligible focus yet cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes the characters are forced into high drama veils so they come out sounding like ibsen characters reading victorian poetry and the comedic ending where all of the good guys go to bed happy is drowned in a dignified despair that feels like they're finding stiff upper lip peace with impending death rather than reconciling with lovers even lancelot and antonio exit the film holding their hats like aristocratic mourners br br the film is poorly done because the creative powers that be don't understand the script it is stern where it should hysterical it is reserved where it should be passionate it is michael radford where it should be william shakespeare
<START> now the television schedules in england at least are crammed with home improvement bargain hunting house hunting and cookery shows in the afternoons the chances of any of the terrestrial broadcasters digging out a complete obscurity like this to occupy a couple of hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are slender to say the least but back in the eighties the bbc did just that and guess what i watched it and it's a testament to the overwhelming weirdness of this hungarian american co production that i can still remember large chunks of it over twenty years later to begin with the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening titles only to vanish again for at least half an hour imagine an american tail re edited so is nowhere to be seen and you'll appreciate how confusing this is there's a supremely bizarre bit of animation where one of the characters gets his elaborately waxed moustache tweaked and stretched complete with a sound effect that causes him to go boss eyed probably hilarious if you're stoned but to a child quite disturbing speaking of which the infamous scene is represented in an abstract manner clouds in vague hippo shapes are struck by lightning but it's still pretty unpleasant in fact this film is pretty cold and uninvolving throughout a sad state of affairs hardly helped by the strange looking production design all muddy colours wobbly lines bloated forms and that uniquely european bleakness reminiscent of jan svankmajer only not as compelling then to cap it all we get songs by the this isn't so much an awful film as a deeply misguided one not so much phantasmagorical as a rather bad trip
<START> i really don't know why i agreed to watch this movie but like a complete fool i did and for that i deserve to be shot i had seen the original killjoy well i say i have seen it i started watching it but found it that bad that i ended up watching it in 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue but i said i would watch it and i did even if it was in 4x speed br br to cut a long story short killjoy 2 kicks off where killjoy left off by this i don't mean the plot i mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheapness i have nothing against low budget movies in fact i kinda enjoy them they are something different from mega budget blockbusters but this film is just terrible the acting is diabolical and the script well i think you could of given stevie wonder a pen and paper and he would of produced something much better this movie is just annoying not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has which is so obviously dubbed i didn't make it through this movie anyway about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window it may of been a rip off to buy as a dvd but as a frisbee it was a mega bargain br br please for the love of mankind itself do not watch this muck it is possibly the worst thing i have ever seen and considering some of the muck i've seen thats saying a lot br br my rating on this movie would be nailgun to the head 10
