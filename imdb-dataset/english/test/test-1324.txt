<START> child death and horror movies will always remain a sensitive controversial combination and therefore it is my personal opinion that every movie that shows the courage to revolve on this topic should receive some extra attention from horror fans of course like in the case of wicked little things controversial themes don't always guarantee a good film despite the potentially interesting plot the atmospheric setting and the involvement of video nasty director j s cardone the slayer this is an uninspired and clichÃ© ridden film that couldn't offer a single fright or shock after losing their husband and father the remaining women mother karen and her daughters sarah and emma move to a small and remote mountain town where they inherited an old ramshackle mansion their new home is dangerously close to the old mine ruins where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913 strange things start to happen like young emma befriending an imaginary girl who used to live in their house and the eerie locals seem to keep secrets from karen and her daughters quickly turns out that the undead children still leave their mine graves at night to seek vengeance on the descendants of the mine's owner mr carlton who was responsible for their deaths wicked little things is rather tame and extremely predictable the script shamelessly serves one dreadful clichÃ© after the other like car wheels stuck in the mud at crucial times flashlights and horridly broken dolls there's very little suspense even less gore and the make up effects are disappointingly weak the zombified children don't look menacing at all actually they all look like miniature versions of marilyn manson with their black outfits pale faces and dark eyes the excitement free finale is stupid and just as derivative as the rest of this pointless production lori is thoroughly unimpressive in her leading role as the mother but scout taylor compton currently a big star thanks to the halloween remake and young chloe are adequate as the daughters
<START> shame shame shame on ua dw for what you do br br i was appalled br br do not take kids to see this movie the humor is totally inappropriate for children plus they'll be bored and disappointed certainly we all have read theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations but this is pure trash dr seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his thumbs up at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic br br what a pity br br spend your money on the book if you own a copy then buy the book and donate it to a toys for tots program this movie is not worth a free ticket viewing br br stick with the book the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal save your money seriously save your money it will be on cable by saint patty's day br br shame shame shame on what they do
<START> just do a little research on the making of this film something so simple as a google search it was funded by the us army and promoted just in time for the elections it is a great idea but i'd much rather see a documentary not something edited by the bush administration and told its reality the timing of the movie's release its tone and the fact that ms l promoted it raised questions about the intent of the movie according to ms l managing director joe gleason he and his colleagues also deliver key targeted messages about the war in iraq to specific wrote eartha was the left leaning art house crowd one of those is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to the u s population nobody involved with the film is willing to say who initially put up the money for the film or how they ended up represented by the army's pr firm
<START> the first users comments are very detailed for a very vague movie not saying that i disagree but this summary can be written in a few sentences to get straight to the point this is pretty much like watching the making of a really bad amateur porno flick there are a few funny points in the movie but with the kind of things that happen in todays youth everyday its actually kind of lame the main actor in the movie is a pompous jackass and both guy and girl in the film are way too modest to be in a film like this do not waste your money on this movie the only reason why i gave it a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least a somewhat attractive girl in the movie and towards the end you got to see almost full frontal nudity from the girl thats it thats the only thing thats worth watching it for the end
<START> akin's prize winning 2004 movie head on gegen die wand depicted the appealingly chaotic world of a self destructive but dynamic turkish german rocker named this documentary is an offshoot of head on and explores the range of music one might find in istanbul today if one were as energetic and curious as german avant rock musician alexander of the group who arranged the sound track and performed some of the music for head on and had the assistance of a film crew and turkish speakers provided by director akin you get everything from rap to the most traditional turkish classical song with rock kurdish music and turkish pop in between it's as chaotic and open ended a world as one where east is east and west is west but the meet br br like istanbul itself which sits on the edge between europe and asia and brings the two worlds together while remaining sui generis this is a that includes turkish pop turkish traditional songs kurdish laments roma jazz musicians and group of street lively and offbeat shots of istanbul street life and some talk on camera about synthesis and some personal and musical history by singers and musicians working out of the grand hotel de in quarter where stayed at the end of head on while looking for his beloved roams around the city with crew and equipment interviewing people and recording their music br br he begins with some loud rock by the neo psychedelic band baba Â these are musicians he bonded with while putting together head score and he stands in here for the absent bassist and by turkish including brave female rappers Â thus causing some oldsters to walk out of the theater early on and miss the predominantly tuneful and easy to listen to sounds that makes up the bulk of the film head narrative excesses were tempered periodically by musical interludes performed by a traditional turkish orchestra sitting outdoors on the other side of the gives us the opportunity to meet and hear performances by some of the best known living turkish singers including a lady in her late eighties whose aging elegant musicians remind one of the way the great egyptian umm used to perform gets songwriter movie star to do a striking solo on the long necked he's written all his songs on and persuades the now elusive great to do a special performance of one of her most famous songs memory of istanbul this is a coup and so is the lament by a beautiful kurdish recorded in a bath whose acoustics are spectacular if only they could have turned down the heat Â singer and musician's faces stream with sweat there is also a young canadian woman brenna fluent in turkish who sings turkish traditional with expression and fervor the sound mix is of high quality throughout one would like to see a sequel many great of turkish popular and classical music have necessarily been left out br br film released summer 2005 and shown at festivals in 2005 and 2006 opened at the film center in new york city in june 9 2006
<START> you expect it to be juvenile but you at least expect a complete and coherent movie what a waste i am extremely disappointed not at just having watched a bad movie but at having such a great concept be tainted by a common movie that we've all seen before if this crud makes 1 over its budget the studio would be wise to declare victory round up all available copies store them deep within the nuclear waste repository under yucca mountain and then never make another movie like it again most of this movie will keep you thinking this is not what i wanted to see this film appeals to the unintelligent and maybe to teenagers it's a true shame because most movies are made for that demographic i had much higher hopes for this film
<START> i do love b horror films i however am generally not a huge fan of so stupid it's funny films i had to rate this so highly simply because death bed the bed that eats is so one of a kind and so original there are plenty of question marks plenty of plot holes and the wtf factor is cranked up to 11 but i was really not bored for a second i really couldn't call it creepy at any point every minute i was saying to myself what the hell is this bed film going to do next i watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or b movies and even she was pretty into it the effects were actually very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were quite good it keeps a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film albeit an incredibly ludicrous consistency and the acting wasn't terrible i can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief damn near impossible but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that that fact didn't really bother me seriously for me this film hit that realm of one i will not only never forget but i guarantee i will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future does anyone else know of any other films in the inanimate objects that eat people genre totally fantastic
<START> this was the first mickey mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound in the cartoon mickey does not yet wear gloves he does not yet speak either all he does is whistle and play music the song that he plays is turkey in the straw using several farm animals as musical instruments for example he plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls nursing piglets like an accordion keyboard i taped this cartoon off of the disney channel and i think it is wonderful it was based on a silent film starring buster keaton entitled steamboat bill jr
<START> i would rather have someone cut out my eyeballs with a razor blade than have to watch this movie again i watched it from start to end thinking it couldn't get any worse but it did the writers and producers should be slapped for putting this kind of crap on television the actors are all terrible get out of hollywood you fools and go work at mcdonalds sweeping the floors and emptying the trash anyone that thinks this movie is even remotely decent should be hung they are an embarrassment to humanity to think we have soldiers putting their lives on the line for anyone that produces this kind of inane garbage makes me embarrassed to say i'm an american
<START> this is a family movie that was broadcast on my local itv station at 1 00 am a couple of nights ago this might be a strange decision on the part of the schedulers but the real howard is a rather strange film strange in the way it doesn't want to upset its audience come on there's nothing kids like more than sadism and that's why roald dahl was such a popular author for children it also explains why doctor who was such a successful show across the world in this screenplay you're just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesn't happen i'm not advocating child abuse but to see howard lose his rag at the little ones would have made the movie rather better can you imagine how much worse kindergarten cop would have been if the producers had gone all pc i mean if you're making a movie centered around a children's author who hates children shouldn't the story show and not tell br br much of the problem lies with director jean and you do get the feeling he doesn't know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie as someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and kelsey grammar is very wooden i guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show he's famous for but it fails to work here and there's many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distracting but at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities
<START> summer of my german soldier was one of the many tv movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s others were brian's song sybil and someone's watching me it portrays a jewish girl kristy befriending a german pow bruce davison in wwii era georgia one of the things that the movie shows is that many of the german soldiers weren't really nazis but were just drafted watching the movie i got a real sense of how things must have been in the south back then i mean can you imagine being a jewish person accused of supporting the enemy br br so i certainly recommend this movie i believe that it's always important to show the things portrayed here occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full scale masterpiece but they usually do quite well i hope that the movie eventually comes out on dvd also starring esther rolle and michael constantine the my big fat greek wedding patriarch
<START> i love oddball animation i love a lot of asian films but i didn't love this particular product of japan the are supposedly an american family they're all mannequins who have moved to japan and they're somewhat a 50's sitcom type family with slightly more modern sensibilities at times the dvd features several very short episodes like less than 5 minutes each and i did not find it to be either funny or entertaining not even in a weird way i'm not sure what the appeal is of this i did pick up on some satire here and there gosh who wouldn't but satire is usually somewhat humorous isn't it and nothing i saw or heard rated even a little smirk i picked this up used and it certainly sounded appealing but i guess either i'm missing the point or it's just plain lame the box even says it's hilarious right there on the front but i beg to differ 2 out of 10
<START> this is a poorly written and badly directed short film pure and simple what is interesting and keep me watching to some extent was the production values shot on video it appears with a bad script and bad direction one would think it would also have horrible production value that is what the viewer expects when they watch a film that is terrible and shot on video but not in this case they spent some money and it shows it keep me very mildly interested to see what was coming next just to see br br probably the worst short film i have seen that looked big budget hollywood even though it was shot on some sort of video format br br instead of spending the sum of money they must have spent for some rather impressive set design it would have been nicer to see a better executed story with some good direction but then again how can we expect new filmmakers to do this when even hollywood won't
<START> i loved this movie to be very fair the movie starts off very slowly with none of the characters being terribly sympathetic it continues in this way for a good half of the film br br but if you're patient you'll be greatly rewarded what the first half of the movie lacks in character development and or sympathy is adequately compensated for in the second half it's a bit like riding a roller coaster a slow uphill climb to off with and then speed twists and turns and a few surprises br br as usual meryl streep is wonderful she is the finest actress of our time william hurt is good if a bit wooden in spots renee zellweger does a very good job showing that her performance in jerry mcguire wasn't a fluke
<START> to be entirely frank the popularity of this show saddens me inuyasha is certainly not terrible it has a few good moments the occasional flash of clever humour and unlike so many animes dignity however it is utterly lacking in the essential elements of a worthwhile story from the start its premise dooms it to be stereotypical the main plot centers around collecting the pieces of a shattered jewel before they can be possessed by evil and is as one would suspect a totally generic epic fantasy affair the story follows a familiar pattern of fighting off various enemies for pieces of the jewel and is thus quite predictable lacking in complexity and easy to lose interest in but as so many animes have shown a poor premise can be rescued by deep realistic characters sadly no one rescues the story of inuyasha the main character is the stereotypical anime heroine and far too reminiscent of akane the main character of the original comic author's previous work ranma 1 2 she is kind to other females but treats many males especially her love interest with unfair unabashed unjustifiable brutality inuyasha is a tough on the outside but sweet on the inside type and is the lamentable stock character of the pervert br br the flaws continue with what happens to this plot and these characters namely nothing despite constant action the story does not progress despite regular romantic moments neither does the main relationship despite ample time the characters never really change and to add a cherry to the sundae of mediocrity all this stagnation is stretched into approximately 150 episodes br br my final criticism of this anime is the animation while certainly not ugly it displays almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators the animators seem to take joy in long scenes of inuyasha jumping through the air with wind whistling in which they have little to do but move a background br br in short with all the beautiful animations of the world at one's keyboard perched fingertips there is absolutely no reason to watch inuyasha
