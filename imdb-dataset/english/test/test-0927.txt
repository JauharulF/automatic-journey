<START> caution spoiler at the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured the impression is that the attack was all for nothing in reality taking the bridge at was the last important victory for the western allies it was the crossing of the rhine that the allies had been trying to achieve for six months because the bridge was taken the war ended in just a few weeks br br the bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured this was enough time for the americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side and they could then start building a series of bridges the taking of the bridge was a complete success and meant the that the end of the war was near and would not last through the summer contrary to the cynical nature of the film the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it they knew how vital the battle was br br this film has little to do with real history it was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced
<START> you'd think a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually murder their employer couldn't help but be gripping but then you'd be wrong br br there is no plot there is no character development there is no redeeming visual beauty br br this movie is a waste of time the exploration of how the relationship between the sisters develops is nil their sexuality is never anything but a grotesque the class relationships are glossed over and employer is a silly caricature br br ponderous silences and period clothing do not equal depth of meaning
<START> this as the first of the ma and pa kettle flicks marjorie main ma steals the show in anything she does funny to see ida moore as emily the daffy old lady on the train god she was always old she was in desk set and alfred hitchcock presents their new house is also a co star here its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that pa doesn't care for love the painting gag keep an eye out for tom he starred in nanny the professor unfortunately he died real young oddly enough his last role was on the series death cruise weird directed by charles lamont who not only directed several of the kettle films he also did a bunch of the abbott and costello flicks so he must have known a thing or two about comedy fun story plain simple humor even the release date was april fool's day 1949 the story starts out by showing us what backward and country folk they are the neighbors are even native americans but as the story progresses we have sympathy and respect for them
<START> this was a movie of which i kept on reading the reviews again and again and despite it being played at film museum and not at pathe theatres Â i decided to give this movie a try the reasons were many Â in the reviews it was compared with pulp fiction it had several parallel stories running in the movie and lastly it had already won 17 awards internationally in various categories i was eager to see this movie and due to my off day at i decided to make myself happy by going and seeing this movie br br it is a story based in finland i think it reflected the current life of people in general Â drugs crime sex anger anguish fear and guilt every emotion was captured brilliantly in the movie there are several characters and stories interwoven but a few characters come back in the latter half Â making a link with the beginning sequences and that takes the story forward br br the story is about two friends Â one of whom is computer geek and the other is a drug addict Â son of an abusive father the drug addict boy trades a euro 500 note Â printed by his friend Â to buy back his music system and in returns gets huge change of cash back to buy more drugs the trading of euro 500 note continues to bizarre events Â from the shop trader to an auto mechanic cum robber Â to a car dealer Â to a vacuum cleaner salesman Â to a prostitute Â to a police officer Â then to her family and children how the beginning of a small thing Â creates a chain reaction that lead even after 5 years of that first incident to a depressing last note Â which i won't reveal here br br the direction is excellent the character development in the movie is first rate the character that sticks on your mind even after you come out of the movie is of the vacuum cleaner sales person all the departments of the movie are handled nicely here i would like to make a couple of critical comments first during the sequence of one event leading to another i felt that the coincidences were too rapid and forced but this screenplay writing error is pardon when one sees the whole canvas second the trail of one character leading to another somehow leads back to the first two characters and that again i found to be a forced decision by the screen play writer there was no need to have the same characters showing up again when there are different causes leading to different effects in such a big city br br but after saying that Â it is an excellent movie it is a dark movie with quite a few sex scenes the characters are having the black white and gray shades and emotions that change from facing different situation which is brilliantly captured by the director br br a top rate movie it has all the ingredients of becoming a cult movie i hope that only such movies should not become and achieve the status of cult movies and win lots of awards because without crime sex violence drugs etc too one can make fantastic movies Â bicycle thieves and are its prime examples Â only thing is that they were a long time back and times are changing and i think movies are reflecting the current times
<START> really disappointed me i can't consider it as a bad movie but the development just seemed too rushed and non believable for it to evoke any emotions dr displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from i mean how many times does he ever have a conversation with maybe once also never appeared to be a real character instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie or else another title was needed some of the best acting came from a role that wasn't really important to the story that of the sub intelligent yet humble drunkard of course the scenery the cultural tidbits of the canary islands and other wow moments were interesting but the movie fell short of a documentary in case this was its real intention and most importantly as a solid drama
<START> john travolta reprises his role as chili palmer hollywood gangster who now turns his eye to the music business using his negotiation skills he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend played by uma thurman and try to get his young singer christina a hit record br br before i saw this sequel i had heard that it was a terrible film however be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original the movie focuses on the music industry this time around instead of the movie industry the music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes i can't tell if this was the intention or not since get shorty did a nice job of spoofing the movie industry the same can't be said for the sequel and the attempts just come as lazy br br an impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking the best performance is given by the rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role vince vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end surprisingly uma thurman gives an average performance and i was expecting more from her john travolta returns as chili and he does an okay job his performance is kind of dull though christina gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer cedric the entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long there are also a bunch of cameos including steven tyler and james wood br br f gary gray directs and he does a poor job he just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess there was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile also at minutes the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots the film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't fortunately for the film the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes sometimes the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny compared to the original the sequel doesn't measure up well however be cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy in the end be cool is worth a rental and that's it rating 6 10
<START> this show had a promising start as sort of the opposite of 11' but has developed into a shallow display of t a actually according to my little brother thats the only good part of the show br br the first season was by far the best it was new and interesting things just went downhill after that the only redeeming point of this show is the other actors are lack luster the characters lack depth and they seem to be incredibly selfish nd generally un likable people br br to quote a friend las vegas is like in a casino in my opinion thats way to generous baywatch was way better and much more realistic
<START> great characters great acting great dialogue incredible plot twists in plain language one of the best shows i've ever seen in my life do yourself a favor and watch this show you won't regret it this show re writes the book on sci fi
<START> the cookie cutter gets to work overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story the plot such as it is has been done before a trillion times so there is no need to recount any of it suffice to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make a face even the soundtrack is awful its not that i dislike figure skating although i don't its that i dislike cliched bad movies
<START> inspired by true events radio is one of the best acted heart felt dramas i seen widely released in sometime it definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003 br br radio stars ed harris who is oscar worthy nonetheless in this film as football coach harold jones coach jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game however coach jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by debra winger and sarah drew one day radio played by cuba gooding jr in his best performance since men of honor comes by the football field while the coach's team is practicing for the game some members of the team then tie up radio and throw him into a building they then bang on the building and finally coach jones suspects something is wrong he comes over and helps radio who is frightened and from that point on coach jones and radio shares a very special bond radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events he also becomes coach jones's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and radio br br the movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life accepting people for who they are even if they are different death and family relationships the movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director michael should be very proud of this film the thing i liked most about radio was how real it felt the performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes radio had a great mix of comedy and drama some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad br br in conclusion i feel that radio was very overlooked by critics only getting average reviews they must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me also the performances as i mentioned before are top notch and oscar worthy in my opinion both ed harris who i think is underrated as an actor and cuba gooding jr should both get some kind on nomination for this movie radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies my final rating for radio is a 9 10
<START> my family watches this movie over and over even our 3 year old loves it i like the goodness in the movie giving the stranger a chance showing goodwill to one obviously in need of some unconditional acceptance the movie gives a feeling of goodwill and victory one other aspect of the movie that makes it so appealing is the personalities of siblings the bird lover the bug lover the boy lover very cute and happy movie there is one thing however that is irritating about it that is how mrs brown often makes mr brown look foolish or unwise she at times comes off as a know it all and he as a dimwit which he is not too bad to put that into such a nice story nevertheless we will continue to enjoy this wonderful old movie
<START> this movie is just crap i cant put it differently since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap br br the story dialogue acting special effects make up pretty much everything sucks i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing i can't believe how somebody produced this thing br br it's not even about vampires it's more about a dream reality experience the development of the movie is incoherent the motivation of the characters is doesn't exist everything seems like a big joke maybe that's what they tried to do but i sincerely doubt it i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired it's definitely one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life and i've seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this please make yourselves a favor and do not watch this br br p s it's also full of clichÃ©s p s 2 bad script bad directing bad cinematography p s 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone
<START> dear mr ram gopal varma i don't know in which capacity i am writing this letter to you i am a never say he's finished amitabh bachchan fan having sat through his cock chasing act in i also demand some important designation in the godfather fan club having watched the coppola classic more times than you have delivered flops from your factory and of course i have been a big admirer of yours right from the time you had wrapping the cycle chain around his knuckles in shiva br br when you announced sarkar and called it your take on godfather all one wanted to know was the date the first look would be out the sunday the promos would go on air the friday the film would be released it was sheer wish fulfillment at work knowing that you and not someone hovering between the mustard fields of and the tulip gardens of amsterdam had taken up the task of recreating the puzo pages on the bollywood big screen br br your cast couldn't have been more you Â working for the first time with the legend casting abhishek as his screen son giving kay kay a role he has deserved for years bringing back forgotten faces like and and picking complete non actors like katrina and to join the before july 1 you had made sarkar the most awaited film ever for any godfather freak who worshiped bachchan br br the opening credits stoked the hope that your stunning sepia tinted promos on the telly had kindled but now you labeled sarkar your tribute to godfather instead of the word inspired which you had been using all along probably you don't want the two creations to be compared but when the medium is the same then a kaante would be compared to reservoir dogs and a reservoir dogs to a city on fire br br also when your first and last sequences Â the heart of any screenplay treatment Â are all about the establishment and the transfer of power you can't keep the and the apart even if you replace the american mafia moves with maharashtrian political power play br br but you got it wrong mr you wanted to show amitabh in his 70s avatar as up by the pens of you wanted him to lurk around larger than life you wanted him to be his own brand o then how could you steal his voice in the name of using silence how could you keep him rooted to his chair in the hunt for interesting camera angles how could you leave him stranded without his voice and stature the two things that have made his b so big coppola's godfather cameraman gordon willis masked brando's eyes throughout the movie because it didn't have the power to match that drawling husky voice or that sudden snap of the fingers but you tried to repeat the malik act from your very own company but bachchan is no ajay devgan Â his forte doesn't lie in the stagnant stare and the suffocating silence you made the man look like a comatose patient who's reminded from time to time to look at the cue cards and mouth those predictable one liners for that there any given saturday br br which bachchan fan would go and watch kay kay menon stealing the thunder from under his nose in the scene where sarkar asks to leave his house which amitabh aficionado would go and watch him focus on and in a film that talks about power with a capital p in the promos we can't handle so much in the name of restraint and understatement you don't even allow the camera to rest on him for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him give me the old school camera only on bachchan style any given saturday br br kudos to you of course for making an actor out of abhishek first in and now in sarkar you also allow him to show mallika that he can run as well as his father even in the short prison sequence you really make the come out of the text an opportunity missed in aur wish the film could have been more a father son story rather than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of characters who pop up like the ad windows on the internet br br you also let the women more into the script than puzo and coppola did and again you deserve all the brownie points for squeezing them in so effectively is a welcome return as the mother in the middle lovable as the lovelorn girl katrina a revelation as confused lover and silence speaks volumes br br but sub plots do not a classic remake when your free flowing camera tries to make every frame look and your loud background score irritates incessantly we keep getting reminded that we are in a factory well maybe not a nino score but sarkar certainly deserved better than those govinda govinda chants and uncalled for flute interludes br br mr varma some of your factory directors tell me that you are involved with every project from overseeing the shooting schedules to supervising the editing sessions perhaps in the middle of all the various storyboards the bhiku scream is being muted by the silence perhaps you need to bring the down on the factory and work on a single homemade product otherwise your products would remain products to use and throw not treasure and movie buffs like me for whom there are no hits and flops only good cinema would rather choose a film without factory finish any given saturday
<START> endearingly silly anime only six episodes in duration about a hapless delivery boy called kintaro well he's called a delivery boy though he is meant to be in his 20's and the adventures he has on his travels each episode sees him arriving in a new town acquiring a new job developing something of a love interest before each episode ends with him leaving br br gently sexist juvenile very immature at times this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on the face br br not one to start with if you are not a fan of anime as this certainly won't convince you about the genre but for those who are already converted this is entertaining fluff
<START> one of master director alfred hitchcock's finer films this is the story of an american and his family james stewart doris day and their young son who are vacationing in north africa stewart is a doctor and day is a world famous singer they meet a frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus later one the frenchman whispers something into stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying the rest of the film is a puzzle as stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery the movie is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences you never really know what's going on in this film why people are appearing until the end and even then you're not sure the final scene takes place in albert hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934
