<START> i watched this movie or part of it in hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was but it soon became clear that this was just plain silly for one you have the worst acting ever the lead actress nielsen is terrible uninspired and hardly even attractive and she certainly do not look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings butt but she does and whats with the feminist attitude it's plain hypocrisy for one her family was killed by a women then she joins some warrior school or something so she can learn how to fight men she then joins up with a fat servant and his child king whose city was destroyed by those two characters are just plain stupid and destroys the little of atmosphere that the movie managed to create after this i could not take any more of nielsen painful acting and the stupid clichÃ©s and lack of some real action br br schwarzenegger as was the only part of this movie which actually made it remotely watchable br br i liked the conan movie but this is pure crap
<START> this is a delightful they don't make em like this anymore kind of film well performed by everyone and peopled with interesting character actors an intelligent witty script acted with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor holds up for repeated annual viewings br br warning the re make of this film with the same name directed by arnold is an unbearable mess painful to watch without a scintilla of the charm and wit of the original
<START> okay sure this movie is a bit on the hokey side it's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility dolph lundgren as the punisher anyone but this tries very hard i've never read the actual comic book but that doesn't really matter i suppose i judge a film mainly on its merits not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea unless its a film based on a true story that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating because it tries it tries very hard in my book that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film br br many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus it seems everybody has their take on vampire lore be it the cross the silver the garlic the aversion to sunlight whatever some of those ideas are included here the storyline is familiar a group of vampires conspire to take over the world with one person mainly standing in their way blade wesley snipes lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses who have slowly but surely moved into the world and share it with humankind for the most part the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them the vampires have even taken familiars people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turned br br now that i think of it there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the roddy piper film they live a hidden enemy hidden group of people plotting against them the fight to save human kind all that is present in blade as well br br the acting isn't the best here snipes is at best only slightly better than some of his other roles wright a relative newcomer isn't too bad kris kristofferson is forgettable as blade's sidekick he's to blade what chip is to the punisher stephen dorff does the best job of the whole cast here as the head vampire you just love to hate br br i don't know but i just loved the special effects in this film from the blood soaked vampire style rave all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film the special effects aren't half bad there's certainly enough blood and gore to go around but after all this is a vampire movie right the various shapes and sorts of weaponry blade uses are fairly unique and not generally used in contemporary action films snipes has more flair with a decked out sword than he does with say a machine gun plus there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away unless of course you are indiana jones br br overall this isn't the best action film ever made but it's not half bad either as a bonus the musical score soundtrack are pretty cool too tell me in what other movies can you hear super like source direct or br br my rating 8 10
<START> this little known comedy from the hit play by ruth gordon is a delight the script based on the play is spicy rich and completely undated ditto the cast but i must underline the work of the leading lady irene dunne irene is simply superb as usual and lights up the screen with every frame she's in and she's in it a lot thank heaven in addition director vidor has given her some unusual close ups that are mesmerizing what a gal i know of no other hollywood actress from any era who has her versatility and is so convincing in every film why she remains so little known is a mystery i have seen most of her films and this one was a surprise even for a solid id fan like myself see it everyone
<START> just got this in the mail and i was positively surprised as a big fan of 70's cinema it doesn't take much to satisfy me when it comes to these kind of flicks despite the obvious low budget on this movie the acting is overall good and you can already see why pesci was to become on of the greatest actors ever i'm not sure how authentic this movie is but it sure is a good contribution to the mob genre
<START> writer director patrice takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject friendship and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce despite a list actors fine cinematography and elegant production design it's all in the plot and the plot is laughable teach me how to be likable art dealer franÃ§ois daniel auteuil tells a random stranger boon and that about sums it up we learn next to nothing about friendship and daniel auteuil may be a fine actor but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut throat egoist the script depends on him to be just as we hope the travesty is over pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts fast forwarding from damage to disaster like treasured greek vase everyone and everything in this movie is a fake only asset is julie in the part of business partner catherine looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut
<START> it's always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat prophetic for the future of an actor in this case i was intrigued by edward g robinson's statement to barbara stanwyck i promised you the valley as he discusses the lone hold outs to his attempt to control all the land in ten years later stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the barkley family on the big valley somehow i thought she might have looked older in the earlier picture i guess all those bright gowns and fancy riding outfits have a way of bringing out one's youthful side br br as for my summary line above that's lee appraisal of john parrish glenn ford one of those hold outs mentioned earlier shortly after parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to take out a number of hands after they raid his ranch and torch his home i liked the way the film explored his character starting with the way he dealt with foreman wade matlock richard jaeckel in a calculated showdown the set up for the ambush was also a clever maneuver diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bad guys head on with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing for that parrish also had something to say never meet the enemy on his terms br br the violent men is a good title for this film and was probably at the head of it's class in the mid 1950's though by today's standards doesn't come close to the blood letting one will find in a tombstone or open range where the bullets exact a nasty savagery but it's shaped by fine performances from the principals with a sub plot exploring infidelity that seemed almost ironic considering it was stanwyck's character who was cheating
<START> if you want to see the true vile nature of communism watch the movie dark blue world svet it recounts how the brave czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to england to join the fight against the nazis after the war the communists feared they had picked up dangerous western ideas about freedom so they had these heroic czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison where some of the guards were the same nazis they risked their lives to defeat br br if hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat they should compare the character drama portions of pearl harbor with this movie in dark blue world you really make a connection to all the characters in pearl harbor everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person br br there are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie one funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character karel is being taught english by a rather formal englishwoman when he can't pronounce a word he ridicules the lesson in typical stoic english fashion the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts karel and shames him into behaving br br the aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing and they help to keep the movie lively i read that it cost 11 000 an hour to rent the planes but it was worth every penny br br ladies you are expected to cry at sad movies but guys beware this movie would make general patton weep and if you are a dog lover you'll use up half a box of kleenex don't say i didn't warn you
<START> this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen br br i hated it so much i wanted to come here and complain about how bad it was normally bad movies are no big deal but something about this one if you hated it you really hate it br br if anyone liked this you probably enjoyed baby geniuses i thought i could never find a movie that was worse then that one i guess not
<START> the slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights there was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger but it was a good start for all that as is now common with this doctor the moral ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage they were always there in the classic series but they were a side issue to be glossed over when the doctor was in the heat of battle this regeneration even says sorry to a during the battle this episode finally shows mickey embracing the heroic side that had been hinted at in previous episodes his journey from zero to hero is complete and it has been an utterly convincing one with scares humour and scenes that brought a lump to your throat this episode had everything after much consideration i can finally say that the new series betters the classic series in every single respect coming from a die hard you can get no better recommendation than that
<START> this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen me and my husband own over 600 dvds most of which are sci fi and horror b movies that aren't top quality but still entertaining dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities at all the writing was horrific and the acting was even worse it took us a 3 tries to get through the entire movie because we could only tolerate it in 30 minute intervals we thought surely it must get better we were wrong i would rather watch a corpse being embalmed than to have to sit through that again when it ended me and my husband just looked at each other like uh is that it the ending seemed like there was supposed to be more but they ran over their apparent 500 00 budget and were like oh crap we are broke end it now quick roll credits
<START> i was ready for a crouching tiger style movie and all i got was the worst movie i've seen in years it was almost as bad as baron von dead script dead acting dead everything br br granted there was some good fight scenes but the positive side ends there if this movie arrives in your house run to a phone and dial 911 and say please help there is a movie in my house meant to force people to commit suicide
<START> inane awful farce basically about a young man who refuses to conform or better uses non conformity to attain his objectives fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a college truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to after viewing this junk you will see why br br what a ridiculous name south hampton institute of technology you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the initials of this school of nonsense problem with these type of films is that in the end the non conformist becomes the accepted mode br br let's step back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is excessive manipulative junk
<START> this film is bad it's filled with glaring plot holes characters who are ruled by stupidity bad acting and above all a poor script which has been done before in many many films only better i feel sorry for donald sutherland i just hope he had to do this film rather than wanted to miss it
<START> so udo kier earned like nine bucks and free food for this so that is a victory in and of itself br br more importantly this movie tells a very interesting tale about a group of salvage guys coming across the broken down i should warn you i'm gunna bounce around through this review real quick so buckle up first thing's first coolio plays a guy named likes drugs finds a bunch of caskets on board and now i don't know anything about the future but maybe they smuggle drugs in caskets not gunna say that was the craziest thing in this movie later on the vampire gets out of his mist filled coffin and then the real hilarity begins first although this movie has the word dracula in it he is actually not in this movie i have a theory though out of the blue you see the salvage crew's ship leave without them my theory is that dracula was on board with his retarded brother dracula told he'll be right back dracula got the hell out of this movie before he could be seen leaving to play the vampire for the six or so minutes he is in the movie the best part of this film and for those of you that have seen this you know what i'm gunna say is after gets sired embraced whatever he has this huge monologue about ejaculating on various parts of erika body and other super cool stuff coolio seriously you are the best thing ever br br some other stuff happens in this movie too like casper van dean gets some work screams a lot and loses his arm and then we kinda lose track of him for the rest of the movie and thank god really we find out erika's character is a police bot as the movie comes to a close we find out that the ship is on a course to ram into the sun the police bot and one other surviving character are doomed rather then avoid certain death erika's police bot reveals she's also a whore bot and they decide to screw each other and die before they die in the sun they die for no reason yep that's right their ship blows up for no real reason br br this movie got the amazing rating for one reason coolio my god if they gave academy awards to black rappers then he'd be the first to get one the only reason this didn't get a perfect ten is because there was not a drop of nudity now i know what your thinking how can you judge a film by whether ladies show their goods or not well easy a movie like this pretty much requires it its part of the process gore gore monsters nudity gore end of movie final shock at the end its the formula this had some gore the monster was awesome because he sucked so hard he actually did us the favor of staying off camera that was considerate of him and i respect that nudity not a drop even though there was a length conversation about well see the above statement and as for the shock twist i certainly didn't see the end coming that counts br br i hope hollywood doesn't think coolio gave this film his all and has nothing left he deserves more work well until dracula 4000 i'm out
