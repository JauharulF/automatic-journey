<START> i like tom hanks and he is one of few actors who will draw me into the theatre regardless of any misgivings i may have concerning the film i worried about mr hanks return to light comedy as this is the arena where he made the transition from tv to film remember big well charlie wilson's war is not light comedy it is political satire and extremely well written political satire at that the script is the star of this film and the word by aaron is some of the best on offer this year br br mike holds the entire escapade together delivering a film that zips along in a very quick 90 minutes timing is everything in comedy and nothing is ever funny if it drags choice in sets and lighting are also very reminiscent of '70's and '80's tv a move used deliberately to root the piece in period br br the return to the use of model work and stock photography over digital special effects also enhances the retro look and believability note to the production designers in your choice of stock footage i know the difference between an f 16 and a and a bell and a hind but that may have been part of the joke too br br i saw this film in philadelphia it was interesting to watch and listen to the audience not get the historical references to their own history history tends to repeat because the have forgotten what happened the first time around br br kudos to both mr hanks and that chameleon phillip seymore hoffman script is brought to life by these actors and the entire production team is on the top of their game br br heartily recommended
<START> this film is a study piece for my english class but it's depth and meaning has amazed me since we're looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film its and interesting tale of love hate war and prejudice well recommended br br story a girl named well off jewish patty bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war she then hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens and as they get to know each other they begin to see the others qualities and they earn each others love patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt anton the prisoner of war almost blows his cover to protect her but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone
<START> this moving was intriguing and absorbing however the story was a little choppy and hard to follow at times although the two principal actors did a great job just seeing penn acting with every fiber of his being and stealing every frame made this a very memorable movie later movies have revealed him to be a not just one role actor he also showed comedic flair in sweet and lowdown surprisingly talented and not the light weight i used to think he was
<START> it is is very sad to see someone of the calibre of george c scott in a low budget thriller which would have been better if the original novel was written by graham greene and directed by someone somewhat more experienced in the genre not to mention a better cinematographer there are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and carnival merely glossed over rather than captured to locate the movie solidly in the exotic setting of the novel br br elsewhere in the viewer comments on this site one very astute observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this film ever since i saw george c scott as rochester in jane eyre i have prayed for him never to ever accept again a role which required him to assume a british accent just every now and then he could just possibly pass for british or a very british sounding south african played obviously by an american actor i can stomach meryl streep's extraordinarily laboured accents both british and australian at least she gets it right even though with every utterance she demands that we marvel at her skill well i am sorry that mr scott is no meryl streep and it just destroys the illusion like having michele yeoh speak excruciating mandarin with a strong singaporean accent in crouching tiger etc br br peterson acts no differently than what we see on csi except he is still very handsome and more or less slim in this movie he is the harrison ford of tv same old expressions for every emotion every situation no on second thought ford has two perplexed pained and happy i have never seen a smile on mr csi
<START> naruto the anime tv series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies and a third one is coming our way this summer br br the first one which was released in the summer '04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of naruto in an exciting adventure however one must be a blind deaf and one legged chicken to deny that film's faults whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable there were a lot of things that could be improved on naruto movie 2 however takes all of these aspects and excels upon them br br the action first of all was incredibly cinematic the lighting setting and style was three fold as effective as in the first movie in the first we were given basic action well animated and choreographed animation but nothing eye popping however this movie's cinematography was exceptional the use of shadows and lighting combining together to make the action all that more intense was very effective and added to the force of the fighting br br the animation was very good it rivalled disney however since this is a movie about tv characters there was nothing about the character design or detail to the actual characters however the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic i think they even used twice the amount of cels for each second because there was absolutely nothing jittery about the animation at all it was incredibly fluid br br the music i think that's where this movie fails the original composer conductor for the tv show was used for the film and i don't really feel that he did that good of a job the music mostly reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old games the composer is very good but the used for the film couldn't convey the tune very well however they didn't fail the film at all adding as a good accompaniment to the action but except for a few violin string pieces towards the end and some choral work the music didn't excel any boundaries or act as anything special br br the story was fun it was a reasonably typical storyline for naruto and was very similar to the first movies except again it took everything that had been wrong with the first film's story and improved upon them the characters were a lot more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the entire film it kept making you think the film would be ending any second now but then it would move on but instead of feeling dragged out the action and characters made everything still feel fresh and exciting br br overall this film is a but however good it might be it is most definitely one for the fans i enjoyed the film but thats because i'm a fan but i can see just like with final fantasy's advent children it doesn't excel as a movie but merely acts as a fantastic serve of fan service for a good hour and a half though i think this film does act as a good introduction to the series for current non watchers it won't give a full effect for anyone other than those glued to naruto screens however despite all this it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of upsetting fillers
<START> i like noel coward the wit i like noel coward the play write i like noel coward the composer and singer but i loathe noel coward the actor br br to me this is a man who should have stayed firmly behind the scenes writing his plays and composing his music and making his profound and hilarious observations he should never have been allowed in front of a camera br br make no mistake he is one of the top outstanding talents of the 20th century but the man just couldn't act and his voice with it's rolling r's and it's overly round tonal quality well it could quite easily grate cheese in my opinion br br this is one of my least favourite offerings from coward as he unconvincingly portrays a psychiatrist embarking on an affair with a much younger woman made worse by the fact that the much younger woman is an old school friend of his much younger wife br br celia johnson is as much a joy to watch as ever as cowards wronged wife it is her performance that saves this film from abject dullness i suppose her own little fling in coward's brief encounter four years previously qualified her for this role as she must have raised a few eyebrows playing a such a promiscuous woman and this gave her the chance to win back a few fans and gain some lost sympathy br br she was such a wonderful actress and you can see why noel coward used her so much in many of his productions br br however the rest of the film is drab badly acted predictable and on the whole boring to almost arse clenching level br br if its noel coward you want then take the time to watch in which we serve blythe spirit or this happy breed instead three noel coward treasures with lovely films like these i suppose we can forgive him for this turkey br br i have given this four stars purely for the addition of miss johnson but on the whole i'd avoid this one like the plague
<START> during my struggle to stay awake during this borefest i fought through my near off to discover some silly plot regarding fraternity schmucks quite incredibly obnoxiously annoying running into trouble with a psychotic damaged half human half cyborg named splatter who sends his soldiers after them for the murder of their prestigious politically vocal leader for whom splatter killed himself setting them up to take the blame so he could become the leader these face painted freaks form a group who express their feelings though non violently living on dilapidated streets abandoned by the civilized world voicing their concerns regarding nuclear disarmament anyways most of the film has these five frat goons running throughout darkened streets with graffiti walls as splatter and his punks pursue them thankfully for these guys they find a punk chic to assist them on their journey out of this rather ugly terrain with which they're this territory the frat guys are immersed is a veritable labyrinth of streets and alleys with the idea of an exit out most difficult particularly when crazies and bunch occupy nearly every turn br br yeah i was duped like others thanks to the hr giger poster which is most excellent if only he had been the designer of this dreck this is not the case and we the viewer are left a film modeled after of all movies it seems walter hill's the warriors except this film doesn't have the style or grit that film has the film has a plethora of unfunny bits and lame confrontations between the frats and the punks with hand to hand combats often laughable the setting is rather interesting and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light but it's not the environment that's the problem it's the plot and characters within the environment that grow tiresome the under my eyes weighed heavier every minute this movie continued yes texas chainsaw stars edwin neal quite a funny voice man who has an entertaining interview on the dvd i rented for this flaming turd of a film and marilyn burns have key roles as opposing members of their faction against the government resulting in the final conclusion within a building complex at the end character splatter uses these metal spikes which emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims
<START> the only good either of the problem child films caused was bringing together amy yasbeck and the late john ritter aside from that the flicks are as demonic as their hero in this basically unnecessary sequel freshly separated ben ritter and his little hellraiser junior michael oliver who never needs screen time ever again move to a new town infested with willing ben eventually picks played by the most underused original snl er laraine newman whose blanche dubois tendencies don't suit junior in the least to add on to junior's torture it seems this town already has a little firestarter in younger girl form with trixie who coincidentally has a sweet single mother played by yasbeck the same actress who played junior's first horrible mother through adoption you can see where the plot goes from here searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth so i guess i'll go with the cherry bomb in the toilet gag that makes back to the future's james one of the many grown up victims that guy's always playing school authority figures jack warden and gilbert gottfried return as their parts from the first film but sadly there is no appearance from the bow tie er i mean killer michael richards that made problem child all the more fun on a serious note i'm sure these films whether abusive parents saw them or no did wonders for the red headed children of america let us also salute these proud american flicks for their terrific promoting of adoption oh and dog poop jokes gotta have dog poop jokes
<START> the happiest days of your life showcases some of britain's greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upper class twit like fashion generally it is a whistle stop tour of stuffy english behaviour with the girls only school providing a great setting for the dotty goings on margaret rutherford alastair sim and most especially joyce are all fantastic giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with as the film moves on things get sillier and sillier with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably crackers high point br br at this point i will give special mention again to joyce and her wonderful character miss she is so extraordinarily innocent silly apologetic and ineffectual that she seems to steal the whole film she provides the greatest laugh of the film when she flirts with a male teacher call me sausage br br whilst some of the film is slow or dated and not always very involving it still maintains most of its sparkle and barely pauses for romance good for a silly harmless giggle br br 7 10
<START> i wholeheartedly agree with greg in ontario i saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager afterwards and told him that was possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i have seen a lot of movies with this person and he's pretty forgiving so i was actually shocked the manager gave him a free pass br br i was offended by much of the humor in the film yes the baked potato scene was on the top of the list my friend and i are white and saw the film with a primarily black audience for awhile i thought maybe i just don't get this movie because i'm white then i realized no one was laughing the writing was bad the direction was bad the timing was almost non existent br br there were a few funny moments there was just way too much time between them even airplane two was funnier than this and that's saying a lot br br i was so dazzled by snoop dogg in starsky and hutch as huggy bear that i felt i was sure to enjoy this movie nope br br was funny as usual but his role was rather small tom arnold had a few funny moments as the white guy but most other attempts at humor fell far short of the mark br br sadly i was not able to award this film a rating with negative stars
<START> hilarious clean light hearted and quote worthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble br br the clichÃ© characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst harold and andy tennant make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies dressed up as hari dancing chanting and playing the tambourine unbeatable the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless br br a word to the wise if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do you've gotta play
<START> ok we have 4 city electricians who find a mini nuke reactor turn it in and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spider queen also from a parallel universe who managed to slip through with a few of her kin to take over the earth but alas she is the only one left if so why did not the rest of humanity join up and hunt her down also what happened to the military no way a few billion plus round of ammo could have been used up and why hide out in a basement when a lot more defensible places had to available also not a dig on city workers but how is it they knew what a mini nuke reactor looked like and how if they did not have one in the parallel universe could they reopen the rift sorry but there was nothing likable about the movie
<START> ed coincidentally an editor is hired to cut horror films down to be favorable in europe where standards are much more rigorous but he finds the films very mind destroying and starts going a little bit mad okay a little bit might be an understatement br br let me just say this first of all best opening scene ever a man in an office who blows up his head with a grenade his boss then says with a straight face you're fired the entire film does not keep up this level of intensity but it certainly tries br br take the shotgun scenes the decapitation the clips from lost limbs which my friend jason wishes were a real film the writer of this film thought up the idea of a woman who gets raped by a beaver and then immediately after gets shot in the face with a bazooka that is something you won't find in any other movie at least i'm pretty doubtful you will br br this film's biggest flaw is the quality the picture isn't as crisp as a 1997 film should be and the sound could be touched up though it's not bad i thought i was watching a 1980s film although that gave it a bit of a boost in my mind the film also had the 1980s style of writing and directing in it a sense of fun and giving the audience a little something extra over the top i do miss those days br br i wish i had more to say though at the moment i cannot think of anything strong enough to praise this film i do think you ought to see this you've seen the box in your video store with the ax splitting the head maybe you've passed it up a few times maybe you thought it would be cheesy pick it up savor it
<START> this film is so bad i mean who commissions this stuff and the costume designer deserves an award for making everyone look like they had just stepped out of 1983 a bloke puts a female wig on and fights nuff said
<START> i've seen a few of mr boorman's movies and didn't like much of them not that they are bad movies quite the contrary are good movies but not content i personally found entertaining however i think where the heart is although made to cater to the less than art savvy american audience is masterful as satire and as social commentary of the times it was made in i've had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times since every time i loan it out to someone i know could appreciate it's artistry on all its levels my copy fails to come back home to me lol the last time took 7 years to replace it since it was out of print for vhs sales has never been made as a dvd that i know of and had to wait till one of the premium cable channels ran it before i could tape it again br br my favorite aspect after the nail on the head social commentary is the paintings by i've searched for 15 years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them i have a room in my house that i dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book or video aquarium or as a documentary of her work if anyone does know of where i can acquire any sort of copy of work or where her studio is in england please do not hesitate to contact me via email
