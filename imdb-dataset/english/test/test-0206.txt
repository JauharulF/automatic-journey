<START> my brother in law and his wife brought the movie over one night to watch on video this should have given me the first clue that it would be horrible it was from the very first frame to the last this movie is terrible it does not even quite register as a b movie maybe an n or a p one of the worst 5 movies i've ever seen from the rubber raptor on a stick to the still breathing corpses in the car to the beyond horrible closing lines this movie isn't worth watching if you've received it for free br br skip this one altogether unless you want to play mystery science theatre with your friends it will provide good ammunition
<START> the first shiloh film was enjoyable by adults as well as children this one starts with about an hour of filler where not much happens with stilted dialogue only in the last act is there any significant action that really moves the plot along the dog is still cute though and young kids may enjoy it
<START> heart of darkness movie review could a book that is well known for its eloquent wording and complicated concepts ever be made into a movie good enough to portray the deep meaning in the book so far that goal hasn't been achieved the heart of darkness was attempted to be made into a movie in 1993 but it was a failure in comparison to the book br br it is hard enough to make any book into a movie there always is the worry that it won't be as descriptive or have the same meaning so why the novel the heart of darkness is made into a movie i am clueless there is so much description and hidden meaning throughout the entire book when just reading the words plainly i think that a person would think it is pretty boring and wouldn't get the symbolism i think that is what happened in the movie the movie just skimmed the story at the surface br br the movie didn't even follow the full storyline of the book major changes were made that i thought made the movie worse for example the manager did not go along on the boat with marlow and the rest of the crew the spy did instead i think that took out some major plots and took out the great deception of the manager in relation to kurtz also kurtz wasn't even on the steamboat when he died which especially made the entire journey even more futile which just got annoying after a while and when marlow was telling fiancÃ©e about his final moments and words it was no where near as descriptive or important the fiancÃ©e didn't even get that upset br br as far as the acting went none of the actors did a very good job except for the actor that played in my opinion kurtz was not very evil and that was kind of an important thing in the book also other characters such as marlow the manager and the fiancÃ© didn't do the characters justice that they deserved from the book their acting wasn't very exciting or memorable at all over all i don't think that this book should have even been attempted to be made into a movie i think it is fine to use some of the themes in a different story line like in apocalypse now but as for following the same exact story line of the book it just does it shame
<START> was struck at how even the acting was throughout william haines had an acting range that is wonderful for silent film not over the edge there are moments where the camera work is most excellent and combined with the story like when he is waiting to see the superintendent very well done br br thoroughly enjoyed the flick br br
<START> apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer alun this film is not worth seeing br br the storyline is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what is going on at any given time and just when you think you're following then the direction changes again like a lost bi polar puppy dog br br the musical score is awful relying too heavily on extremely emotive pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way as if the instruments were acting as an emotions queue sheet Â 'feel sad here' 'feel shocked here' 'feel scared here' on top of that the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter br br gone are the days of silent film where musical instruments were the sole portrayal of voice Â but you wouldn't think so while watching river queen br br the voice over was so over utilised that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story br br and the stolen ideas from jane campion's the piano are too obvious to overlook not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano Â perhaps some of this comes down to alun camera work on the latter Â but the voice over feeling and levels too are strikingly close and who could forget when holly hunter's character has her wings clipped in the form of her index finger being cut off by sam neill does it remind you of when has his amputated and surprisingly too with an axe i thought so br br all in all i cannot recommend this film for viewing unless you wear some ear and just go with the scenery in mind
<START> this is another of eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue action and a dollop of romance along with the gauntlet and so forth clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar in this one he's taciturn and a bit outrageous especially with women and superiors there are no surprises in his performance but the film itself is something of a surprise it's above average br br clint is frank a secret service agent who perhaps in a moment of doubt failed to catch the bullet that killed jfk he then took to drink which drove his family away and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by john calling himself booth who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability now this is rather an set of attitudes for a performer like clint to project but he does rather well less robotic than usual and he does seem to carry around with him like a burden of stone the memory of that moment in dallas he's tested again halfway through this movie he is hanging from the roof of a tall building grasping booth's hand and he pulls his pistol and points it at booth who asks him if he is really willing to shoot if he does of course he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a cia trained murderer but he does so at the cost of his own life booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair and clint even has a short speech talking to renee russo about his failure to save the president in dallas if i'd have reacted quickly enough i could have taken that shot and that would have been alright with me it's underplayed but his voice chokes slightly his eyes water and his lip it's one of the few scenes in any of clint's films that might properly be called moving we know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time the irony is that he doesn't like the current president who could he gives pompous speeches in colorado about how they carved a nation out of the wilderness didn't they do the same thing in las vegas br br it's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain it isn't true nothing is that simple but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case the reptilian john with his eyes is marvelous br br talk about disillusioned okay he can ham it up a little sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes but he's fascinating on the screen renee russo has little do to fred thompson as the chief white house aid is now back in politics a relief for movie goers if clint's acting range is limited thompson's is something less in every film he's been in he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder br br the direction by wolfgang peterson is as good as it was in das boot which is pretty good there is a great deal of the usual suspenseful cross cutting in the final shootout and when clint and russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor not only the usual garments but handcuffs guns palm pilots dick tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta interrupted clint lies back on the bed and sighs now i have to put all that stuff back on again br br well written and worth watching
<START> i've got 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects plot is choppy and very predictable most of the actors seem like extras with no experience everyone has scottish accents it's like watching a crew of from star trek without the personality or charm needless scenes of people putting up tents tents with all of the supposedly high tech equipment actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them nothing to make you care if these people survive or not looks like it was made in someone's backyard and garage using low end equipment nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining do not waste your time
<START> i believe anyone who enjoyed ivan the terrible movies would enjoy this well crafted movie this movie played out like lord of the ring return of the king but without the special effect but as good and better drama br br we have the german who dressed like kkk conquered of russia the russian summoned nevsky to lead them to fight the german to save russia nikolai who played ivan in the ivan the terrible films was charismatic as nevsky the first 10 min how he handled the passing by mongol was captivating br br many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white the anticipation of war did not require any dialogue such as how many enemy we will be killing etc except for a few speeches the film can basically be played out as a silent film the fighting scene can hold up to those of the civil war fighting scene of the birth of a nation br br another strength of the movie is the great musical score by sergei the music gave an epic feel to the movie in those scenes without dialogue
<START> who could have thought a non disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film probably someone but no one truly no one could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film br br michael steven robertson lives in a home for disabled people he has cerebral and as shown to us right at the beginning he has huge trouble communicating so it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member rory james mcavoy who can speak normally understands him thus starts off a friendship that relies mainly on ironically enough communication br br in a hilarious scene they manage to move out of the home into their own after rory had been rejected good hearted michael put forward an application to move into his own house rory who already had a bad name with the judges was to be his interpreter br br but troubles soon come about they begin good heartedly stalking a girl who they met in a pub a while back wanting her to be their assistant to do the little things that matter she at first is reluctant she does not know these men but seems they could be harmless so strikes up another friendship but not necessarily a good one br br as well as being poignant however this film really does rely on the actors but that isn't a bad thing for a non disabled actor you see rory though he can communicate properly frustrated at the way he's completely dependant on other people and has no real life of his own but the real star for me is steven robertson he acts with such emotion yearning to fit in and sadness happiness that really sees him win over the whole entire film br br excellent br br overall 5 out of 5
<START> i only watched the first twenty minutes of this movie and personally i think that this is the worst movie to be made in the recent years br br the plot was so bad that it might have been possible that a 10 year old kid wrote it the acting was also sloppy with pretty much an unknown cast and not only that the action sequences especially at the first half of the film were so terrible it was unbelievable br br i don't know how the producers obtained the budget to film this movie but the production company must be regretting it by now br br to anyone who may come across this film in the near future i advise you to steer clear of this joke of a movie
<START> shadow magic' recaptures the joy and amazement of the first movie audiences it also shows the power of film in its ability to bring the world a little closer overcome cultural barriers and to preserve ourselves for generations yet to come certainly anyone who truly loves the art of the motion picture will enjoy this film it's a great first effort by writer director ann hu who will hopefully have many films to follow
<START> yeah i guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of pam grier's other films the plot is overly familiar the dialog stilted and some of the acting isn't too good but it's worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film where we see ms grier in a sexy blue with the zipper half yeah it seems like a frivolous point when discussing an actress of pam grier's talent but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman and back in the day she had a body that wouldn't quit it's nice to see it being showcased in a tight rent the dvd and then tell me i'm wrong can't can you that's because you know i'm right and yes i really did give a 10 just for the scenes
<START> early coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see a pity there's some wonderful things going on in this one shirley knight's best performance an underrated actress a road trip in the late 1960's james caan very restrained and moving robert duvall in a part he was born to play edgy lonely motorcycle cop and a touching script with f coppola behind the wheel br br if this had been made five years later by some nobody it would have been a smash so much for timing anyway i recommend this to all people who don't need outer space explosions and bad mother in law jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold give this one a chance if you can find it
<START> if daphne du maurier had set rebecca in 1950s san francisco it might very well resemble this uptight highly unusual noir from robert wise valentina cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and insinuates herself into the life of richard who happens also to be the guardian of the dead woman's son it's absurd and over the top but also entertainment cortese is terrific slowly falling apart as she realizes the mistake she's made is fine if a bit bland although the lighting toward the end makes him appear very menacing fay baker makes a very good mrs danvers like caretaker wise is a fine director and he keeps things moving at a pretty brisk clip he also stages a now classic out of control car crash with cortese or at least a stunt cortese at the wheel
<START> four holy young men from mormon country go to l a to preach the gospel to urban heathens but one of the young mormons is a repressed gay who happens to cross paths with a very out young l a party boy what would film plots be without coincidences these two very different young men become friends and in the process affect each other's outlook which in turn sets up an inevitable clash between gay and mormon cultures br br that is the premise of latter days a 2003 film written and directed by c jay cox himself a former mormon missionary the film's story is of course highly relevant especially in contemporary america variations of this story need to be told and retold and retold hopefully in future films because the underlying theme brings to light the hatefully superior attitude that christian fundamentalists too often display toward gays by its nature latter days is provocative and i doubt that the film was well received in provo or even though the script is intelligent sensitive and insightful
