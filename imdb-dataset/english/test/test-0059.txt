<START> i actually was looking forward to this movie after reading a number of reviews before the release it sounded like a genuinely nice film one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast nicholas cage penelope cruz and john hurt br br well it might have been all of those things but it is so boring that i defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention also cage's attempt at speaking with an italian accent is embarrassingly bad he's such a good actor that i cringed every time he spoke in this film br br seems to be the most often word used by reviewers here to describe this film and i totally agree br br i guess it didn't take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because like cage's accent it did not do well
<START> this movie about a group of small town teens that decide to rob the local bank is excellent brian justin walker wants to get out of his small town much like jimmy stewart in it's a wonderful life however unlike george bailey brian is going to rob a bank to finance his dream of attending art school even if his father is not supportive the offer to brian is to act like a customer and distract the guard it's a tempting offer that if offered to many i question what they would do anyways brian does it when the sheriff james remar and his force surround the bank things go from bad to worse it's a standoff with even the feds moving in to kill the kids if they have a clean shot the sheriff must prevent this and try to end the standoff in a peaceful way unfortunately tensions rise and the teens inside turn on each other some are out of control the paper cutter scene is gruesome and hard to watch very intense
<START> this is one of the most awful movies i've had the misfortune of picking up don't get me wrong i love a good zombie flick but this wasn't one of them br br might as well from the opening scenes at least been called zombies from outer space' it had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or the video game as far as i could tell br br the best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can get covered with so much blood and remain so nonplussed i would certainly suggest giving this one and miss and staying with a safer zombie pleaser like '28 days later' or 'dawn of the living dead' the remake of course unless you're into some serious campy action
<START> like many people in my general age range i remember going to see this movie as a kid in '98 and coming out of the theatre practically in tears it seemed at the time to be one of the most important awe inspiring cinematic experiences of our generation at once riveting action packed funny heartbreaking and truly inspirational really did have everything going on right down to the catchy theme song and sappy tear jerker of an ending br br sweet what were we smoking i watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels and i cannot even describe it this is truly one of the worst movies ever made where to even begin leaving aside the plethora of laughable scientific errors on astronauts yeah sure thanks for that billy bob i'd have to say the worst thing about it was the remarkable dare i even say unmatched way in which it combined crappy writing with crappy acting there are too many examples of this to even begin listing here but one in particular springs to mind the scene where bruce willis is telling the feds exactly where to go to track down each of the oh so charmingly roguish members of his oil drilling team 'check every bar in new orleans' 'the craps tables in vegas' 'the only black guy on a motorcycle in all to the tune of 'come together' it reminded me a bit of the news team assemble scene from anchorman except serious ben affleck proves once again that he is by far the most overpaid actor in hollywood having less depth range and overall talent than anyone else in the business not that bruce willis liv tyler or anyone else in this godforsaken piece of garbage was much better br br i have to say though i got a kick out of seeing a pre stardom owen wilson get killed off half way through is this the only movie where his character dies br br peter stormare is perfect as the most stereotypical unshaven russian you have ever scene then again peter stormare does seem to have a talent for playing over the top it really was quite amusing how almost immediately after the americans dock with the russian space station which is actually called that in the movie ben affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular hollywood fashion i also love the fact that in the end paris is the only place on earth to get destroyed and that absolutely no one seems to care and on top of all that it at points literally turns into simultaneous ads for lockheed martin and kerr mcgee oh how proud i am to be an american br br there's plenty of other stuff to rant about but i won't suffice it to say that this is a really really really terrible movie that i feel ashamed to have ever genuinely liked br br i give it two stars just for the factor
<START> i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself am i going crazy can't i see the beauty from a film like this am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out i don't know maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well the film idea was going nowhere i was sure it would have a foggy end and of course it did nothing exceptional not even the landscapes i hopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice but no just a lame story about a crazy teacher and of course her crazy students now all grown up each of them with his her own fixed ideas and boy some of those ideas were stupid like the lizard story for example at a moment i thought i was watching x files with the lizard entering in the ear and all no from my point of view this movie is a waste of time not to say money if u pay for the ticket the only part that i did like was the acting of the young blue eye german kid he played very well and convincing for his age the rest nothing i read the previous review and i think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film i think to myself again maybe i am the crazy one advice don't waste your time with this
<START> it's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it's just a big shame and it's also big shame if people like h p lovecraft get abused by the likes of this i rented this movie cuz of the drop h p lovecraft on it and i'm a big fan of many of his adaptions mainly those done by brian yuzna stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old wine cellar digi cam effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid low grade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing stiff as wood and so must be the director it's obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesn't work and no gore effects just some blood in a river you drink you become demon and dropping here and there oh yeah the story thousands of years ago some big old colonised the world and took humans as slaves then mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in a post apocalyptic world the only possibility to save mankind is to find the necronomicon that's where it gets to lovecraft so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine cellar unbelievable the whole thing but as it is dubbed german title des and you can find it in most commercial video stores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive
<START> this is the best version of gypsy that has been filmed bette midler is simply superb as mama rose she has the voice the gestures the look and most of all a supreme acting ability to carry the role off and to make her character come alive her singing is simply put magnificent she especially shines in two numbers everything's coming up roses and rose's turn the other actors are also fine particularly christine as tessie also good is peter riegert his portrayal of herbie is acted with great style and believability the direction of this movie is very very good there isn't a false note or gaffe in the entire production this film is a vast improvement over the roz russell version filmed in 1962 since viewing it again i can state that the three greatest mama roses are ethel merman bette midler and angela lansbury see this movie you'll be glad that you did
<START> he did one at christmas to try and bring back a number one song and now the terrific justin lee collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite tv shows as a kid the a team the only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great george peppard who played main character col john hannibal smith but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help he did manage to reunite all members including dirk benedict lt templeton peck 2 who went to celebrity big brother in 2007 dwight schultz capt h m howling mad murdock melinda amy amanda allen william lucking col lynch and lance col roderick decker the only member of the team to die he did talk to mr t sgt b a in an anticipated interview but he was unavailable to turn up at the reunion it was really fun watching him trying to find them and talking to them even though they probably didn't want to and the reunion of course is the great climax very good
<START> a bright youngster interested in serious music admittedly a vanishing breed who'll play the fiddle when no one can play the violin could find this an interesting fiction about street kids and great musical stars was indeed the greatest violinist of his generation and the film gives him a rare on screen chance to display his technique the kids especially gene reynolds are fine and all in all the pic is a good example of first rate studio family fare of the late 30's it doesn't hit the top of the great '39 list but it's a nice way for an intelligent family to spend a rainy afternoon with amc or the video store good luck at blockbuster
<START> this film is a variation of a theme we've all seen over and over again the adventure in space the characters are all stock characters feisty heroine judas coward etc etc the only question really is who's next to snuff it sometimes this tried and tested formula works like in this case but more often not like the truly mind numbing red planet br br so why does this one work because it's stylish the acting is above average and above all it isn't predictable the conclusion isn't sign posted i really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end that alone deserves top marks in my book br br it's an intriguing and entertaining movie and though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it it doesn't disappoint
<START> l'homme is not for an impatient adventure seeking audience there are no explosions nor is the drama straightforward like the films of lynne ramsey the director is working more deeply with mood than with storytelling in a manner that is effective and incredibly moving because it does not rely on gratuitous nudity or superficial pop cult story lines this is quite frankly one of the best gay foreign film i have seen also see francois ozon pedro almodovar nicolas roeg's don't look now gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror film that film like l'homme is more than what the box might lead you to believe if you are in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the subtle transformed powers of cinema you'll love this movie
<START> this film is a very bad example of uninspired storytelling which tries to hide behind an facade trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence against women to cover up for it's lack of psychological depth of the characters internal conflicts everything in this movie is pretentious from the thank you's to bela tarr at the beginning to the photography the acting music the story editing when suddenly without reason you are forced to watch close ups of charismatic looking hungarian country people in their boats while the soundtrack is trying to persuade you that this is supposed to be a dramatic moment although they are only on the way to the funeral of the local alcoholic thats one thing putting completely unmotivated rape scenes as a shocker is a different thing for which i absolutely have no comprehension this movie is trying really hard to enter a certain genre of artistic east european drama kind of films but lacks the subtlety observational skills and soul that other directors have
<START> if you are looking for the feel good hit of the summer dark harvest 2 might just be your ticket the production values of this movie are extremely high looks as if it were filmed with a sony and edited using imovie especially the sound effects they sound straight off of a spooky halloween sounds cd the scarecrow from the cover although he doesn't appear in the movie and otherwise has no relevance is terrifyingly realistic from beginning to end you'll watch as a man aimlessly searches for his daughters through a pun intended maize at the climactic ending of the movie you'll see well you'll have to watch for yourself br br what i'm really trying to say here is don't come within 1000 yards of this movie i rented it because i thought it would be a campy sort of troll 2 funny but it's not i cried after i watched this movie because i realized i had spent money on it and i found the 4 i spent on renting it i actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on
<START> yes it takes a norwegian to ruin and slaughter two great books and a concept that would work well on film this film truly is the worst swedish film of all time i hated it so badly that i even considered walking out on it something i have never done but it was so awful i was almost compelling i just had to sit through to the end much like some early 80's stallone action reel this one really takes swedish action back to the stone age so full of logical errors and stupid mistakes it is almost amusing but who could ever see anything good in the terrible acting mark hamill's surviving a mine field or the dumb ass useless and irrational action br br let me ask you aren't we through with clocks ticking down to zero the hero escaping in the nick of time and two friends become enemies reuniting by the end stupid br br and one more thing the product placement in this film is unbelievable while other countries have understood that it shouldn't be so obvious the swedish film industry apparently hasn't understood at all just look at the credit card hamilton uses to open a window or or or this film really makes me mad
<START> the best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the pearl harbor attack in tora tora tora my favorite was the shot of the p 40 crashing into the row of parked p 40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane unfortunately it just gets worse from there br br there's two black guys and two white guys as american pows as well as some filipinos pows and japanese guards the ranking pow of the americans is a white naval lieutenant which is of course an o 3 in the navy at any rate he's in need of a haircut badly distractingly badly hockey hair does not belong in a wwii movie oh and he's a racist he doesn't want to share quarters with the of course in real life he wouldn't want to share quarters with the white enlisted guy either i think the geneva convention has a clause about officers quarters and enlisted but that wasn't the point here oh well i think plot is secondary to other issues in this flick he gets put in his place and pretty much spends the rest of the movie as a look out and running the air pump for the divers br br but once you get going it's not a bad story line the japs want the divers to raise the silver thrown out by the americans before fell the filipino resistance wants them to take their time and the pows do their best to help a potentially good story and not that badly done i guess a bit unbelievable when the pows use camp made re to swim between the pow camp and the filipino village every night maybe i'm not that picky when i know going in that this is not a blockbuster film i guess that's why it comes on a 20 pack dvd war movie collection for five bucks br br the 70s music did not belong in this movie or any wwii movie it's quite distracting to say the least the acting was not that bad probably better than i could do br br not being a fan of football at least i found out that jim brown is a real person and not somebody richard pryor made up that in itself was worth the i paid for this movie br br worth watching on tcm or paying a quarter for br br one star for being a war movie another for being wwii and one more because i'm feeling generous
