<START> this has to be one of the funniest movies i've ever seen the idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness when mom and dad both lose there jobs not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub they decide it's in their families best interest to move to oregon once there everything goes wrong an interesting cast of characters compliment this movie including a young molly ringwald this a movie i would definetly recommend
<START> purportedly this is the final film of the left behind series which is fundamentalist preacher and novelist tim idea of what we can expect in our future in the final days of planet earth if this is the case we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if barack obama becomes president next year br br the fantastic four of revelation are all back with one cast change arnold who most would know as the guidance counselor in life with derek is now the minister taking the place of clarence brad johnson as the anti christ's pilot by day and christian by night is there as his daughter stephens and ace investigative reporter kirk cameron these are the only four people on earth who have divined the true nature of un secretary general nicolai and once again are throwing sand in his machinery br br this time they've got as an ally the president of the united states who is played by louis gossett jr he's having one hell of a rough time especially the guerrillas launch on rpg attack on a presidential killing vice president charles martin smith that's right the toad is vice president somebody really messed up bad here because everyone including those who would do them harm know a president and vice president never travel together br br it takes all of them the entire film to convince gossett exactly who really is once again the best one in the film is gordon currie as br br we may yet see another left behind film yet the door was left open though people assure me that they've run out of source material from tim i suppose as long as they make money and these players can't get jobs in the mainstream film industry and there are some unresolved plot issues involving brad johnson and chelsea noble who is mrs kirk cameron in real life br br one of the fantastic four does die in this film so will it be the fantastic three or will they get another fourth stay tuned
<START> this is very much overrated i guess it carries some nostalgic value for many people it has its moments but every scene is heavily overacted and the plot is quite shallow with this cast it could have been much better
<START> i realize most people don't know who solomon kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience but then why bother to call it solomon kane in the first place when the name has no marketable value the characters certainly has nothing whatsoever to do with the r e howard character except he has a big hat that's where the resemblance ends br br it's always a bad sign when any superhero fantasy sci fi movie lingers over an origin story but when you invent one whole cloth like this for a character who didn't have one at all you've already missed the point completely kane is no longer even the fanatical christian warrior of the stories but rather a formerly bad guy who is trying to save his soul this part is in the opening scene br br with the most basic character elements changed or simply ignored the use of the name solomon kane is simply perplexing is it just so they can say from the creator of conan and hope to plug into a budding franchise if the new conan movie gets off the ground ignoring the complete departure from the stories the movie is competent if utterly generic for the first half but then devolves into sheer stupidity in the climactic scene which involves multiple super baddies think three boss levels at the same time none of whom is the least bit interesting or menacing br br if i wasn't a kane fan who was disappointed that they completely ignored the source material i'd probably give the film a 3 or 4 instead of a 1 even for the majority of viewers who will come into this knowing nothing about kane it's pretty thin gruel
<START> if you took all the stock elements of a shrek movie grumpy ogre annoying donkey cute kitty obligatory dance number etc put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 minutes you'd have this mess painful to watch i may have laughed once the story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines the final reworked rendition of the christmas story poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes and boy a little eddie murphy goes a long way with its desperate attempt to be hip and current this show will be long outdated and forgotten while classics like the will remain timeless a sad waste of effort by all involved a veritable jumping of the shark for the shrek franchise
<START> perhaps it's just the format of this film a documentary but i believe that the movie would have been much better served by good actors and more solid dialogue the fact that the actors are also the business owners is a double edged sword they know better than anyone else the emotions and complexities of the business they were in but since they are not professional actors they do a very poor job of conveying those emotions and the documentary suffers there were some truly memorable scenes in this movie and lots of good lines but they were delivered so poorly that they will fade away with time and the only memory i will have of this documentary is that it had some good scenes which i can't remember br br watch this if you want a first hand account of the com bust and see what happened to the 99 of people in the industry who didn't become instant however be prepared for some nauseating camera work poor acting poor dialogue and an overall bad movie that epitomizes the era of the internet boom
<START> after reading some of the earlier nasty remarks i had to put in my two cents this show was not despite what that goon in essex thinks the worst thing that ever aired on tv i think most of today's tv is much worse when is this stupid reality fad ever going to end and there isn't a current show i can stand to watch gimme the stuff i grew up with i'm a 1965 baby and not ashamed to admit it br br this show has been my all time favorite for almost 30 years i was in high school when it originally aired and i think it helped me to hang on throughout those miserable days i was such a misfit back then and fantasy island appealed to my imagination as i was a budding writer in those days it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the craft what a wonderful premise i won't say it didn't have its faults sometimes the scripts were pretty bad and some of the problems seemed trivial but it could be good too and it was a blast to watch and still is as for the cheesiness factor well i think it's unfair to label every single 70s product as cheesy there was a lot of great stuff back then and this was among the ranks btw most of the seasons aired in the 80s my favorite episodes came from seasons 2 3 and 4 mostly br br to those who disparage hervÃ© villechaize for his heavy french accent and his short stature grow up and learn something it's so easy to make fun when you're normal and perfect that man made the best of what he was dealt in life and if you don't like it that's just tough have a little compassion he's been dead 15 years and how easy it is to cut down someone who can't defend himself there's just no shame anymore br br i love this show so it looks dated hate to tell you this but we didn't have splashy special effects and blu ray discs we were lucky to have vcrs live with it accept it for what it is and that's just plain fun escapist tv describes it perfectly and that's what it was for me an escape from my rotten real life and it's still a lot of fun to watch
<START> this has got to be the best movie i've seen you definately have to watch it more than once to find all of the humor and twists i'm no fan of george clooney but he shines here the real performance comes from tim blake nelson and john turturro as pete and delmar one of the few movies that i own
<START> a three stooges short this one featuring shemp of all those involving shemp i've seen this is my favorite performance by him in a stooges short the basic plot is that shemp must get married by 6 o'clock that very evening if he's to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will so shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected that is until they learn of his inheritance money best bits here involve shemp shaving shemp and moe in a telephone booth and larry on piano as accompaniment to shemp's voice training session also the sequence where shemp is mistaken as cousin basil and its outcome proves hilarious
<START> keep away from this one the worst thing is the appalling story there seems to be an intent to convey some subtle spiritual love friendship message but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance you can't help but cringe in addition the majority of screen time is a far below standard story of thieves criminals and our hero es dealing with some alien time travel artifacts i know you are asking for trouble when dealing with time but the story is more full of holes than usual also you have cheap sets bad acting and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of the moving picture overpowering cheap abrupt and disjointed all i can say is man alive this film is bad
<START> obviously influenced by the success of pal's destination moon and x m this one just doesn't make the cut limited special effects a thin story line result in a production that even the half decent cast can't save just no believability here no one seems surprised to encounter martians much like earthlings etc etc pass on it
<START> bloody birthday is a totally rubbish slasher movie from beginning to end br br i found the acting to be pretty good considering the genre of movie and its obvious low budget i don't know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly way too over saturated maybe this is a bad transfer to dvd or maybe it always looked like that i don't know br br there really are no redeeming qualities to speak of there are a few deaths but not really gory i wouldn't bother with it if i was you the best thing about the dvd was the 15 minute interview with producer max rosenberg who was very amusing and honest he didn't have anything good to say about director ed hunt and admits the movie was a failure but he would like to re make it as he believes it has a decent plot however he died in 2004 so i guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge with the way things have been going in the last few years it wouldn't surprise me there's at least one re make per week at the cinema these day it couldn't be any worse than the original i suppose but i couldn't care less whether it got re made or not
<START> i am assuming that the rave reviews on this page were from people who have never read the book unfortunately for those of us who love the text hollywood outdid itself on destroying this one br br i am not sure where on earth the woman love interest came from except that she replaced the cat nor why our rogue male acquired a helpful family back in blighty in fact the vast majority of the book has been cut out and replaced with your standard cruddy love story the ambiguity about which world leader was in his sights was removed completely and our rogue was given a name neither of these appeared until the second book br br i gave it a 2 rather than a 1 simply because of the wonderfully bad cockney accents joan bennett outdoes dick van dyke in mary poppins by miles and this goes a tiny way towards saving it br br ah well brits should probably avoid this trust me
<START> the 3rd and last big screen spin off from the very popular itv sitcom of the early 1970's holiday on the buses is every bit as resistible and crude as the previous two efforts and observing from a standpoint three and a half decades later it is truly mind boggling that even one film was produced in this franchise br br what constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of stan butler reg varney his conductor jack bob grant and their autocratic inspector blake stephen lewis after their from their regular jobs at the bus depot they all find work in similar positions at a holiday camp with stan's family doris hare anna karen michael robbins following br br british cinema had a deserved and considerable reputation for high quality in the 1960's but much of this was due to american financial support and guidance which sadly drew to a close as the 1970's dawned thereafter notable homegrown titles get carter being the among these very few exceptions became as rare as mick jagger in a stable marriage and uk cinema went down the road of cheap budgets sleazy and witless sex comedies the confessions series come play with me and flabby elongated celluloid versions of various tv shows mostly sitcoms this being one of many hideous examples only dad's army and porridge came off fairly respectably in this regard the quirky success of the first on the buses film it was the biggest box office hit of it's year in 1971 nonsensical to think now led to two further sequels br br to be fair the tv series itself had a cheerful ripe non pc vulgarity about it which was reasonably tolerable in half hour sitcom form but stretched to three times that length it taxes the patience beyond belief it's ironical that hammer films produced this effort as it virtually resembles a horror film in the literal sense with ancient puns hackneyed poorly timed slapstick and awful seedy production values br br a chance to send up the cheesiness of the british holiday camp is totally wasted here in favour of the above elements and it is most bizarre if not gruesome to see the obviously 50 something varney and the nosed long toothed grant managing to instantly charm young women barely in their early twenties while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes the presence of wilfrid brambell from steptoe and son romancing the aged miss hare does not help matters either and even though the film lasts about 1 and a half hours it drags on to an interminably depressing degree br br thankfully this was the last film in this most dire of film trilogies and the tv series itself came to an end around the same time with a sequel don't drink the water which was roundly savaged by the critics and ignored by audiences following in 1975 most of the leading actors involved were not seen much afterwards but the worst affected was bob grant afflicted with depression and other mental problems for many years he committed suicide in 2003 a sad coda to a sitcom that was the most popular of it's era it has not aged too well either and should have remained that way rather than the three financially successful but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids which diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of it's tv counterpart br br rating 2 and a half out of 10
<START> i have just returned from santa fe i visited chapel as i looked around this building which has been acquired by a private owner i relived the movie version of the staircase it is an overwhelming mystique that occupies this building it is about what can happen if you really have faith the bookstore there has a narrative on the subject which is the story of the staircase i read the narrative in its entirety i was absorbed by the ambiance surrounding the people therein it was like we were totally enclosed in a time warp all with the same thoughts and awe when we departed the hush was overwhelming everyone should visit chapel in santa fe
