<START> the sound in this movie is a nightmare that is the best i can say for this movie any chance of a good story is lost once this films starts the premise of the film sounds good a playboy who comes to terms with the people around him the plot is predictable and very dull the wet t shirt contest may be the worst scene i've ever watched and is almost worth watching in a mystery science type of deal the sound is at times hard to hear and the main actor seems to not know how to speak clearly his accent makes him very hard to understand the only bright sport is the acting of penelope ann miller her role is underdeveloped but she plays it well in short do not waste your time
<START> this is one of the rare movies that i did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it this wasn't because it had particularly entranced or impressed me the contrary it had given me nothing at all br br why because somehow everything was so much overdone that i couldn't take this film seriously anymore there was so much sex and violence that i got the strong impression that the film was trying very very hard to be offensive as if it was aiming at superlatives in ugliness rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crime br br baise moi had been described as thelma louise with actual sex to me well it is true that the main idea is similar there are two women traveling through the country because they've committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now that the police are going to catch them and they decide that now that everything's over anyway there is no way to hold back br br baise moi had been described as a feminist film where women who had suffered from male dominance in the past exact revenge upon the men that they encounter br br this is something that i had never interpreted into this film simply because none of these women had ever been innocent and because they do not just kill irresponsible violent men but also men that they seduce themselves men that show the sense of wanting to do protected sex and they kill women no they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous brutal ways br br how easily the heroines decide to murder and how much pleasure they take in it made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way or even take them seriously it was just all too much too much sex too much violence i got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a superlative in ugliness rather than in conveying a story or making a point br br baise moi left me with no impression hadn't set me thinking because it was so far removed from any real world so constructed unrealistic and over the top br br there was nothing that i could do with this film there was simply nothing about it to think about other than why did they make this terrible film had the intense unpleasantness going on in this film served a purpose i'd easily accepted it but since i found nothing since the film's story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film i filed it away under unnecessary torture decided to never ever ever watch this film again and i now consider this to be the worst film i've ever seen br br worst not just because it really isn't my cup of tea to watch people get raped rape have sex in other forms and kill one another but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film if they wanted to say anything at all it just didn't work and there's nothing else that could save this film because it's also filmed in such an ugly style
<START> this movie gave me recurring nightmares with alan voice representing an omnipotent insidious fascist ruler the scariest movie i have ever seen psychological terror more powerful than anything any horror movie has ever achieved alan voice will always represent to me the power and terror of a totalitarian state reminiscent of orwell's 1984 this movie describes to those who don't care the reality of a large part of current world governments this film is disturbing but in a way that everyone should watch it it's a description of a reality that no one should ever have to experience but so many do
<START> first of all i must say i really enjoy watching this movie the way we follow the different people at the same time works perfectly and its one of those movies that really makes you think br br spoiler br br the fact that the the girls who kills herself is the one you don't notice that fact made me wonder since thats why she commits suicide in the movie the director impressed me with that making a movie that shows the plot to the audience and also deliver the message that not a lot of people would have seen it coming some people might start talking about why no one did anything to stop it before she did it but no one noticed her just like no one who watched the movie did either don't know about you but i did not guess that it would be her who committed suicide did you br br regards jan
<START> im warning you people out there this is just a waste of your time i am being honest when i'm saying that this is the worst movie i've ever seen its just a move about christian propaganda don't throw away your life don't see it br br i think they made the movie so more people will believe in jesus or something but it works in the opposite way the actors are all newbies the story is just fuzzy br br i think this movie is a work of the devil br br this movie is just not worth seeing so please take my advice and don't
<START> we just saw this film previewed before release at the norfolk va film forum and there was general agreement on two matters there were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others and secondly the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster we saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between samuel jackson and cristina ricci whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas what's sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too heavy for them while the people who would really enjoy it wouldn't be caught dead walking into the theater showing it too bad a good film wasted
<START> the red circle jean pierre melville france italy 1970 br br this might be the coolest film ever made in the most literal sense of the term the men here never lose control and never not once show their emotions no dramatic outbursts in this film everyone is cool all the time it's an abstract dream world where the men live by their own code a gangster code with the values of the outside world conspicuously absent in this masterfully filmed heist saga melville tackles the american crime thriller in his distinctly dark and desolate style yet made in grand fashion with a hefty budget of ten million dollars and with four of the greatest french stars at the time alain delon as the master thief yves montand as an alcoholic ex cop italian star gian maria as an escaped criminal and andrÃ© in an atypical role as the cynical police chief br br melville described le rouge as his penultimate film and it is indeed a masterfully stylized policier he also claimed he wanted to shoot a film noir in colour and in many ways he succeeded the two primary influences for this film were john huston's 1950 heist movie the asphalt jungle and jules dassin's rififi 1955 but unlike these films where we learn much about the background of the individual gang members with all their petty needs and worries that motivate them making clear these are not just ruthless underworld types but ordinary individuals engaged in a world of everyday worries and human endeavour melville though tells us almost nothing about his criminals why was corey alain delon in jail why was his associate vogel jean marie arrested in the first place or why the ex police marksman jansen yves montand left the force was it his alcoholism we never learn the motivations behind their actions and never find out what drives these men women are even more absent than in his earlier films with the emotional ties exclusively between men they don't even seem to have personal lives a sort of an emotional twilight zone and although the setting is not as abstract as in his earlier le samourai 1967 melville still sketches a very eerie world melville's favorite actor alain delon is perfect and almost outdoes himself in coolness if imaginable br br deliberately paced and with a length of over 140 minutes melville takes his time to tell the story but its slow pace and length seems a perfect way to show the desolate world these men live in nothing is ever out of place in melville's films and here it's no different every little detail seemingly of pivotal importance for the story although le samourai remains my favorite melville film even up there with the greatest films ever made this one also belongs to the very best br br camera obscura 10 10
<START> forever strong is one of those sports movies you can actually watch it reminded me a lot of remember the titans because it included comedy sadness and just awesomeness i saw it at a pre screening and all my friends liked it and easily put it in their top 2 sport movies the acting is great in the movie even though it is similar to remember the titans it there is something very unique about this movie i feel this is definitely oscar worthy and will receive many awards everybody should definitely go see this movie and it is worth your 10 i'm going to have to see it again when it comes out because it was that good i cant say one bad thing about the movie
<START> i will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the hideous plot lines i'll just say that this movie suffers from poor animation over acting obvious tag linesÂ these are some of it's good qualities if you are deserted on an isolated island and the only link to civilization you got is this movie throw it to the fish i can't tell you how much i'm sorry i saw this horrifying ghastly movie speaking of which this movie supposedly a horror movie cannot be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is the playing capabilities of some of the actors br br take care
<START> this film is terrible not only is the story unbelievable the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly to the point where it isn't shocking i find it sad that daisy star of broadway's the secret garden decided that this would be a career step the idea is interesting two young girls coming of age very quickly but the sex isn't even arousing the film is silly the story is silly the performances are silly and the whole concept while interesting falls flat i'm sure all 14 year old girls make out with guys after they've had their first period and tried to flush their panties down the toilet better luck next time guys my scale t scale
<START> the timing of this film being released could not be better particularly in light of all the turmoil in this world today the film is a heartwarming endearing and witty a piece if you have siblings and still have parents alive this will hit home well for the viewer if you've lost your parents then it will touch you deeply the laughs come frequently the ensemble cast works very well together and are believable this film is intelligently written and the lines that come from each of the actors make the viewer laugh out loud frequently there are moments that will bring tears to your eyes as well i would recommend this film to anyone who respects the of family and can follow an intelligent film
<START> it may be although there are still two or three i've missed this film constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from sherlock holmes movies and it with sinister kafka esque characters into their midst the movie drops mia farrow who sounds like she's still playing hannah and woody allen who seems to be reprising his nebbish role from play it again sam are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and hand wringing i suppose i would if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy but it's not at least i don't think it is
<START> stranded in space 1972 mst3k version a very not good tv movie pilot for a never to be made series in which an astronaut finds himself trapped on earth's evil twin having a planet of identical size and mass orbiting in the same plane as the earth but on the opposite side of the sun is a well worn sf chestnut the idea is over 2 000 years old having been invented by the ancient greeks in this version the counter world is run as an orwellian 'perfect' society where for totally inexplicable reasons everyone speaks english and drives late model american cars after escaping from his hospital the disruptive is chased around not southern california by tv and bad movie stalwart cameron mitchell who like his minions wears double breasted suits and black polo neck jumpers a stylishly evil combination which i fully intend to adopt if ever i become a totalitarian overlord our hero escapes several times before ending up gazing at the alien world's three moons and wondering aloud if he will ever get home thus setting up one of those man alone in a hostile world making a new friend each week but moving on at the end of every episode shows so beloved of the industry in the 70s and 80s 'the 'the incredible 'the littlest etc the curiously weirdest bit though was the title sequence somewhere between in space' first airing under the title 'the stranger' in 1972 and the mst3k version in 1991 it somehow acquired some footage from the 1983 movie of the lost so in 1991 the opening credits for in space' run under a few shots of three people falling into a matter transmitter and vanishing it's a sequence that has nothing to do even thematically with anything that is going to follow br br just to add to the nerdy b movie confusion one of the actors in this nailed on footage kay lenz later appeared in a 1994 movie called in space' knowing this fact could never save your life but it might score you very big points and admiring looks from fellow trash movie enthusiasts if you could ever work out a way of the conversation round to the point where you could casually slip it in without looking like a total idiot
<START> human traffic is purely a been there done that' experience Â only this time it's quite limp br br major themes explored are paranoia male impotence and jealousy Â but only mildly and poorly br br a lot of the movie seems to want to imitate trainspotting drug culture Â but it fails to include the low times come downs that trainspotting deals with eg issues with death dependence etc it even tries to come up with a similar monologue to ewan classic choose life' speech Â but the milky bars are on me yeah ' Â what the fudge is that all about br br the characters try to analyse their lifestyle but when their lifestyle is so shallow Â their analysis becomes boring and repetitious br br the soundtrack for a movie that is trying to be cool is pathetic it includes the likes of fat boy slim and cj Â come on people Â good dance music is be better than this br br the characters become grating and annoying especially half way through the movie and the lack of care for the characters soon dawns br br there are a couple of funny scenes Â but they are few and far between the mother catching the son in the bedroom was quite amusing br br but please Â i'm sick to death of the star wars analogy scenes i thought it was much more sharper in a couple of kevin smith's movies ie clerks and chasing amy according to the characters Â yoda is a drug fiend hence that's why he is short and bald Â huh br br my score Â 4 out of 10 Â do yourself a favour and see trainspotting or go instead
<START> i used to enjoy happy ever after but was absolutely hypnotised by terry june with aunt lucy gone the emphasis seemed to fall more heavily on the relationship between terry and june a middle aged middle class english couple and i thoroughly enjoyed it losing myself quite happily in each episode br br the 1980s were the era of alternative comedy but they were also the decade of choice and terry and june certainly suited more traditional tastes and mine and i was a huge fan of the young ones too each week terry got into a silly situation and june got pulled in herself and usually ended up having to bail him out how dated the shows seem now it was a different world but it's great fun to see trends of the 1980s featured such as the cb radio storyline of 1982 cb radio was legalised in england in november 1981 which saw terry imprisoned in his car in the back of a lorry i've been watching the shows again recently on dvd and i still think they're terrific not loved by the enlightened elite the chattering classes but a huge hit with the masses wonderful
