<START> low rent version of ashley judd's double jeopardy sutherland is too professional to be bad but what was fonda thinking the penelope ann miller curse continues think about it when has she ever been in a good movie other than other people's money and i'm not saying she's bad but all of her movies fail in some way
<START> i mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what i discuss although i don't really think i am giving away anything important any suprises are really unimportant to this film's success or a viewer's ability to enjoy it br br while not without some very minor flaws this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship time uncertainty and the choices people make about their lives yet at the same time it is also a very humorous film with small mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout for much of the film it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and into the lives of the characters and at first it is mostly rather light hearted some have commented that much of the film seems slow but it is such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that one could watch it almost endlessly as it progresses the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully br br eventually some of the characters decide to rob a bank and although it is perhaps somewhat hard to believe that is beside the point it is a wonderful addition to emphasise the love that these friends have for each other while at the same time it accents the humour and adds a little more irony to the film and although hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully making it really quite funny as well such as when if i remember correctly exaggerates his aggressiveness to disguise the fact he's old br br as i said most of the other comedy is rather low key but still very humorous so i was constantly chuckling throughout br br the actors are probably the real key to this film they imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth there are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters' personalities which are pulled off smoothly and beautifully of course the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care for and interact with one another it succeeds so well because of them and if lesser actors had the roles the movie could well have failed br br is not without sadness but that simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience in fact the film is so moving and filled with so much love from such rich characters that it is in the end a very heart warming satisfying and even happy film despite its sadness i could watch it over and over
<START> a tough sell british playwright ronald harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud bellowing film about wwii shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged blustery brilliant but unreliable star at the end of his tether the actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of king lear during an air raid yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation based on the waning years of actor donald whose dresser was ronald harwood this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery chewing thespians unfortunately albert finney at this point in his career not at all elderly seems too robust and quick thinking to play the actor finney and oscar nominated director peter yates cannot modulate moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice and in the next he's curiously falling apart with such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss and his future yet servant tom prods and badgers and finney to carry on rather than rest who played this part on stage and was nominated for an oscar alongside finney for best actor is far more attuned to his role and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film these two thankfully do not peck at each other's heads and scenarist harwood is careful not to fall into a love hate pattern which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act but without a juxtaposition of servant vs celebrity there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism the hint at what once was 1 2 from
<START> i saw this movie partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at netflix and from it i leaned a valuable lesson not a lesson about ethnic diversity however the lesson i learned is don't trust reviews br br yes racism sucks and people are complicated but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they do see it the only reason that i can think of for the number of good reviews is that it's being reviewed by people who aren't used to thinking or who've seen their first thought provoking movie and somehow think that haggis invented the concept in fact he basically made this film which should be called racism for dummies as emotionally wrenching as possible seemingly to give people who don't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they've discovered some fundamental truth that's never been covered in a film before zen and the art of motorcycle it's not an after school special for the unthinking masses cut into bite sized overwrought ham fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection br br it's as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme simply to make us happy that we're such good people because we don't identify with the characters let's face it people nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reverse stereotypes it's well acted even if the dialog is atrocious and cleverly executed so much that you don't think to ask where's the beef until you can tell the film is winding down the flaming car scene was well executed like much of the movie but went nowhere in the end br br the messages are very heavy handed and from the behind the scenes blurb the producers were clearly watching a different movie because there is very little to laugh about in this movie even during the intended funny parts i have to stress that this is not entertainment more like a high school diversity lesson call it the blood on the highway of racism they could even show this in high schools if it weren't for the side nude shot of jennifer esposito br br in this film everyone's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson except for michael pena who gets the best role but the most predictable storyline br br this is a bad film with bad writing and good actors an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling a picture painted with crayons br br crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things
<START> i have always loved the muppets though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable the muppet's was the muppet's are very very funny they are probably the most likable children's characters ever br br not only did the muppets have their own show they also have starred in many films from the muppet's christmas carol to the muppet's treasure island the first muppet's movie the muppet movie was also like the show and the other films excellent br br the muppet movie is about how they all got started kermit the frog used to live in a swamp until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in hollywood so kermit takes off for hollywood along the way he runs into lots of people such as fozzie bear gonzo the great and miss piggy also an evil man is trying to capture kermit br br all of the muppet films are highly enjoyable i mean they are all very funny this film has many film appearances such as steve martin mel brooks elliot gould carol kane richard pryor and orson welles the muppet films are all very enjoyable i hear that jason segel is going to star in one soon i can't wait to see it
<START> everything about this movie was bad the acting was bad and the plot was bad and were is all the blood and gore that was in demons which is a good movie and it was not scary at all my brother said that this movie was bad but i had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good when the movie was over i understand why my brother thought this movie was bad the only plus in this movie was the music by the smiths and the cult but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing and i saw that it has been released four sequels after this film i haven't seen none of them but can they be as awful as this one i have no plans to see them but maybe i will see them some time
<START> i thought i'd witnessed every wrinkle the crime gangster flick had to offer but the garrett hammett combination pull off some genuine thrills and surprises here thanks to the inventively forceful direction by mamoulian the atmospheric photography by lee garmes plus remarkably sharp film editing and flawless special effects brilliant acting helps too coop gives one of his most convincing performances as the reticent hayseed turned fearless the sort of character progression he was to repeat in other roles such as sergeant york miss sidney pictured center in her first major role is also an eye opener the principals receive great support from paul lukas gibson and stanley fields as the heavies and even from robert hard as nails detective the movie has obviously been realized on an extensive budget which is brilliantly deployed in its realistic crowd filled sets
<START> my friend recommended this movie to me is should have known not to watch it because my friend is kind of a video game nerd but the name and the cover made it look good for some reason i was so wrong i mean first of all what is up with their suits and the acting it seems like they got the people off barney except for ben kingsley and why was he even in this movie did he think it was a comedy but i have to say the special effects were pretty good but that was like the only good thing in it i mean seriously the movie is worse than pearl harbor and thats actually an understatement everyone must have thought oh i am getting paid so it doesn't matter if its the worst movie in the world i would understand why someone would make this kind of movie if they were directing acting producing writing and getting their hopeless life best friend to do filming and editing probably one of the worst sci fi movies ever one truly jacked up film
<START> the very few reviews i could find online of really do not do it justice i read them all before ordering the dvd but for some reason i ordered it anyway i regretted it almost immediately but the order had already gone through so i couldn't cancel it i'm very glad now that i couldn't it's an extraordinary movie br br i won't give a synopsis of the plot because other reviewers have already done that but i will say that i don't understand comments that it's bleak shocking weird clinical depressing or pornographic it is certainly very unusual which i suppose could make it seem weird to some people but the other criticisms must reflect the reviewers' own issues because i didn't see any of that in the movie i just watched i'm not attracted to boys so the nudity didn't seem pornographic at all to me it's just a kid trying to figure out who he is with no help at all from the irresponsible adults in his life and it's sweden not utah so topless women are no big deal br br but what surprised me most is how positive the movie is in its depiction of this gutsy lost kid who goes on a sort of odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences looking for and ultimately finding himself it's fascinating thoroughly original and deeply satisfying br br i'm not at all surprised that won three major awards for best film direction and actor but i'm absolutely astounded that the actor who won was not tomas the kid whose fearless performance as reine must be one of the most remarkable ever filmed but in the relatively insignificant role of stig mother's sleazy boyfriend i don't understand that at all but it doesn't alter the fact that this is a great movie
<START> i do not understand why anyone would waste their time or money on utter trash like this don't get me wrong i love a good western notice i said good this is just trash br br the acting is horrible val kilmer must know someone or owed a favor or something for them just to use his face and name in this ridiculous piece of crap br br to those of you who enjoyed this movie i am making a list of you're names to ensure i do not watch anything you suggest our tastes are definitely different yet it is your right to voice your opinion no matter how far off base it is br br i gave this movie a 2 just in case they do throw out all of the one's and not count them just bad in all
<START> babette's feast for me is about healing the schism between spirit and body in orthodox christianity this puritanical community in remote denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of god's gifts in creation they have taken the dualism of st paul to an extreme and stress the life of the spirit not the life of the flesh both elderly sisters in their youth were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village they and their parishioners cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and the sisters' father the aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome and the sisters don't know what to do enter babette a french stranger and someone to whom they can show kindness they have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry dusty theology babette will give everything she has and in the process will teach the sisters and their flock about grace about sacrifice about how sensual experience as in the bread and wine of the can change lives and about why true art moves us so deeply when they can forgive each other and themselves they can focus on god's love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present as a minister and an artist i can't recommend a movie more highly true art and true grace
<START> wow here comes another straight to video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy if the cheap looking opening credits don't tell you you're in for quite a ride then the diabolically tragic writing sure will br br a diabetic kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation onto the baseball team then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people need i say more this movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with imovie note that spooky color inversion and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some late night cinemax special actually thats not fair as the actors didn't have much room to work around the abysmal script parts of this movie really seem like parody especially when one character picks up his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever conceived by humans with the worst lip synching ever performed to go along with it the gore here is also a major disappointment in most b movies such as this there is a thick layer of cheap gore fx to make up for what the story and acting lacks here the stuff is so cheap that it's not even fun this movie actually makes jack frost 2 look like lots of fun in comparison br br if you think this movie is the worst one you've ever seen then you probably haven't gotten deep into the world of straight to video b horror regardless this movie will cause you a great deal of mental anguish no matter what your background
<START> a horrendous film ill conceived and crude the acting of anne heche and vince vaughan is so inferior to that of perkins and leigh in the original version they have to be seen to be believed there was no reason to make this picture which only highlights how accomplished and brilliant hitchcock was and how inimitable also there's a creeping pervasive insensitivity in the film that isn't there in the first film hitchcock's psycho was scary and shocking but one could genuinely feel for all concerned even the pitiful norman bates there were moments of pathos irony and fey humor the remake doesn't have one of the best things about hitchcock's film was its incredible and intuitive depth and sense of nuance of when to cut away and when to show something on whether to use a close up or long shot on whether to make an actor sympathetic and when to make him frightening and so forth the remake has none of these qualities and doesn't even try for them it's an idiotic exercise that i'm amazed even got released
<START> over 21 the film version of the ruth gordon play which detailed her experiences trying to keep the marriage together with garson kanin after he'd gone in the service provides irene dunne with one of her better later roles on the big screen it's also in keeping with what was then an upbeat spirit in america about how we would not screw up the peace as we did in the first world war and sow the seeds of yet another global conflict br br the play ruth gordon wrote and starred in herself ran for 221 performances in 1944 on broadway and was confined simply to the bungalow that gordon and harvey stephens who was the male lead had on a training base if you look on the broadway credits list it says that the production was by george s kaufman as opposed to being directed by him i'm not sure of the distinction but i can imagine that with a wit and will as strong as kaufman's it must have been an interesting period putting the production together before opening night br br when columbia bought the screen rights sidney buchman had to do some considerable script reconstruction to move the action beyond the bungalow the film bears very little trace of its stage origins br br alexander knox plays the husband and charles coburn the employer of both dunne and knox who are writers knox has graduated to not only editor but featured columnist his words and thoughts help sell the paper and coburn is in a bind but knox feels he has to get into the war the seminal event of his time in order to speak authoritatively on the kind of post war world he wants this was not an uncommon theme in those years br br irene dunne has some good comic moments the kind she used to have when she was appearing opposite cary grant in fact garson kanin directed both of them in my favorite wife a few years earlier coburn is his usual cantankerous old water buffalo of a boss who ultimately has a good heart br br over 21 was an optimistic picture which sad to say wasn't accurate about what the allies and i mean all of them could bring to the peace conferences to create a better world still hopefully a new generation will get it right
<START> stay alive has a very similar story to some asian horror films which include technology on the story some of this asian horror films are one missed call ringu and pulse so the idea of stay alive is very clichÃ©d and obvious but the filmmakers behind it did not know how to put something new or interesting to the clichÃ©s in stay alive this film is totally crap but a very big crap all the elements of stay alive belong to the worst class of films shallow characters nothing of suspense stupid which makes laugh and light violence it's easy to note that the is incapable to create something original or disturbing i do not wanna loose more time writing about this pathetic film i just give you an advice do not see this film i really hated it
