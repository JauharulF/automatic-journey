<START> besides the fact that this guy is a liar he is also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community once when i attempted to watch this excuse for a television show i believe i actually threw up in my mouth a little i can't help but feel a little bit dumber every time is see one of his horrid commercials while i am enjoying great comedy central programs like reno 911 and american body shop it shows like this that make me worry about the continual existence of mankind it's hard to believe that even joe can make someone look like an moron please begin praying now that comedy central will realize their mistake and end this show as soon as possible haven't we suffered enough
<START> that's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film i just saw this baby at the munich film festival and it rocked the house director doug pray is never seen in this documentary nor i think he is even heard but he has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the mixer he has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about i was never big into scratching but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little and infusing in jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area mix master mike from the beastie boys is in this film but it wasn't until after the film that i could name several heavy hitters in the industry dj shadow q bert etc the extreme fascination for by these talented and quirky djs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them the film also sheds some gratifying light on these guys and one woman to be classified as musicians pray doesn't let his film idle and if there exists a slow scene it is soon re energized by hardly ever music if nothing else this film will increase your slang vocabulary i have to get back to digging so i'll end this review see it it will be of interest good stuff man good stuff
<START> in a genre by itself this film has a limited audience and narrow appeal coupled with a subtle undertone which permeates the entire production nevertheless it is a remarkable piece of cinema which is as timeless as a rare work of art capturing a time in rarely seen in movies mon oncle strength lies in the depth of its characters and the richness of the settings parochial and feudal is brilliantly cast as the backdrop which could not possibly be achieved by anyone other than a pure laine br br it would be far too easy to resort to stereotypes clichÃ©s and single minded myopic statements in this story yet the director chose to skip the forced imagery and instead focused on the essence of life in rural of the time that makes this film exceptional in its authenticity while not being pretentious in its presentation if only more contemporary cinematic endeavors would do the same the viewing public might not be forced to choose between the over hyped hollywood that passes for 'must see' viewing br br mon oncle antoine is in every sense of the word unforgettable it will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived in or visited a classic br br follow up 10 may 2008 br br after reviewing some of the comments it's worth noting mon oncle antoine is not and probably wasn't meant to serve as standard hollywood american cinema for mass market sales a coming of age story yes but far more than simple memoirs of adolescence in 1940's viewers who're looking for sheer entertainment at the expense of complex development of the characters will be sorely disappointed go watch action adventure romance comedies to be amused watch mon oncle antoine to be drawn into a seldom seen but absolutely remarkable society that has been overlooked and ignored for far too long br br the grapes of wrath is hardly an edge of the seat thriller yet the story and characters are what makes this american classic an enduring film mon oncle antoine is in the same genre
<START> multiply named and strangely casted one dark night aka mausoleum is one of the better early horror video rentals original and quite raw we meet adam west briefly in this film about telekinesis and teen age meg tilly is dared into spending the night in a crypt by the sisters a high school gang of hair hoppers in blue satin jackets the initiation is interrupted by the recently interred body of a mass murdering psychic wizard called surprisingly awesome make up and scare effects paints this chiller film with style and deliver a heart pounding climax
<START> in a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list moreover it does it objectively and realistically and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick and to add some irony to it all even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty it is not at the heart of dead man walking ' directed by tim robbins is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all and with good reason because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really and truly understand and it is what this film is actually all about forgiveness real forgiveness not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof not saying that what's happened is okay but finding the strength to go on and to do so by choosing life br br director screenwriter tim robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by sister helen in which she discusses her involvement with the death row inmates to whom over the years she has her faith in god as chronicled in the film what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice but human dignity began with a simple letter from a death row inmate at the louisiana state prison at angola sentenced to death for rape and murder matthew sean penn was reaching out to anyone who would listen when his letter ended up in the hands of sister susan sarandon who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience and robbins has successfully captured sister emotional and turbulent journey succinctly while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality which makes it not only real credible and believable but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience through the medium of the cinema what was once a personal significant emotional experience for sister becomes one for everyone who sees this film as well br br for her soul stirring impassioned portrayal of sister susan sarandon deservedly won the oscar for best actress sensitive and fraught with emotional depth her performance is incredibly touching and real especially in the way in which she conveys sister underlying natural fragility and vulnerability which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of and in reality a total of five since she began whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film sister is without question an individual of heroic proportions which sarandon exquisitely personifies here and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics but rather by keeping it real by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization it's an extraordinary performance arguably the best of sarandon's brilliant career br br turning in a career best performance as well is sean penn who was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of he lost out to nicolas cage who won for his performance in leaving las vegas perfect for the part in every way penn has quite simply never been better before or since he effectively presents as a real person rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here not that it makes any less despicable just the opposite in fact it makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things and that's the strength of penn's performance it's so disturbingly real presented with depth and nuance you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul a terrific performance and as good as cage was in vegas' penn should have received the oscar for it br br in another stand out performance raymond j barry is memorable in a supporting role as earl father of one of victims with limited screen time he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him as well as with sister as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is at least on the surface barry presents in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film br br the supporting cast includes r lee emery clyde percy celia weston mary beth percy lois smith helen's mother scott wilson chaplin farley roberta maxwell lucille margo martindale sister colleen and jack black craig it is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty but that was never the intention what was intended was to make a thought provoking emotionally involving film which is exactly what robbins has accomplished with dead man walking ' regardless of your personal point of view this film will have an impact and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness for as we see through the character of earl true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do but is a task that can become a lifetime's work and it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like sister who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need and to filmmakers like robbins and sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her i rate this one 10 10 br br
<START> mishima is one of the greatest films ever made now i think paul schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time but i don't really like the films he's directed of what i've seen with the exception of this and affliction but this is an amazing disturbing and highly 3 dimensional character study it follows the life of yukio mishima japan's most celebrated writer combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories i don't know how but paul schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way the acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by philip glass although confusing the first viewing this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing truly an underrated gem of a film
<START> i went into this movie with semi high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood and this nearly wrecked that love for me jason lee david seville in the film is horrifying i understand it can't be easy to act with cgi characters who aren't actually there but i really found his performance atrocious along with all the other non animated characters the chipmunks were adorable yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film if you feel you must see this film rent it at the most it is not worth eight bucks to see it in theaters unless you'd like a good laugh at the horrible acting
<START> perhaps i'm being too generous when i give this film two and a half stars out of five but there was an occasional moment however as an american werewolf movie this one is a missed chance there are no real plot connections to the superior original to speak of but the story is similar in some ways to london br br possible spoiler warning american kids go to foreign country one falls in love with a beautiful girl another one of the kids gets slaughtered by a werewolf in the same night that one gets bitten and despite his undead friend's warnings by the light of the full moon he sprouts fur fangs and claws br br but there are some differences in the story for one the girl is one of the werewolves second there are three american kids and third there's some weird werewolf cult intent on taking over the world as crazy as it sounds that last one wasn't a joke spoiler ends br br the films suffers from many things first the weak acting drags it down immensely tom scott's performance is amatuerish at best and he and julie delpy who plays his love interest don't seem to have any chemistry together at all second a weak script that seems to be all over the place many elements of suspense and dark comedy that made the original one great are missing in this one and whoever said that eating out the heart of the werewolf that bit you will change you back human last i heard this wasn't part of werewolf lore at all third terrible special effects the werewolf effects are done with computer animation which works for things such as dinosaurs ghosts and space ships but seems choppy fake and artificial when used for furry creatures like werewolves br br however there were a few things that saved this one from total there's one hilarious scene in a paris cafe when andy scott is having coffee with delpy he drops a bunch of condoms on the table and tries to pass them off as chewing gum by chewing and blowing a bubble also the soundtrack a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like bush and smashmouth although none of the songs have the word moon in their title like the original movie the soundtrack is great nontheless and another funny scene when a rotting corpse played by julie bowen attempts to whistle and her eyeball pops out had me laughing out loud br br but as a whole this film seems to lack the wit and suspense of the original and the overly contrived ending doesn't help it out much either br br 1 2 two and a half out of five stars average
<START> for many months i was looking forward to this release the previews looked good early reports on the net were encouraging and golden eye and were excellent shooters by the same people it turns out i was greatly misled haze had the potential to be up there with call of duty 4 and other next gen shooters however it looks plays and feels like something from 5 years or so ago i played haze on a tv and was initially disappointed that the game's developers had limited the graphics to the haze universe lacks detail and atmosphere the feeling of they must have really rushed to finish this is always there br br the controls are sluggish and cumbersome and i have yet to find an adjustment for x y axis sensitivity there are many parts of the single player game that are very dark visually to the point where you can't actually see where you are going why not add a torch function like in halo or even better night vision the use of the performance enhancing drug nectar is interesting however just as you get used to it you switch sides and don't use it again why bother i could go on with many more haze faults but instead i'll just say don't bother wait for 2 or play call of duty 4 and try to unlock the gold ak
<START> i was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating this was a big disappointment this doesn't hold a candle to contemporary zombie flicks like shaun of the dead day of the dead land of the dead etc horror flicks sometimes take a while to get going you have to build up the characters so when they snuff it you feel some empathy etc but even so there's a full 45 minutes to sit through here even before you sniff a corpse up to that point its like watching a bad soap opera nothing of any interest or relevance happens and if you are going to watch this for the first time you can honestly start watching after 45 minutes you won't miss anything plot wise when things do get going its all very sub par stuff some of the kills and make up are done well others are done very poorly consistency is lacking here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most wooden acting i've ever seen br br this could all be passable if you really believed this was all taking place on a plane but with guns being fired firebombs being let off no pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm yet the plane stays in the air c'mon we're not all simpletons br br oh and does it really take a whole minute for a fighter jet's missile to hit a plane that is a few hundred yards away i know its a zombie film and you have to stretch things but this film along with the other main defects listed above had zero credibility one to miss
<START> this series made for is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968 primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son br br based on a background of historical events such as the may 1968 student uprising in france the decaying franco regime the war in viet nam the rise of imperialism and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment br br generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can those times as it should be stated anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is occupied in other things br br the best thing that can be said of this series is ana as mother of three children she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant especially noticeable among women of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart without any resorting to the use of the brain as we say in spain common sense is one of the least common senses imanol arias offers very little apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series indeed as an actor he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series his resources are too limited however his part as father of the working class household is not at all bad br br not really recommendable for other audiences even spanish speakers in latin america the themes are all too related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers
<START> i wrote an essay in 1981 the year i graduated high school called the last american virgin i also had a friend named nancy who was the prostitute in this film apparently her daughter got a hold of my essay one night when she slept over my house a year later i wake up one morning and see the advertisement for this film i was 18 years old based the essay on experiences in my life the film is a bit different from my essay but definitely taken from it i did not have any proof of this matter except my english teacher mr versace who gave me an a on my essay i let it go never did anything about it i figured what comes around goes around i still would not take any action against anyone involved in this film i just needed to get it off my chest as i really never told anyone about it except my closest friend they agreed to keep it a secret the same year it came out i saw nancy in a market she actually had the nerve to ask me if i had any good stories or scripts for her to look at i guess thats what hollywood is all about getting stories from wherever you can it was interesting seeing parts of my life on the big screen though br br ghost writer
<START> first thing i note is the music it's nothing as amazing as ruggero deodato's cannibal holocaust's haunting theme or the masterpiece waltz from a tale of two sisters but i don't let that stop me so early in the film br br one must assume that the woman researching her hypothesis for her phd dissertation that cannibalism as a organized practice has never existed one would think they must take into the consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip accordingly right or why go at all if you already believe the hypothesis to be true before even being tested that's fairly unbelievably ignorant and makes the movie seem that much more unrealistic and badly scripted br br that actually is similar to the ruggero deodato's film just totally ill prepared no guns no decent hiking clothing just nonsense through and through br br people don't go on trips like this for college without months of planning and preparation br br but i digress br br things don't get off to a very good start for our brave yet stupid adventurers as they swerve to miss a iguana and their decoy pet ferret falls out of the truck nearly to it's demise then to fall into a mud hole well i guess it's time to walk br br okay then they flip a coin to see whether they keep going or forget the whole thing how does that scene even make any sense all their conviction rests on the flip of a coin after they must've spent time and money and preparation just getting out there this just keeps getting worse some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever concocted for the film industry br br mike talks about how he and his friend's were captured by the cannibals and put into cages in mud pits with 3 inch long leeches sucking on their blood i found that interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into in the jungle a man they mistake as a simple native is sitting on the ground eating such leeches wonder if they are the same ones really though this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless considering the content they just agree to off themselves rather then get eaten by cannibals like it's no big decision br br obviously mike is insane but just like in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior it's simply unrealistic br br ruggero deodato's movie easily feels the americans got what they deserved while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what befalls the americans yet again br br and because of that the movie feels somewhat pointless we already got the point from the first movie so why was the sequel made the name is rizzo could it get any worse oftentimes with movies such as these when you look up the cast you find they haven't really acted in much other films and their bios are all but non existent so you can imagine i was surprised to find giovanni lombardo in this movie who was in scorsese's gangs of new york now lt rizzo looked familiar and i found he was in the 2002 movie spiderman as a very tiny role as a tugboat captain reminds me of how william shatner went from being the admiral on the uss enterprise to a cop in a car irony sometimes irony works out shatner never could get the music right until his recent album has been which is really good just like bono of u2 never could get a haircut right and dan marino never could win no br br sometimes irony is just sad like christopher reeve superman can't walk irony the man will always be a legend though because he was such a great guy i digress yet again though br br at this point you can tell i'm fairly bored of even discussing cannibal ferox br br cannibal holocaust's message was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil what the savages do in natural living unknown to our moral records or what we do to others with malicious intent cannibal message seems to be 'be careful what you go looking for for you just might find it ' i will say this for cannibal ferox when gloria comes back and writes her dissertation asserting that cannibalism does not exist she saves others who would be curious and go where angels fear tread but overall this movie was really bad br br 10
<START> sequels are a capricious lot with most nowhere near the stature of the original sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original some critics such as john charles have stated that project is better than the original i disagree somewhat but this movie is still a worthwhile follow up and fits well in the output of brilliant hong kong action cinema in the 1980s as well as jackie's own oeuvre i do wonder how with such an awesome release of great films that his later films were not as good he only has directed two films in the 1990s and none past that but he has had much clout in many of the films where he is not officially the director br br earlier in 1987 jackie had brain surgery following a disastrous fall in the filming of armour of god this encouraged him to work on his next film close to home this did not encourage him to stop risking his life and his stunt team for our amusement what resulted is a smash hit at home that eclipsed the original in box office 31 million hk dollars compared to 19 million for the original br br jackie chan is once again police officer extraordinaire dragon ma and he is ordered to work with three wan superintendent chun lam wai royal warriors who is the only chinese police officer allowed to have a gun yet is thought to be staging arrests to make himself look better and ignoring the crimes of a triad lord named tiger au michael chan wai man dragon lord apparently chun has too much power to be taken down directly but he is relieved of the sai wan district now he is two wan which dragon ma takes over this inefficient and corrupt office will soon get a makeover and there is a great scene where three officers who do not know who they are dealing with attempt to assault ma to teach him a lesson about complaining about police officers he soon has that district ship shape and tiger au taken care of the fight choreography and stunts with tiger and his men are quite awesome my favorite stunt was a beautifully brutal fall from the second floor into a large vase and that vase did not appear to be soft br br meanwhile a couple of subplots are happening there are pirates who have survived from the first film who are looking for revenge and food then there are revolutionaries including maggie maggie cheung in the mood for love and rosamund kwan casino raiders who are trying to raise funds for dr sun yat sen to overthrow the qing government as well as government operatives who are trying to find these rebels throw in a mixture of corrupt hong kong and british cops as well as legitimate ones and you have a stew that is getting a bit too many ingredients but yet still seems to coalesce this works well when there is a marx brothers influenced scene the marx brothers have done this type of scene a few times with the 1929 being the first at maggie's place where everyone is looking for someone while hiding from someone else many weeks were spent on this scene alone and the effort certainly shows br br there are several faults with the film there is a certain didactic nature that creeps in the film that seems a bit out of place Â especially one small speech towards the end that jackie gives when dealing with the mainland revolutionaries and the extremely easy conversion of the pirates that survived from the first film female characters are once again underused and under appreciated especially maggie cheung i was not as satisfied with the continuance of the plot as much as the first film either the individual scenes dominate my feelings for the film instead of thinking of this movie as a cohesive whole i do not fault the film for not being able to have sammo hung and yuen biao like the first though i have heard the main reason behind this was that those two were filming eastern condors but i do wonder if jackie could have waited a small while to get them to perform in this Â they would work together for the last time the following year in dragons forever but they are missed br br i found this to be quite an enjoyable and well made film and it is rightfully regarded as one of the better comedic action films of the 1980s this film is also quite good in a few unexpected places the art direction is superb eddie ma the costumes are exquisite the cinematography is good and the movie looks quite authentic but the stunts comedy and the action is what i remember this film for there is a chase involving a handcuffed dragon and chun that is superb part of the axe throwing scene would be used in shanghai noon the last twenty minutes is full of awe inspiring hits falls chili peppers as a mouth mace jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used real peppers in this scene you can see him in a lot of mouth pain during the outtakes at the end and is a worthy conclusion to this movie the most famous stunt from this sequence is his homage to buster keaton from steamboat bill jr 1928 with the exception that there is no hole and only a weak section where his head pops through br br fans of jackie and or hong kong action cinema should consider this a must own and watch i certainly do
<START> tremendous fun both as a film and as an excuse to sit back and play the 'oh that's name' game every star of the golden age of english films seems to be in this one and it was a joy to see them and the greatest of them all richard was as tremendous as ever br br there is actually a plot that trundles along very nicely there's also some splendid jokes and comedic moments but the key to this films triumph is the characters within it alastair sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six foot big boned scotsman could be the headmistress of a girl's boarding school george cole beryl reid and irene all have their moments but with alastair and richard the star of the show is joyce she is an absolute one off and brings a smile whenever she's on the screen her rolling walk and plum accent done to perfection br br and for those playing the that's name' game you can even spot arthur barbara windsor and ronald if you look carefully
