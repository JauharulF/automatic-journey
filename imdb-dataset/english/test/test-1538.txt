<START> i guess i have to write something here although i think my one summary says it all i'm not a huge ted danson fan nothing against the man just hasn't done it for me this covers the sides of swift's novel that were never covered before you can tell the cast was having a wonderful time filming this
<START> in the 1940s veronica lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom thanks to her sultry beauty and her highly exploited hairstyle she starred opposite big names like alan ladd and march scoring screen successes in films like this gun for hire and i married a witch she held her own with female stars as well and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in so proudly we hail but changing times and her own failings caught up with her and by the end of the decade her heyday was over with two unsuccessful marriages behind her and two more in her future veronica headed for new york city where she made occasional television and summer stock appearances before dropping completely out of sight it was briefly big news when she was found working as a barmaid in a second rate hotel in the early sixties but by now her longtime alcoholism and years of hard living had robbed her of her looks without them public interest in her soon faded again she did return to the stage in assorted vehicles but her success was minimal eventually she relocated to miami florida where she lived in relative obscurity in 1966 she went to canada for a part in an obscure movie called footsteps in the snow which had no u s release the following year she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature they approached her to star in their film time is terror and convinced her to invest in the project as one author put it if ever a movie queen suffered a terminal comedown this was it surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values she failed even to rise to a minimal level in this miami florida shot quickie looking utterly ordinary in long shots and luridly aged in close ups poor veronica didn't act so much as walk through her part as a deranged doctor who has hit upon a successful youth restoration formula using flesh eating maggots she looks both bored and confused her most unintentionally hilarious moment coming when she is forced to ad lib while she struggles to don a pair of rubber gloves the supporting cast is no help at all merely advancing the plot by talking it to death director brad apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was pointed at them no need for anything resembling entertainment there is admittedly one unintentionally hilarious scene involving a private detective nurse and a corpse in a wheelchair that predates at by almost 20 years according to veronica herself the film was shelved for three years because no master shots were filmed but in 1970 the production company scraped it together changed the title to flesh feast and released it to cash in on lake's just published biography and because former leading ladies such as bette davis joan crawford and olivia de havilland had unexpectedly revived their careers in horror movies this travesty was promoted as veronica's comeback film this seems a strange course of action for the filmmakers to pursue though because it's unlikely that the young audience for a horror film of this quality either knew or cared who veronica lake was as expected it did nothing for veronica's career and she died in poverty three years later a previous reviewer cites a scene in which the female detective working undercover as a nurse in the doctor's laboratory overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue enlists the help of a multi talented chauffeur to cut up the body parts poor mrs lustig she sighs i hope she doesn't mind leaving her body to science try not to think about it advises the chauffeur sawing away i guess you are right hans concludes the detective nurse what is done is done what a sad end to the career of a still fondly remembered star
<START> dubbed beyond comprehension the hbo version of is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent film some scenes simply don't make sense in english and the actors bring zero energy to their voice reading add in the self censorship involving cia operative frank carlucci and you have a film stripped of both its drama and its power here's hoping the subtitled version gets to american television screens at some point
<START> behind the nostalgic music we see a young boy get off a train he is arriving from yugoslavia to meet his father a man he has not seen in a decade at the train station we meet the man he never smiles br br thus we begin our journey into four friends arthur penn's powerful and amazing film you may ask why i began my review that way well that is the way the video box describes the film you may have figured out that the film will be the story of the boy trying to get along with this emotionless man and eventually he will peel away at his cover and expose the kindness br br well if you bought that i've got a bridge i want to sell you you see modern hollywood would make that film penn has always been an outsider and has never resorted to typical cliched storytelling he always tells interesting stories about people his credits include bonnie and clyde the chase alice's restaurant and the underrated mickey one and four friends is no exception br br a typical hollywood film would focus on the boy who is named but steve script only focuses on that for about 4 minutes and then abandons him we meet the adult played by craig wasson whom you may recognize from body double and nightmare on elm street 3 and his friends tom david and the passionate georgia the movie takes us throughout the sixties now in a lesser film the events would receive the attention but in four friends these events happen but penn and is more concerned with character study than plot and i think the film is better that way we know the events we don't need to dwell on them again br br i know i haven't described much of the plot but i don't know if you can describe four friends it's not one of those high concept films that can be described in a single sentence it's a film of many moods and textures it's also a genuinely emotional experience the final twenty minutes of this film moved me to tears i'm not ashamed to admit it rarely does a film have such power that it can reduce me to tears the acting is first rate especially by craig wasson who seems to be one of the most underused actors working today this is such a difficult emotional performance and wasson pulls it off he should have received an oscar for this another great performance is by jodi who has an even more difficult role than wasson but she handles it extremely well and gives georgia a certain dignity most hollywood actresses wouldn't they'd be too scared to even try they'd be more concerned with image rather than giving a great performance that's not what acting is about she also deserved an oscar br br four friends didn't receive much of a push in 1981 maybe people just didn't have the emotional capacity to handle it and clueless executives couldn't push it as another american graffiti it lacks the wallop of four friends so they let it die too bad for this is one of the very best films of the 1980s a decade where more and more slick trash was created and great art like this was without a home i ask you to give this film a chance br br out of 4 stars
<START> in a while 4kids brings new shows to it's company for the past few years they brought pure gold like kirby right back at ya or mew mew power but 4kids has been off catdog is one of the examples br br it's hard to write a negative comment without bashing the show but in truth is pure garbage it revolves around a group who with an over active brain the catch though is anything he thinks up comes bad it may sound good on paper but after watching it you'll realize how far from good this show is br br the pizza guy is an extremely dumb character he's very 1 dimensional there's really not much to him he's hyper active end of story though many feel all the character are a rip off of the south park i think just the contrary from high school is an interesting character and he's able to make me laugh fail to do either of the two br br the cast for the show isn't any better like mom they suffer from lack of character they only stick to one characteristic and thats it the only redeeming quality is the fact that the show can cause you to smirk whether it's that the scene may actually be funny or you may just smirk because how stupid it is br br is a very crappy show from disney 4kids though it does seem to love some fans it should really be left to the kids
<START> i attended a screening of 'the at the toronto film festival this year while the other reviews i've read seem to be generally and mystifyingly positive i must tell you without any kind of axe to grind that this film is unimaginably unspeakably bad the very brave and candid performances by william h macy and maria bello have been horribly misspent on what is probably the least polished most clichÃ©d script to have received the green light in years i don't know how bad the brown bunny was but i'm certain it couldn't have attained the dante style depths that this one did as courageous as their performances were perhaps the bravest thing these otherwise brilliant actors did was to themselves to such a dreadful director and abysmal screenplay br br he must pitch pretty well in the boardroom because he should never been permitted to be within a hundred yards of a camera the dialogue is so embarrassingly contrived and clumsy that i actually found myself blushing during the screening i am mortified that the talents of macy have been totally squandered in the hands of someone whose direction is as incompetent as his writing br br watching gifted actors like alec baldwin labor through kramer's appalling script and ham fisted direction was akin to watching a baby seal get clubbed to death i felt angered helpless and sickened all at the same time although i am always glad that there are investors and industry people willing to take risks on quirky scripts with interesting premises this picture was a total utter fiasco kramer couldn't have been crueler to these actors if he had himself taken a steel pipe to their knees i hope for their sakes they can all avoid similar humiliations in the future macy wisely ducked out the side door and didn't even stick around for the screening regrettably it seems that the bad luck of main character has rubbed off on the picture in the worst possible way anyone accustomed to quality independents will likely find it completely unbearable
<START> often when tv series are transferred to the big screen they lose their appeal not in this case the historical accuracy in costumes equipment and general art direction like the tv series is outstanding a good example of comedy and farce with excellent script and comedy actors in the right parts based on a classic tv series that stands alone in british tv comedy history
<START> this movie will not be considered for an academy award but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment you'll enjoy a send up of darth vader for the villain the breather a female batman for the heroine but much cuter with much less costume and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny not by any means a great cinematic achievement but if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing god help me i liked it
<START> countenance antoine in a copycat impersonation of kevin smith's silent bob keeps asking for it but writer director christian never listens just can't say no to a joke no matter how cheap the best thing about this movie is its soundtrack of course joey burns of and the divine jonathan richman understated old school bard of there's something about mary fame would grace any small town dropout story in visual allure stefan lukas looks cool enough riding his tan six series bmw two door wearing aviator shades going nowhere true he accidentally sleeps with his wild eyed bohemian kid sister marie but then who wouldn't thumbs up also to how he goes black and white on a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zero zero but if you're looking for a slightly more serious rendering of what intoxication can do to you i suggest you check out fear and loathing in las vegas
<START> this is the first pepe le pew cartoon and in some ways it's very similar to the later ones but in a few other odd ways it is not while the object of pepe's affections is a cat oddly it appears to be a boy cat this whole predicament occurs because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dresses up like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk so it can be left alone unfortunately this attracts our hero pepe most of the action is pretty typical until the very funny and unexpected ending and this actually makes this one of the best of all cartoons in the series excellent animation though the style is different than later examples excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this one a keeper
<START> this is slightly less sickening than the first two films but otherwise it's business as usual a scuzzy sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema charles bronson is back blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood crime you see is up 11 in the south belmont area so what's to be done a stronger police presence tougher jails harsher sentences nope the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like bronson to out bloodthirsty revenge Â or as the writers would have it justice this time he's the personal killing machine of police chief ed lauter br br the writers bend over backwards to make the hero sending the useless cops into the area only to a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection and supplying a scene in which has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back to applause from the watching crowd capital punishment for theft well okay the attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer on or back him up is appalling br br sure these villains are scum but shouldn't the film leave the audience to make up its mind rather than the entire thing towards and his mindless answer funnily enough the beleaguered residents don't fear gang reprisals or blame for any of the violence which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of involvement at the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being br br the atrociously shallow performances don't help Â bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can't even put inflection on the right words new heights of stupidity are reached here Â a machine gun a rocket launcher Â and new lows of misogyny the movie contrives to every female character in sight whether by rape explosion or throat slashing and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion like one victim who ventures into the crime ridden gang controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger or another who goes shopping alone at night this is dreck pure and simple mindless garbage put together without style or sense
<START> the best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clichÃ©s it is rehashing snarling chinese gangsters a female vice president a duct that happens to be big enough to fit a big caucasian male shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy a situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent armageddon independence day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball the vice president in a nice well lighted room surrounded by subordinates while the chinese premier virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining snarling as viciously as the slimy gangsters a lone hero left alone in a ship building airplane whatever wreaking havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons etc etc etc br br the second best way is to count how many zeroes you need to put after the decimal to accurately gauge the probability of the film scenario i counted up to 45 a president agreeing to a meeting on board a private vessel the impossibly non command from the nuke box the part where the chinese decided to play shoot 'em up etc etc man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen br br i admit the film was interesting until the point the evil taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president then the boredom kicked in suspension of disbelief ceased and i started thinking the fun i'd have torturing this film
<START> i thought this movie was perfect for little girls it was about a magical place where genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they'd like most little girls would like this story even though there is the thought of death in it although no one dies the king almost does but little girls would not understand it so it adds up to make a perfect story all the events add up creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough this story is perfect for little girls and since it is a barbie movie the kids can have more fun with it especially if they have barbies of their own anyone can have fun with it though because it is so cute and understandable overall i think this movie is a good movie for everyone especially little girls and will give anyone a smile at least once during it
<START> moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy br br one of kramer v kramer's great strengths is its screenwriter director robert benton who has marvellously adapted avery corman's novel to the big screen he keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic while delivering all the drama straight from the heart his talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with places in the heart where he showed as in kramer v kramer that he has a natural ability for working with children br br the picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine academy award nominations two of them walking away winners one of those was dustin hoffman best actor who is superb as frustrated business man ted kramer a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person as said wife joanne meryl streep claimed the supporting actress oscar for a strong sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage also nominated was jane alexander for her fantastic turn as the kramer's good friend margaret final word in the acting stakes must go to young justin henry whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again and a thoroughly deserved oscar nomination came his way br br brilliant also is nestor cinematography and jerry timely editing while musically henry purcell's classical piece is used to effect br br truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves they grow together come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life and slowly comes to realise why joanne had to go br br certainly if nothing else kramer v kramer demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child especially not the child himself br br saturday june 10 1995 t v br br strong drama from avery corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction both from robert benton it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner br br hoffman is brilliant as ted kramer the man torn between his toppling career and the son whom he desperately wants to keep excellent too is streep as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person in support of these two is a very strong jane alexander as mutual friend margaret an outstanding justin henry as the boy caught in the middle and a top cast of extras br br this highly emotional heart rending drama more than deserved it's 1979 academy awards for best film best actor hoffman and best supporting actress streep br br wednesday february 28 1996 t v
<START> black comedy isn't always an easy sell every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful like fargo for example but usually they don't often find big audiences people seem to either set their minds for comedy or for serious mayhem there doesn't seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both throw momma from the train was a fairly decent hit yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age danny devito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987 br br devito plays an odd mamma's boy named owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with the mother is played by anne ramsey who passed away shortly after this was released and she is quite a caricature she is loud ugly rude and overbearing though owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself he wants desperately to have his mother offed he fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes but he clearly doesn't have the guts to actually do it himself that's where billy crystal comes in crystal plays larry donner owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college larry is a paranoid would be intellectual novelist who claims his ex wife stole his novel and made millions off it he is currently trying to write a new one but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence the night was owen hears larry wish his ex wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria and borrowing the idea from strangers on a train owen decides to travel to hawai'i and murder larry's ex wife once it appears he has done so he expects larry to return the favor and kill his mother the resulting action is often quite funny and even poignant it's certainly never dull and often full of surprises br br the acting is exceptional even if ramsey was a bit over the top crystal is as good as he can be and devito has always been undervalued as a performer the film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works often painfully so the film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes and the off beat tone is truly refreshing i have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film making throw momma from the train takes chances both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot how many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered the film isn't too long and it is chock full of laughs writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone 9 of 10 stars br br the hound
