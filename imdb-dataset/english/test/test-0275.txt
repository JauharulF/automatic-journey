<START> very good starring dick which in a way kind of reminded me of hawks' only angels have wings 1939 in which also acted this film was directed by masterful william wellman who was responsible for the landmark aviation silent picture wings br br plays a devil may care airplane pilot who is a blamed for an aviation accident afterwards he meets and falls for pretty sally who participates as part of an act in an itinerant air circus but when brother appears in scene a triangular relationship ensues br br central airport has many thrilling moments and some moving and touching scenes too thanks to the great chemistry that develops between and who in my opinion in this film resembles very much actress dorothy tom brown is good as brother fresh from his success in wyler's tom brown of culver br br great special effects good flying stunts swiftly paced film in all highly entertaining don't miss it when tcm airs it again
<START> i will start by saying i have always been a bonnie hunt fan she always adds life to any character she plays and she did a wonderful job in her directorial debut br br i have to admit this is a chick flick but keeping that in mind it is a wonderful story it touches on many emotions and elicits all sorts of reactions br br this film depicts real life like people with real life like situations tho i have to exclude the coincidence that is the major part of the film br br it's a love story not just of a man and a woman but the love of family friends and loved ones past even pets br br i really enjoyed it well worth the rental or the purchase
<START> cruddy innocent no smoking drinking or bikers but jeremy slate good actor and jocelyn lane good actress make this feasible for a bad biker flick post biker exploit time they knew it we knew it adam roarke and slate are wasted but they lived on br br a 3 out of 10 best performance jocelyn lane lane is the only really to catch the final exploit biker film after run angel run which also has good actors like don stroud etc it was over they knew it they were trying to make a living but jocelyn lane from two elvis bad flicks tickle me and something bad one in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with j slate fighting for honor it's worth seeing but it sucks but check it out well worth non biker non smoker non boozing biker types with hot chicks
<START> it says a lot about the united kingdom when television programmes like this not only get made but also run for three series unfunny politically correct to the point of sickening and poorly acted and written meera syal has not been funny or accomplished in anything that she has been in go on tell me i am wrong and jasper carrott funny guy as he is is well past his eighties prime this is such a bad comedy that it could have been made by itv but even stinkers like the upper hand and the one with james bolam as a car park attendant look like fawlty towers compared to this rubbish i would love to sit down with the writer director of this show so that they can point out the humour in this programme admittedly the majority of the uk's population is made up of poorly educated but this would not tickle their funny bones that's if they could tear themselves away from big brother or from their mobile phones but that's another story complete and utter dirt
<START> being cornish and brought up with the history of tin mining this film is quite special to me filmed in and around various locations in cornwall it depicts the story of two your children who get trapped down a mine with a group of miners br br the of the title refers to the ghosts of child miners who reside in the mine and are said to bring evil to all that mine there events take place with an american wanting to invest in local tin mining but when the young local kid josh is plagued by sightings of the ghost of a young boy he and his american 'girlfriend' set out to unravel the mystery behind his death climaxing in the rescue of themselves and several miners from almost certain death when a new shaft is opened and the save them br br top film albeit low budget and short but worth a look if you're from cornwall and or into tin mining
<START> who's the man what's that i hear a resounding cry of kevin well if you didn't shout for the 'usual suspect' i'd recommend changing your medicated prescription anyway this is no first class movie just a very well produced story that is almost believable considering its about an alien your probably wondering what the all acting is top stuff and also the first i've seen a balanced sarcastic alien just enjoyable is all i can say and almost for the whole family if not for the scene later in the movie seven stars
<START> more of a character study then a movie committed is yet just another relationship romp with the trimmings specifically made for a young target audience the direction seems very basic with obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of the lost loser versus the clueless committed committed is watchable at times and there is a small feeling of originality from lisa krueger br br committed is completely aimless for the first twenty minutes we get to know but the movie picks up when her husband disappears sets off to find him br br some parts are strange other times the movie drags the second half is more humorous as we see spiritual antics take a turn for the more intense the annoying guitar music is awful but perhaps a necessary evil as committed offers very little anyway an average movie hampered by some completely pointless moments committed 's only asset is heather graham and patricia velazquez
<START> admittedly i am not a fan of the monogram chan films the plot involving radium theft from a bank vault is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric mysteries that fox produced mantan moreland and benson fong as no 3 son tommy provide some laughs as usual but otherwise there isn't much here great title that is wasted
<START> feeling minnesota is one of the worst films i have ever seen it is also one of the most disgusting films ever made it has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mob man at the wedding she meets his brother they have sex in the house after they eat the cake than decide to run away together the other brother of course comes after him guns blazing and he kills his wife wakes up to find her corpse in the bathtub and buries her he than seems to become friends with and they try to get money together because someone is blackmailing them because he saw them and the body this loops about and several characters dies or come back to life but it never comes together with anything that could be called a good plot the performances are horrible by pretty much everybody cameron diaz keanu reeves and dan the direction dialogue and visual effects are just horrible a disgusting and horrible movie
<START> the plot was really weak and confused this is a true oprah flick in oprah's world all men are evil and all women are victims
<START> i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences i guessed the film will be interesting in fact isn't at all not so much profound for a such subject eternity never ending life experiences after death and the film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all at least not express yet it's so naive charming film but naive film a must to avoid the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store it's a pity 'cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn't so much profound about it
<START> avoid this film if you are looking for entertainment br br it is filled with wannabes trying to be something that they are not and emraan is just wasted in the role of a tour guide who falls for a newcomer who needs to go to acting school seriously where to they get these people from just because you're pretty doesn't mean you can act or should be an actress br br patel needs to send an apology letter to everyone who accidentally watches him makes a fool of himself in this poor excuse for a film he plays an insipid wannabe gangster who drugs girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them off to the highest bidder
<START> yes watch this movie if you like brave films this is maybe the best mexican picture since alley just because the excellent cast the outrageous direction and a sublime soundtrack many people did not like they think it's very aggressive but they didn't understand that it was just a representation with hyper realism of the mexican society but so similar to all the third world families i hope that benjamin cann and bruno bichir who in this movie gives another example of his greatness as an actor soon get together again with a new film just remember how los olvidados luis buÃ±uel was misunderstood when released but now we consider one of the best movies of all times please prepare yourself and watch this film
<START> considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history someone had to be the first one could make a case that in shoulder arms charlie chaplin invented the genre br br hard to believe that back then this was a daring move when you consider that some of the best films involving such people as bob hope abbott costello laurel hardy involved military service and made during war time it's just something you accept and laugh at br br in the first world war chaplin along with fellow stars douglas fairbanks and mary pickford went out on bond tours he was a great supporter of the allied cause unusual for someone of his left wing views it would seem only natural that the tramp would be drafted and unfortunately would around and wreak havoc on all br br a lot of things you'd see in the service comedies of world war ii got their start in shoulder arms chaplin had no more imitators because within a few weeks of the film's release the war was over br br but a comedy art form had been established by one of comedy's greatest geniuses
<START> telly savalas hams it up as the mexican revolutionary though he's matched by chuck connors as a military martinet in this jokey yet rather boring pastiche on the famous historical figure's life and times an earlier attempt villa rides 1968 with yul brynner in the role and co starring robert dealt with these events more soberly and on a grander scale as such pancho villa is an all too typical european venture and an undistinguished one at that despite its credentials the end result is more often silly rather than amusing though a few moments most notably the action set pieces and a scene involving a brawl inside a church offer some mild pleasure oh and savalas even gets to sing over the end titles
