<START> in reality that happened the royal mother in law and father in law with the couple the day after the wedding and gave her the money in public this troubled young elisabeth so much that she never forgot the issue we must remember she was only 16 she was so embarrassed that she kept a fear for sex all her life perhaps this began to appear as a trauma also the constant meddling of her aunt and mother in law as you say she kept all her children away from her critiqued her teeth and manners which she considered inappropriate for an empress and when sissi finally went to venice with her husband and children her eldest daughter died and the mother in law blamed her for that unfortunate and premature death she never recovered
<START> this movie is a warning to all people sat surfing the internet on a typical day at the office my warning is do not reveal too much about yourself 2 be careful who you cross there are spies on this internet thing i thought that it was so scary what that man and woman combination did to poor angela bennett i did not realise that somebody could take ones life away in one click of this mouse angela i thought did a sterling job of jack and that awful girl my question is why does that computer make that noise when it works like a clicking sound mine does not do this or this one this film also tells you that there is fraud on this internet also why couldn't angela do the virus destroyer programme at a i also thought that like all computers the transfer rate to disk was slow that is correctly portrayed in this film when you save the programme to your floppy disk the bar only moved slowly i quite liked angela's house at the beginning of the film as well why did no one believe angela
<START> it just so happens that ivan the terrible parts i and ii both had entries in the 50 worst movies book by harry medved now i do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement though they are still both pretty poor films particularly the first one as it featured more eye rolling and googly eyed looks than i have ever seen before director eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film artsy and profound and since i am legally sane i must say that i hated this first film the second while still very incomplete looking is a vast improvement as eye rolling is minimal though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1 while part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour especially since it never gets to insane behavior later in life like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him it's no surprise that life story is left very incomplete even without all the truly awful behaviors of ivan apparently the supremely evil stalin still didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a huge waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing stalin as a crazy guy just like ivan br br by the way there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 without it a 2 and that's the scene with prince vladimir at the banquet it is well done and pretty funny in a dark way and the scene was done in a russian version of 2 color technicolor this is very odd by the way because by the mid 1930s a vastly improved true color process was developed by technicolor that no longer made everything look all red and greenish blue so this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film very odd indeed for the 1940s
<START> the first few minutes of this movie don't do it justice for me its not funny until they board the sub and those hilarious characters begin to gel i was born and raised in norfolk virginia and met my share of different sailors i even married one most of my favorite movies are just funny not topical not dependent on sex or violence and funny every time i see them groundhog day bruce almighty and down periscope are still funny even after i know the dialog by heart kelsey grammar with his god i love this job was sincere genuine and lovable rob schneider is hysterical as the crew gets back at him for being annoying i am still amazed at the size of that fishing boat next to a sub i can see why folks who live this life would notice the uh but its not a documentary after all its a comedy and i just love it
<START> the movie is great for venezuelan tourism birds birds and more birds only 1 piranha nice scenery the only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race the end when drowns is a definite hollywood prop there is no definite storyline it goes from venezuelan scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason who gets it in the end a very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with outtakes of venezuela william smith is a very talented actor that has made some very good movies like all actors they all need to have at least one bad film don't waste the 5 00 on the dvd
<START> like the previous two 'mad max' films 'mad max beyond is not exception to the violence and strange plot mad max is in a post war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to morrow land' this is generally a warped film with peter pan references and tina turner methane pigs and odd characters i got very bored by watching it all and it offered nothing to me i did not feel inspired after watching this film the only decent thing about this film were the extremely odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film it's too weird for me and it was much too dull
<START> a family is traveling through the mid west there's widower ben charles bateman his girlfriend nicky capri and ben's little daughter k t then hit a town named where everyone acts more than a little strangely their car breaks down and they're forced to stay they soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil br br the story is not that good people just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end the acting is pretty poor too bateman and capri are bland and everybody else is about the same only old pros martin and l q jones give good performances still this movie does work it forgoes blood and gore there's some but this is pg and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere the acting hampers a lot of it but it still works martin especially chews the scenery in his role i can't explain exactly why i sort of like this movie but it did work on me it's a quiet kind of horror that isn't made anymore hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered a 7
<START> a funny and scathing critique of russian society and culture during the transition from communism v also shows the west in an light a group of russians living in st petersburg a k a peter the window on the west find a magic portal that instantly transports them to paris film is truly hilarious and just weird enough constantly keep even the jaded film viewer on his toes the songs the dream sequences and the deliciously disgusting fringes of society from both cultures mingle to create a memorable and meaningful film anyone trying to understand the shift in russian cultural sentiments since the fall of the ussr should begin here
<START> as i write this user comment tim burton's interpretation of the sweeney todd tale is making big money at the box office and the film even earned a couple of oscar nominations if i'm not mistaken i haven't seen it yet but i sincerely hope burton didn't look for inspiration and or stylish trademarks in good old andy milligan's bloodthirsty butchers yes even though the title distinctively mentions butchers the main characters in the plot are a barber the infamous sweeney todd and a female baker together they form a vile alliance where he kills the customers in his shop and she processes the bodies into her famous london meat pies in other words an andy milligan premise at his most typical derivative delirious and amateurish i think the imdb rating for this film speaks for itself although the actual story definitely isn't the worst i've ever seen milligan somehow inexplicably attracts sheer ineptitude the production is one gigantic mess with an incoherent narrative structure truly hideous photography poor lighting lousy acting and directing laughable gore and zilch tension or atmosphere more than half of the footage is pure padding and words fail to describe how boring the film is even with a running time of a mere 80 minutes ed wood ted v mikels and bruno mattei you guys need not fear as none other than andy milligan is Â hands down Â the worst director ever but i don't think he cared maybe if you dispose of a really high level of tolerance bloodthirsty butchers is worth one viewing
<START> we arrived at the theater too late to see rendition which was our intention and 'the was the only film that hadn't already started i had an inkling of how bad a film it was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter the theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film started br br the screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports clichÃ© at the audience without creating a single laugh not one during the entire movie think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned if you add texas to the mix you ought to come up with the sports version of 'little miss sunshine' not a big yawn br br the first film that came to mind as we exited the theater was stop the music' by comparison this was stop the music' without bruce jenner valerie perrine or the village people br br if the film had a single grace note it was seeing matthew lawrence grown up
<START> one of the best film i ever saw br br the performance of louis jouvet is fantastic he really his part and this is wonderful he's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to take his part br br and both suzy and bernard blier are good as standard french people trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder br br the story is breathtaking and well built you can feel the ambiance of paris for that period which is about 1930 40 between two wars the clubs the old little buildings the neighbors br br all those things contribute to make a great movie
<START> this is easily the worst adaptation of greek mythology i've ever seen it utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to 3 or 4 i think it makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers' having ever read the myths like changing birds to harpies lions to the oracle of to and bulls to a pedantic version of even integrating aspects never seen outside of sam raimi's entertaining series concerning his first marriage to a woman with the co opted name of one of the furies so it sounds appropriate to the period br br i could accept much of that but it also fails completely in pure film standards most painful is the dialogue leaden portentous pseudo shakespearean tripe it is a poor re interpretation of the myths making a sad attempt at the kind of post modern revisionism that crichton's the 13th warrior attempted in regards to the beowulf legend while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super strength a sad sad failure of an entertainment experience who i'm sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply
<START> as a fan of the old series i must say that this is at best a parody of a much beloved series first the old series would at least attempt to follow some military structure i know in this p c world it is not the thing to do but hey don't turn it into the care bears in the old series was a soldier now he is a teenage mutant turtle another thing is the flying tank ok it flies out of the cobra base and bounces off the copter and they are both ok lets face it if the next one is not better this could spell the end of g i joe
<START> this is quite a bad movie but oh well this movie is at least not as lame as the third ghoulies movie br br yes this is a bad movie in terms of its writing directing acting and basically everything in between it has such a weak simple and ridicules story that besides has little to do with the previous ghoulies movie entries it tries to connect the movie with the first movie ghoulies from 1985 but then on the other hand if they really wanted to connect this movie with its predecessors then were are the ghoulies in this movie instead now we are having some small people played by tony cox and arturo gil dressed up as demons not that the ghoulies from the previous movies were any classic characters but they were nevertheless the heart and soul of the movie and also provided the movies with a certain amount of fun it's like having a gremlins movie without the gremlins br br the movie is not really interesting to watch because it lacks any tension good humor intriguing characters and basically everything else you can think off because it got put together by persons who obviously aren't the most talented ones within their business just like at director's jim wynorski resume with movies such as the witches of and its sequel alabama jones and the busty crusade house on hill scream queen hot tub party the bare wench project and the sequels the bare wench project 2 scared topless and the bare wench project 3 nymphs of mystery mountain and the da vinci coed on it br br yeah the movie is quite silly and campy but this is not really enough to boost this movie and gives it some more entertainment value you know it's the kind of cheap looking movie with some lame special effects costumes make up and actors nobody has heard of ever since br br still it isn't the worst movie out of the series because of the reason that ghoulies iii ghoulies go to college is by far a more worse movie since that one had some horrible lame attempts at humor this movie at least still does some attempts to be serious and professional one even though the end result is far from perfect br br bad movie making and perhaps only watchable for those who have seen the previous ghoulies entries br br 3 10
<START> i always hated this retarded show i liked the shows of cartoon network like dexter's laboratory or megas xlr but i never liked this piece of turd basically because it have stupid characters the good or the villains all seems to be mentally retarded they have stupid voices specially bubbles she is supposed to be the cute character of the show but she is incredibly annoying the story lines are very very stupid some episodes could have been interesting but almost always the show turns childish and corny there wasn't any likable character the music was horrible and the animation is the worst that i've seen five year old boy could draw better i don't see why all the world seems to love this piece of garbage the powerpuff girls seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made fortunately foster home for the imaginary friends from the same creator was far away better
