<START> the final frames of the original american graffiti provide one line summaries of the fates of the film's four central male characters while somewhat sexist in omitting the female characters the ending of the original film provided all the information about those people that even the most ardent fan of the movie would want however someone felt that mega bucks could be made by detailing the dreary lives of these characters after the original film ended bad move making an insurance salesman and his wife a nerdy private in vietnam a drag race driver and a overgrown hippie into interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this nearly unwatchable movie while most of the original cast is back with only richard dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away more american graffiti is a mess of silly situations that involve protests car races country singers and the vietnam war the use of split screens once thought innovative and daring is overused here to the point of distraction and adds confusion to the already confused goings one this is a sequel that demonstrates nearly everything that can go wrong with a sequel perhaps it should be screened in film schools as a lesson even the use of period music which was a delight in the original is poorly done here if you want more american graffiti see the original twice
<START> without a doubt one of the most racially prejudiced films i've ever seen with the prejudice being levelled against hayden panettiere as she has to move into a tough inner city school she is constantly called white girl and other slurs based on her colour firstly would this be allowed the other way around if a black girl was the butt of all the abuse and secondly the stereotyping of the ethnic kids from the inner city school is also a disgrace the writers apparent desire to show they were hip also extended to missing the point that the inner city school win the cheerleading competition not through talent but by intimidating their white opponents these overtones to the film took it away from it's expected direction of a harmless lighthearted comedy suitable for a family audience into a vehicle that does none of the participants any credit hayden panettiere has star quality but i would be surprised if any of the rest of the class ever get much further all in all a charmless film that was a waste of time
<START> i thought this movie was brilliant it was so funny and so true too a great idea for a movie five groups of friends on their way to i've got to say that matt newton as mason was probably my favourite character i wish i could give this movie more than a 10 rating
<START> i can't remember when i've seen a worse movie the acting was overwrought the dialog trite to the point of being painful to listen to the special effects second rate and the overall story laughable br br i've never wanted to walk out on a movie more and if i'd been alone that's what i'd have done about 30 minutes into it and saved myself nearly another two excruciating hours of nausea inducing dialog and a plot with more holes than a swiss cheese the size of texas i just can't what a miserable experience sitting through this waste of perfectly good celluloid was br br
<START> don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny it was a complete disaster and one of the worst movies i've ever seen ali g is only funny on channel 4's ali g show after watching his performance all i can say is he is not made for movies with a daft script or more like no storyline there's nothing to keep you entertained full of annoying unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way at the end of the film ali g gives a speech he mentions if you hated this film tell people it was good not even the speech could save the movie he probably knew its gonna be a stinker i would of given this a 0 10 but the minimum start is 1 overall don't even waste your time on this rubbish
<START> i've read anne frank the diary of a young girl when i was in high school and found myself completely engrossed in her story and also in the broadway play of her life in the secret br br however i'm a little perplexed about how people have perceived her diary and of her as a person seeing her as a little saint or having a message of hope for the world i don't think that was the original intention of her diary she wrote it mainly for herself even though she did make some rigorous rewrites before the occupants of the secret were betrayed intending it to be published someday br br but i never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope but as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and very entertainingly in a diary no doubt she was a very engaging writer and she did possess an extraordinary talent with expressing herself fully with words you really got to know her well through her diary but the importance of her diary lies in the fact that it is a testament and an important historical document of the proof that the holocaust did happen br br it also brought the tragedy of the holocaust closer to home to lose someone that we could put a familiar face and personality to at such a young age literally having had her young life ripped away from her and from the other occupants who were murdered in the holocaust it's a searing indictment of the nazis systematic murder of over 6 million jews and that should not be forgotten br br but it's sad to me that her diary is being so misconstrued as anything more than that when i look for hope i have the bible the first most widely read non fiction book in the world god's words in the bible is eternal but anne's diary is a diary of a young girl under extraordinary circumstances and that is it she is not someone to be worshiped or idolized because she was an ordinary girl with many flaws who possessed incredible talent as a writer and who died at age 15 from in the bergen concentration camp she was a victim of the holocaust and as this otherwise excellent documentary has so vividly testified she was hitler's most famous victim br br besides the anne frank's story the stories from her family members and friends and survivors of the holocaust were engrossing vivid and powerful i especially enjoyed testimony and marvel that she is still strong and alive today hannah testimony was also very interesting and i also liked hearing from otto frank but i also agree that the moving picture of the young girl with the dark hair and the familiar big eyes at the end was particularly memorable br br another thing about the holocaust that i kind of disagree with the documentary is that i don't believe it was just a matter of discrimination but rather something deeper and more profound and that was just an act of pure evil pure evil nothing else but pure evil br br excellent documentary of anne frank and of the holocaust that should be watched
<START> although many have mixed feelings about this latter day giallo thriller from argento it still stands as another lavish testament to the cinematic brilliance that is argento br br a young opera singer has her first break out performance and suddenly finds herself the subject of obsession for a crazed maniac br br in a way opera is like a modern day giallo take on phantom of the opera blended with all the glorious style and color that one would expect dario argento to deliver argento makes terrific use of inventive camera techniques reoccurring symbols like those ravens gothic atmosphere and truly gruesome murder sequences one scene especially which involves a peep hole and a gun will knock viewers right out of their seats story wise the film also manages to be gripping with some strong suspense and given great atmosphere by claudio simonetti's gorgeous music score br br the cast does some satisfying performances cristina is good as our leading lady the late ian charleson does a nice turn as the director as does as an investigator daria as agent and william mcnamara as ill fated lover br br opera is terrific latter day argento and perhaps the last of his great works it's sure to please his fans and even create some new ones br br out of
<START> lifeforce is an extremely schizophrenic movie based on colin wilson s novel the space vampires the script ignores most of the novel s concepts and structure indeed it owes more to the quatermass serials than the novel but the scenes it does leave in from the novel are nearly identical to those in the film and talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history it s though it was written in chapters by several different people take for instance carlson he disappears after the early shuttle scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the beleaguered brits and it s this lack of attention by the screenwriters that spoils the film and there s plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to london in a helicopter and not realising it has been over run by zombies untill they re flying over it br br i could go on at great length about these plot holes but lifeforce is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you don t use your brain it s good to see a sci fi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty human adults wouldn t get their hands on them the special effects and pyrotechnics are very very good there s lots of action and stunts and lifeforce features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl when mentioning lifeforce in conversation with males it s always a race to say seen the alien in lifeforce she can suck the lifeforce out of me anytime hardly surprising looking at the demographics of the votes that this film is more popular with males than females br br don t worry a naked girl can t escape from here can t she pity br br
<START> i went through boot camp at parris island in 1953 and this film is about as accurate a depiction of what boots went through in that era even to burying that sand flea many of the actors in the film were active duty marines this film may be more entertaining to marines than others but i feel the film itself is very well done and jack webb made a good di fi

<START> there wasn't much thought put into the story line on many fronts this is a good action movie but that's about it br br the movie states that the were kept to protect the vampires during the day yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks so they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can't do how does this protect the vampires during the day who are they protecting the vampires from the uncontrollable the slaves in human form are nothing more than peasants br br my understanding is that vampires are immortals and don't age yet sonya ages from child to adult do they just stop aging at a certain age i understand that viktor is old because he was turned as explained in the second movie but vampire babies age strange br br i didn't realize that vampires needed torches to see at night yet we see them carrying torches throughout the movie br br silver was the only thing that was supposedly able to harm yet wooden fired from the huge crossbows kill the too br br these are just some of the things that show just a lack of thought put into the story telling
<START> despite the excellent cast and the potential of the story this movie fails on many levels i was convinced that the director was a beginner the movie is very poorly edited shows a lot of non important and annoying flashes has very visible goofs and has no suspenseful atmosphere whatsoever the question which repeatedly popped up in my mind while watching this was so what i couldn't care less about the protagonist and what happens to him it's not that the story isn't compelling it's simply the way it's told the movie tells the story period it's like an actor who mumbles his lines without knowing what he's saying the movie simply tells the events that happen without any soul and the director's to blame he doesn't know how to make something interesting or suspenseful or enjoyable and believe me i'm not somebody who wants to see die hard 8 or 2 fast 2 crappy on the contrary i especially like slow paced movies so i was convinced the director was a beginner but to my amazement this man has years of experience and has worked as a cinematographer or camera assistant on a lot of marvelous productions guess he had a bad year back then
<START> last fall of 2001 i took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie mark his vast knowledge of filmmaking his ability to dissect any scene of a film and his winning of an academy award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director when he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called full ride and was in the post production stages my interest was piqued however that would be the last i would ever hear of that film project until last week br br last week i saw in a tv listing that full ride was going to be showing on the wb network this immediately raised a red flag as i can't help but associate wb with teensploitation shows such as dawson's creek charmed etc plus the fact that full ride was going to be released straight to tv wasn't too flattering in itself but nevertheless i set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher's creation br br after two hours passed and the end credits began to roll i thought long and hard about what i had just seen what i had just seen was a typical wb quality show stretched out to the length of two hours in fact it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the wb network critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical wb show br br where to begin the characters are shallow the story is cliche in every sense of the word the scenes are completely contrived and the character development is forced and unbelievable this movie just screams unoriginal ' br br the main character matt is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks literally who plays solid high school football as a but then fizzles off into a life of crime he is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail obviously without much of a choice he agrees to play football with an all star football team but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude br br then comes the love interest of course where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest she comes in the form of amy lear played by the beautiful meredith monroe she is actually a likable character as opposed to the ever so abrasive matt so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first but of course the inevitable comes to pass she falls for him changes his attitude towards everything and all seems good and happy but now it's time for conflict br br earlier in the movie amy makes it clear to matt that she doesn't want to score with him because it would be to her and her mother this is much to matt's dismay and his football buddies yes they eventually warm up to him who bet him he wouldn't get any but of course matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he's not all about the nookie here's where the exciting plot thickens if you don't want me to ruin this surprise then skip ahead br br begin spoiler br br matt finds out from some local guys that apparently amy lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the all star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria which is baffling in the first place and make it to the big city suddenly realizing he's been used and that his love was a sham matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before the big game ' amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time but he's too hot headed to buy it so what will matt do will he take her back or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all round jerk i won't ruin the super ultra surprising ending for you br br end spoiler br br so if i somehow got you pumped up for this movie please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm this movie is an uninspired version of varsity blues' or summer catch ' and that's not saying much there's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about so what do you have left not a whole lot br br what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture painted of nebraska through this film it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow the characters' high hopes for making in the big city' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated and it only further cements the stereotype of being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities i am unsure of whether or not intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight but i think he ended up with a very shameful product if wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he's shooting that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider if actually lived here you'd think he'd know better than that br br all in all i am completely disappointed in first big film and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought provoking
<START> i really enjoyed this epic thought not quite so much as the english patient a modern day classic the first 20 minutes or so feel awkward but as jude law embarks on the journey back to his love ava nicole kidman the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable thoughtful romantic drama apparently it is fashionable to hate kidman at the moment but i don't agree at all and she does well here i actually think that the romance between and ada is weakly developed in the script they really don t get much screen time together to develop a relationship but law and kidman give it their all and convince ada's journey is the crux of the film she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything zellweger at first seems all wrong as ruby but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later scenes the film has beautiful photography and set design but never really captures the true feel of a period piece jack white in particular has long hair and a pale that look completely out of place with the setting cillian murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented irish actor in an early bit part and natalie portman actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence it's a pity that in the other boleyn girl she's so inadequate
