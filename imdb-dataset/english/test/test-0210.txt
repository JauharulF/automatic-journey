<START> excellent performance there still are good actors around also great directing and photography very true to shakespear and a 'must' for all shakespear fans macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle out he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting helen is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil if you love death and decay and lyrics this is the one
<START> the d i 4 outta 5 stars wow i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie d i s as portrayed in full metal jacket or an officer and a gentleman boy was i wrong this is probably the best work webb has ever done far and away better than his one note dragnet performances the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you know that the guy means every word of it the story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray song you don't somebody else will webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever and he's under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen but by golly he sees a man buried somewhere in that and he's gonna drag him out kicking and screaming great stuff
<START> this is a movie about the music that is currently being played in istanbul istanbul was the center of the two old world superpowers the byzantine empire and the ottoman empire today it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million so it is to no ones surprise that a lot of music is being played in istanbul with a great variety of voices styles and influences from everywhere on the globe it is turkish music of course and i was fascinated by turkish music ever since i bought my first record long time ago the movie features different singers instrumentalists and bands spoken comments from the musicians nicely illustrate the music being played and the social context in modern turkey for my perspective the most interesting comments were from furthermore the movies shows urban scenery mainly from istanbul which is very pleasant to watch br br crossing the bridge is listed as a documentary and it includes music from minorities e g and roma other important topics are omitted such as turkish jazz music or music of the and greeks br br this movie is strongly recommended for lovers of the music and culture of turkey the balkans the eastern mediterranean and the middle east it may also be worthwhile for those with a keen interest in the global effects of musical styles such as rock and roll or hip hop
<START> full disclosure i was born in 1967 at first the premise tickled me after all if you were a teenager growing up in the age of reagan a trip down memory lane was worth a laugh or three pop rocks atari and rock 'em sock 'em robots loved 'em not despite the fact they were goofy but because they were goofy and silly and fun but when vh1 decided to make the series i love last tuesday i knew enough was enough goes hal sparks have nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter how idiotic are wait let me check hmmm no no it appears he doesn't snarky snotty uber hip posturing has its place but enough already
<START> another sadistic and ultra sleazy late 70's early 80's revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a rip off of other rip offs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders storywise this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director was to multiply the sleaze factor by a thousand this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isn't unsettling at all on the contrary these spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever the villains are wimps and the train passengers are so motionless they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be terror express should be in the porn section of videostores
<START> i pride myself in being able to sit through everything i think if i've paid the rental fee then i'm going to at least watch it i have found the exception to this rule the planet i don't know what the exchange rate is but reading through the other comments i can only guess that must be around 150 i'll date myself but this movie reminds me of the old steve reeves movies of the 50's he was a bodybuilder turned actor he was in these really awful italian dubbed movies that starred reeves as hercules or some other muscle bound hero as a kid watching them you couldn't quite articulate why these movies stunk you just knew they did mike mitchell is the new steve reeves that's it that's what this really was a new telling of an old italian spaghetti sand and sandals movie and i kid you not where was reeves born glasgow montana this movie isn't so bad that it's kind of fun to watch it's just plain bad
<START> now this is a movie i really dislike it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere the settings are not even attractive for the eye and do not serve for the movie's purpose br br the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks what did they do to our favorite toys br br the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f x are terrible br br i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs
<START> ok here is the deal i love action movies and generally have no problem suspending a great deal of disbelief over plot holes or other implausible actions however this movie went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous let me get this straight the police send a notorious gangster and cop killer along with a number of other prisoners on a bus with a grand total of two guards they then are forced to stop at a precinct where precisely two cops are working one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out apparently the building was about to be shut down so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the entire precinct got the night off for new year's eve right but wait it gets better gabriel byrne shows up to take out fishburne before he can rat him and other dirty cops out although we never find out anything about their relationship or dealings interestingly the cops launching the assault on the precinct are in full swat gear with night vision goggles assault rifles the whole nine yards later on they even bring in a helicopter with more people in full gear i'm not a cop but i'm pretty sure you can't just waltz out of the station with an entire swat platoon worth of equipment without someone asking what you are doing and the police helicopter in the supposedly terrible winter storm also no one near the precinct happens to hear or see this major siege going on with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire going off i mean seriously come on i know this is set in detroit but even there it would raise suspicion on a supposedly top secret mission i also love the fact that they find a tommy gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable br br i could live with some of these problems if there weren't other glaring issues also for one the opening couple minutes of the movie are shot nicely in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and i thought was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie unfortunately i was wrong the remainder of the film has no sense of pacing or tension or drama the characters don't relate to each other in any way which is probably largely due to the fact that they aren't particularly interesting there isn't enough interesting action to make this a good action movie and there isn't enough character development storytelling to make this a passable thriller drama the relationship between hawke fishburn is the only thing that the director even tries to make interesting or intense oh and by the way the final scene in the wilderness uh i thought this was in the middle of a run down industrial section of detroit and suddenly we are in the woods the acting isn't terrible in this movie it is just that the directing and writing are atrocious i really enjoy some of hawkes fishburne byrne other movies but this one is terrible
<START> un funny and un entertaining possibly the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to watch think goes to ' humour done even worse myself and my girlfriend sat through it just to see if it could be as consistently dire as it seems in the opening sequence yes it is avoid at all costs
<START> it's 3 30am br br i just saw this movie about six minutes ago and it is fantastic br br a teenage girl has a night of passion with her mom's lover and it ruins everybody's lives the really interesting thing about this movie is that you can't really place the blame on any one person br br everyone performed perfectly and the story was thought provoking br br you should definitely see this movie if you can get your hands on it br br i give it a 10
<START> a snore gore i saw this piece of horrible stinking worthless junk at the cameo movie house now the famous night club on washington avenue on south beach in 1980 or 81 i was 17 and my three buddies and i laughed at this horrible gross piece of trash the theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place they didn't miss a darn thing the worst acting ever these actors deserve the academy award for the worst and i mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema joke was the theater was showing another mi mi lay a great name at least stinker barf city enough said if you're under 12 years old you might get a few chills over 12 you will be snoring after the opening credits it's just amazing that anyone spent a cent on making this movie and to think it's considered a cult classic yuk
<START> i read the other comments here about this movie before watching it if you've read them you will know that they are almost all negative i really don't understand that i admit that it is far too long it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit the music is often inappropriate but strong performances by ford and thomas are indeed enough to carry this with all his fame as a movie star i'd forgotten that harrison ford really can act this role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable i find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was deception thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception her initial denial which leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous this movie is never going to be on anybody's list of great flicks but it isn't that bad i'm glad that i waited to see it on video but it is worth the 3 or 4
<START> this was obviously the worst movie ever made ketchup was the starring role in this movie and would be the only nominee for an award cause the plot actors and anything related to this farce was absolutely horrible and ridiculous i could have made a better horror flick in my backyard within two hours with a hand held camera using grass stuffed dummies as the actors atleast the acting would have been better don't waste your time or money on this one it's extremely cheesy and horrible
<START> i have to admit that when i first heard about the apocalypse film it was a worry br br i mean they have a lot to live up to don't they when they first did a stage show they won the perrier award and when they did radio they won a sony award when they ventured onto our they won a bafta award a royal television society award and the golden rose of montreux br br when the first series aired in january 1999 it was mind blowing a real breath of fresh air in british comedy and when the second series aired a year later it built on that foundation and sealed the shows cult status around the world our web stats show that we have received visitors from every single country on the planet the show for local people' showcased the gents talent for live performance and opened doors for the gents to do more live performing such as 'art' in the west end br br the fans favourite has always been the christmas special less of a sketch show and more a tribute to classic horror films yet still wrapped up in the delicious league style br br and then of course there was the third series still a hit with the loyal hardcore fans of course but maybe a little bit ahead of its time for a mainstream tv audience br br as i say a lot to live up to br br so now we have the film and well a film is different isn't it it will be seen by much larger numbers than the radio or tv shows and with the third series in mind i was worried br br well as you know i was lucky enough to get to see the film yesterday at a press screening in london and all my doubts were blown away literally in the first few minutes i am not going to give plot lines away as some reviewers have done nor am i going to tell you the catch phrases although there is really only one but i will try to tell you what they have managed to achieve with this film leaving the cinema on monday night i could only imagine writing 'oh my god it's brilliant its amazing its the best thing they have ever done better than the first second and specials all rolled into one ' of course i owe my visitors a much better explanation than that so why is it brilliant this is a film for everyone the casual fan the obsessive fan the occasional fan and even for someone who is sat in the wrong cinema you don't have to have watched the series to enjoy this film it works on so many levels br br this film reminded me why i am a league of gentlemen fan you can tell that filming was a true labour of love too the attention to detail is incredible the sets for the tv show were always detailed but i am going to have to watch the film again just to look at the background the story moves at a swift pace the action carrying us from royston vasey to the real world where we meet the 'creators' who are of course the league themselves along the way we manage to bump into favourite characters from the show but always within the central story unlike the tv sketch show br br i was glad that the film was dark in places a little scary and a little strange only fitting for the league of gentlemen the gents also managed to get their revenge on the bbc censors not as much slipping in the word as screaming it from the roof tops some may think the gents portrayal of themselves a little indulgent but that's the joke and with that comes my only worry the in jokes i mention below may puzzle some viewers and they might come over a little too clever but i shouldn't worry there is always a poo joke waiting just around the corner and speaking of jokes they come thick and fast and in a mixture of clever references wig jokes bum jokes visual jokes and cock gags i haven't laughed out loud in a cinema since well i can't remember the fans that have been the league since the beginning are rewarded with loads of 'in' jokes some that work on two levels a mainstream audience may laugh at a reference to a compact disc for one reason whilst fans of the local show will laugh for another reason altogether the cameos are genius peter kay and simon pegg form the strangest double act you have ever seen simon getting one of the films biggest laughs just by making a noise i was a little worried about the aspect of the film when i first heard about it but as a story within a story i was just getting into it when but that would be telling all i need to say is that it fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the film i am not a professional reviewer of films so i am finding it difficult to put into words how much i enjoyed this film but for now i will just say that if the supposed benchmark for british comedy films in recent years was the excellent 'shaun of the dead' then i am sorry but a new benchmark has just been set by the inventive hilarious and sometimes a little scary the league of gentlemen's apocalypse br br jason kenny 2005
<START> shahrukh khan and yash chopra films have never disappointed dilwale le jayenge is a romantic classic dil to pagal hai was fresh and perfect to watch mohabbatein remains as one of my favorite movies ever and veer zaara was magical darr though not the best is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned movies but definitely worth a watch and srk who blew me away with an excellent performance in repeats a villain act and this time he gets an experienced juhi chawla and sunny deol to support him br br before i comment on the acting it is not just the acting but the wonderful script that makes it worth a watch it is the writing that compliments the great acting the story is gripping but the characterization is what stands out the comedy track goes along well but the movie has the tendency of shifting at romance too much the viewer is bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of yawns but the movie is still good br br shahrukh khan is brilliant in his author backed role shahrukh khan once again is sympathetic and cruel you are bound to cry at the end juhi chawla is decent her screams are bound to become annoying after a while but in facial expression she is excellent but her ending scene she is brilliant though she was overshadowed by srk she has an author backed role that makes her very likable sunny deol is adequate his character was very likable but too perfect and it gets boring after a while he does a good job though anupam kher is really funny but his role felt a little out of place azmi supports well br br the songs are enjoyable and come at the right time jadoo teri magic at your sight is my favorite song and presentation is very 90's film like tu mere you are in front of me and hai written here are nice love songs band kar lo close the door is a decent love song also the instrumental song is danced to perfection as well as the naughty wedding song button the movie may not be perfect but it is well worth your time especially if your favorite actor is in it
