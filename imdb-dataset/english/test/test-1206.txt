<START> after seeing this routine by john leguizamo i finally realize why he is such a talent i enjoy great stage work and this is stage work at its best i cannot label it as a stand up routine because leguizamo is so intense when playing the different characters the only time he breaks character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part in which he does so coolly that you cannot help but appreciate his talents i wasn't really sure how i felt about him as an actor but freak solidified my appreciation of him for those out there that have not had the opportunity to see this show i feel for you definitely check it out it is one of the nest routines i have ever seen ranks with eddie murphy bill cosby and chris rock four stars and more
<START> this movie is based on the series street fighter alpha or zero it is placed in an other setting than streetfighter the animated movie this movie is all about ryu who is accompanied by ken and chun li i recognized rose and birdie there weren't any other characters used from the video game that i could discover the fighting scenes were ok but nothing really spectacular and there were not many of them to me this is odd isn't streetfighter about fighting streetfighter the animated movie 1994 is far superior to this movie it tries to be more than it really is the use of the power and other supernatural have nothing to do with skills the characters have in the video game and in this case that is a bad thing the story is so boring that you don't really care what is happening the action is toned down considerably why and what happened to the other characters from the video game surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story the main attraction of the video game are the characters with their own special skills in this movie it is all about ryu that is why this anime fails
<START> this is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days br br melanie griffith took off her shirt and in her pre enhancement surgery days she really should have stayed dressed br br jeff daniels was completely wasted but fortunately for him and for us he has gone on to much better things since this this this well heck piece of garbage br br strangely all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things including director jonathan demme his work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration i mean anything not worth doing is not worth doing well but he did it well anyway br br still there was one bright shining aspect ray liotta who is named way down the credit list just absolutely stole everything liotta was magnificently mesmerizing hypnotic enthralling br br i saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new in a friend's private theater for some strange reason my friend loved it i sort of think it's because melanie griffith took off her shirt and really honest she shouldn't have though he tried to claim it was other more artistic reasons br br anyway i thought even then after his first scene that ray liotta would become a major star or at least a major highly respected actor br br despite the aspects of the script the sheer ugliness of the whole story liotta made it almost worth watching in fact it is worth seeing once just to see how far ray liotta has come i mean for one thing his name is now usually listed at or near the top br br even then even in a pile of garbage ray liotta shone like a diamond br br just if you do see this trash be prepared to hold your nose every major character is either amoral or immoral terrible movie terrible movie idea br br added comment too many people answer was this comment helpful with a no because they disagree with the expressed opinion maybe imdb should ask that question instead do you agree with these opinions
<START> ok if you are looking for a fun lesbian romp this is not the movie if you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters in the vane of 'cruel intentions' or 'wild things' this is not the movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian movie this is not the movie br br however if you are looking to wast an hour of your life this is your movie it is badly written badly directed badly scored badly filmed it had bad special effects i mean really bad special effects i think that you can actually generate the same special effects in imovie lol br br it really is a pretty bad movie br br the actors were classic starlet beauties however look more like porn stars it is shot like a soft core porn however you never get the money shot and the actors all look bored out of their brains the 'girl on girl' scenes which suck btw were so lame that there hardly worth mentioning go watch the 'almost sex scenes' on youtube cos that's the only reason you would want to watch this movie and even there not worth it br br a wast of money and time don't even pick it up go watch 'cruel intentions 2' instead same movie without the bad special effects bad storyline bad writing bad dialog and bad acting actually i might go watch it now just to purge my mind
<START> one of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early and fortunately this is one of the better ones yes it has a cheesy plot but i was pleasantly surprised at this film because i thought it was really good and really entertaining although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob br br first of all we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous but when the teens arrive it doesn't seem very dangerous at all well according to me anyway it's a shame that we don't get movies like this any longer and if we do it's usually some boring terrible film br br this movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore because the gore factor is really low in this movie which i wasn't pleased with but other than that it's still a great movie br br all in all you'll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer it's totally not what you'd expect
<START> why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side kermit poses this relatively simple double near the beginning of the muppet movie while singing his signature song the rainbow connection as time goes by the question and the movie only gain profundity br br i'm going to forgo the review of this movie as a children's comedy but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing year br br as the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me i hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyone's life because we all dream and that is what this movie is about it's not just a bunch of puppets it's a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams which is a good lesson for everyone br br and while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good they're not a fair judge of the movie only the rainbow connection and the powerful emotions it will realize and it all fits in rainbow connection is the muppet movie and vice versa it's existentialism meets children's entertainment there's no simpler way to describe it
<START> this piece of garbage belongs in the basement of some moldy old mansion where it will never see the light of day again the only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission i was only amused when the ending credits started rolling and i was free to vacate the auditorium what an unmitigated bore a complete waste of 1 and a half hours when i die i pray i can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who penned this gibberish
<START> when one of the stars of a movie is named sticky you should know enough to stay away stay away house 2 is just more of the same this time with zombies overrunning a college campus man how that must have saved on money as usual the zombies are given no direction so speak of and provided very little makeup or costuming they look like the zombies in one of those endless italian zombie cheapies from years ago which is to say they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love from george romero and dan zombie flicks the folks battling the zombies are all who get to shoot guns and do little else some who have written here feel the sequel is slightly more focused than the original all i have to say is i'm glad the sequel's director did away with the 360 degree pan shots that helped to ruin the first movie house 2 is still just more of the same which means a lot of nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes there is one set piece involving soldiers with a zombie football team that might at least have been funny it's not
<START> ah i loved the book series and eagerly devoured each one in middle school and when i heard that there was a television adaptation i was very excited br br boy what a let down the final product was i think for me this was the moment when nickelodeon stopped being about cool programming and more generic br br so what was wrong with the series let me count the ways 1 the characters were horrifically miscast in the books the were somewhere between 12 14 the television cast were at least 18 i remember being horrified when i first saw the cast photos br br 2 horrific acting bad writing i dunno which was to blame so i'm lumping into the lumpy mass that it was perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hampered the humor that is at least cute coming out of a 13 year old because marco not funny in fact i don't remember a single comical moment from the group and there were a few the actors were certainly not helped by the writing which was bland at its best and head pathetic at its worst br br 3 my lord they were stingy with the budget the final result of the alone should have convinced to pull the plug their heads had that clearly showed which was the helmet br br 4 back to the cast rachel by far was the biggest let down far from being the warrior woman in the books the best equivalent in the tv series was scarecrow also i know cassie was an idealist but there is a difference between idealist and idiot br br 5 one of the worst opening titles ever did the music have to be that obvious 6 answering question 6 yes because everything else was dumbed down so why shouldn't the expectedly less intelligent viewers receive a thick as a brick song from a lame rap rock rip off or whatever the hell that was br br since then there have been bigger let downs iraq 2004 but in case i haven't made myself clear this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based from
<START> bay area residents probably remember paul from the diamond center an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s i mention him only because there is an actor in death machines who looks just like him playing the owner of an italian restaurant he appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a dragon lady mari who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film who controls the local syndicate our hero let's call him not paul from the diamond center plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of the simpsons' luigi you da spaghetti and seems unimpressed when one of his patrons complains about the food no there's no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce there's a red buddha in the pasta the calling card of the murderous crime boss who sends a statuette to each of her prospective victims death machines is bad by any measure and pretty boring which is an even worse crime
<START> i was into the movie right away i've seen the other coen movies with the exception of raising arizona and i've noticed that each of their movies has a color fargo is gray white lebowski is bright orange and this movie is a pleasant yellow br br the bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away soon the look is accompanied by the great great music it's the old folk sound the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life enjoyed by everyone chain gangs church choirs and even prison escapees br br now about the prison escapees i don't know what crime their characters could have possibly committed as they are a very very friendly group of guys clooney is fantastic completely nailing his role br br go see this as soon as possible i believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level for some reason the theater i was in was full of old ladies and old men and they loved it br br you'll love it too i promise i was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away
<START> please re watch all 3 series and do not go see this movie the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out tv episode into the most painful 2hrs of my life truly an awful film tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins micky has 1 line and her just reels out the same tired old puns also mr briss's accent just changes about 5 times in the film tons of badly acted extras and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god awful piece of crap batman and robin all is forgiven
<START> i saw it on video predictable horrid acting film flubs what more can be said this movie sucks the actors are annoying to say the least this was suppose to be a comedy but there was only one funny moment other than that is was painful to watch for me br br 1 out of 10 pass
<START> i saw this film when it first came out and have never forgotten it my uncle antoine is much much greater than the sum of it's parts the movie loosely is about a pre adolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in canada there are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building has a leisurely pace but have patience the reward is coming i believe the film was sub titled and as with all non english speaking movies i've seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors with the additional necessity of lip synching lines that don't quite fit the english speaking is a travesty for example while the sub titled version sings my uncle antoine is well worth the time to find and watch it in french
<START> escape from hell is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is crass exploitation the direction and writing are both sloppy for example the camera work during the fight between and wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening also if the alcoholic but kind hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape the fake plague plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it i would have given this film a 4 out of 10 the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and christina lai has an amazingly beautiful face and body but a particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 more points of course some sickos will take that as a recommendation after all one thing even more disturbing than this film is that some people actually gave it positive reviews
