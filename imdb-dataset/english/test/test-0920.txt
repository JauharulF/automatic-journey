<START> this is a very noir kind of episode it begins with jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend the recently divorced karen mills pat daughter in law of john huston who knew a few things about noir film and her daughter when they arrive karen goes in the house while jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room he then discovers karen has disappeared without a trace of course he calls dennis and when the police arrive they see no sign of karen but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes so of course that makes jim an immediate suspect br br this is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by rocky asking jim to go over the story once again rocky suggests that by jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn't think was important at the time but now might lead to a clue as to what happened it's a really well written scene and completes the transition of the rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent it also goes a long way to show that rocky isn't just some clueless old man either as he says you come to me because i'm your father and i'm smarter than you this is one of those times where we see where jim got his smarts br br this episode also features an appearance by hottie lara parker who played angelique in the dark shadows series and went on to play laura banner bruce's wife in the incredible hulk series a few years later she looks terrific here br br this episode also marks the first mention of the minette crime family a name that would keep popping up on the rockford files almost whenever they needed a mob family this time its vincent minette who rockford helps apprehend br br lt diehl tom atkins makes his first appearance on the series and dennis is quietly from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police sargent i guess they figured it would be better to have dennis less powerful and add some conflict between jim and the police frankly they were right though i prefer the later lt chapman to lt diehl br br not a lot of the typical rockford humor in this episode but a good mystery with a lot of heart
<START> will spanner david byrnes the fifth actor to play the role in the series stumbles onto another bizarre case this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches warlocks demons he's at the hospital to check on his friend's son who got hurt in a hit and run when they wheel a girl who's been attacked by a vamp in he brings in lutz to help out with the case which revolves around a clandestine vampire organization trying to get a business to go through to let them legally own all the blood banks in the world or some such nonsense br br the plot of this movie pretty much takes a backseat to the nudity simulated sex scenes as is to be expected from this series i guess so complaining about the lack of good acting or compelling plot line or even convincing characters i suspect would fall on deaf ears if you're watching this film you don't care about such 'frivolities' and just want some 'action' sadly on that front the film fails as well all the woman are attractive enough but the way the scenes are filmed are just atrocious making this more or less an exercise in futility in every conceivable way br br eye candy both kimberly blair april show everything shows full frontal aline mai lis holmes only shows their breasts br br my grade d
<START> this might quite possibly be the worst movie i have ever seen i knew it was a b movie before watching it it was actually the reason for watching it but i'd never thought it could be this bad the title promises dracula in space and does deliver however the story makes no real use of the fact that casper van character is a descendant of van helsing and watch out for the ending of the movie it comes at you fast i've never seen an ending scream out and now we're over budget in a clearer fashion their resolution of the movie was rather comic though the story had so obviously painted itself into a corner if you feel you have to see it watch it with a friend who shares your love of b movies if i hadn't i wouldn't have made it to the end
<START> i'm surprised over the number of folks that have rated this entry as their favorite chan didn't they ever see at the opera or at treasure island the latter ironically written by john larkin who dropped the ball here this plot is a train wreck and overloaded with pointless characters first viewers are required to recall the sordid details of steve played by venerable thug and huac marc lawrence murder spree let's not forget he escaped a capital murder rap at the courthouse with a lone policeman on his tail there's also a victim that was fished out of a river 11 years earlier that no one ever seems concerned about then there's the suspension of disbelief required when all the characters are seemingly trapped in the wax museum although inspector manages to wield his fat wet rear end inside through a window why is joan valerie as cream's assistant in this movie she can't even handle pliers properly i realize chan suffers the same boo boo but yeesh he's 66 years old here and has less than 10 lines and her character's motivation is too weak to ever be adequately excuse me when i'm on a rant i write like ricky ricardo the mary bolton marguerite chapman character is written to as a eager wide eyed moron apparently existing only for the vapid romantic interest of lawyer tom agnew played by the ferret faced ted osborne why is willie fern a character why couldn't henchman pulled the switch at 8 20 not a spoiler okay one wonders how with the iq of lint he manages to dress himself or why he hadn't stepped in front of a bus years ago toler himself is given a little more acting rope than usual a plus and the real kudos go to set designer thomas little and cinematographer virgil miller who created some genuinely spooky atmosphere but this entry has less logic than a ritz brothers film i'm still boggled by how a toothpick can be used as a blow gun
<START> the best bit when the dull mobster nicholas turturro calls out to the runaway matthew modine shane come back shane and when the older wise guy asks him what are you doing he replays simply enjoying my time actually like me at the moment br br the most creepy part i've been wondering all the time of watching where did i see that girl before where where till i found out while the closing credits ohh my god she's elizabeth berkley from the fiasco but i just couldn't recognize her with her clothes on to tell you the truth i felt a brief tremor she's really cute and nice but maybe hollywood had no mercy at all br br the most sexy bit when berkley says do you mean the stuff which gives you a boner br br the most dull thing the retarded assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end moreover the mexican smuggler took 3 bullets at the same car and he's not dead either br br the most ugly thing all of those murdered people as well as the numerous f ward to a boring extent br br the most beautiful thing the crazy clever script with all the funny characters and the tumultuous situations the acting looked sweet also especially from paul rodriguez who stole the show for as he had the best dialogue also br br the most disappointing thing although the direction didn't mess about the story's wittiness at all but in the same time it didn't give it a unique touch a matchless signature some kind of insane hilarity like the one in the story itself however maybe the low production wronged it well and of course the easy tasteless music which could be like that because of cheap production too br br the most confusing part matthew modine is a talented guy but what did he do exactly to be out of hollywood's a list of stars what could possibly be the thing he made or didn't make to end up in light independent jest like the shipment br br the most absent scene where did jose the mexican smuggler go at last i thought that we'll see him again at the end smuggling once more as the surviving little criminal who in a brief gimmick like this could materialize the continuous disorder of such a world br br the most question i had after the end when we'll see the shipment 2 as i'm so eager to see that fine small comic burly atmosphere again br br these were my own answers if you interested in giving answers of your own for this questionnaire please e mail me
<START> if you're looking for a not so serious mob movie with a female as the lead you're in the right place pfieffer has acted much better than this you can see she has matured beyond this picture br br when i first picked this movie up i expected pfeiffer was poorly miscast however she plays her mob wife role to the hilt not a bad performance from baldwin either br br if you don't pay attention to the hair you might enjoy this movie but don't take it too seriously
<START> i caught this film late at night on hbo talk about wooden acting unbelievable plot et al very little going in its favor skip it
<START> do it yourself indie horror auteur todd sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickel'n'dime shot on video clunker that's basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible an evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rot faced zombies so they can feast on the living a bunch of bickering college kids a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious slade byron hamming it up to an outrageous degree two equally savage sleazeball hoodlums and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal that's it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative coherence plenty it more than compensates for with a pleasing plethora of gloriously gore disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off a fatal gunshot to a young gal's groin attempted necrophiliac rape evisceration and of course more repulsive eating than you can shake a pile of moist intestines at moreover we've also got rough grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between washed out color and grimy black and white ineptly staged fight scenes lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic no name cast jerry angell in particular cops the top crummy thespic for his laughably abysmal histrionics as slimy no count psycho criminal joe bob a grating head banging thrash metal soundtrack and a generic synthesizer score let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of flesh eating bacteria to use on the shambling undead hordes sure this flick is pure dreck but it has a certain endearingly abominable quality to it that in turn makes it a great deal of so awful it's awesome grade z fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fright fare
<START> i'm a huge fan of both emily watson breaking the waves and tom wilkinson normal and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid infinitely entitled worthless son of a rich lord are spot on and entertaining but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone the music was annoyingly movie of the week quality and the voice over jarring and totally unnecessary clearly the work of a first time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't sufficiently heed good advice too bad br br i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end and vice versa so there is some sort of character arc at least in terms of perception for example watson's character while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man began to grate on me near the end particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat with no asking of permission no apologies offered and i went from disliking control freak moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wife br br this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a love story or steel magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed was it the lord driving the car the lord's dog the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for florence nightingale incarnate etc was ok until he started over the top sobbing like a baby good god if you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands and so she drives her hard working well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach br br look everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was instead he acted like an abused dog his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him i'm not anti pc or anything it just didn't ring true even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face the ending for me was and not the director's intention i am certain depressing the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing i'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed is that asking too much br br my score 4 10
<START> not being a movie aficionado i am not familiar with the names of leading directors scriptwriters producers and the like but i can tell an outstanding movie when i see one br br the makers of this fine movie could well be now at the top of their fields or may well get there pretty soon i know that the actors are already there br br it takes talent closer to genius to show with such realism how a national tragedy like vietnam has impacted the everyday life of a typically average american family and make us see at close range why there are so many homeless vietnam veterans br br without getting into gratuitous scenes of gore and bloodshed it makes us understand why so many men had flashbacks of what they had been thru br br the dialog is particularly gripping and gives us an idea of what went on in so many families in the aftermath of vietnam br br i wish there were more good movies like this one not just about vietnam but about other social conditions as well
<START> what has rajiv rai done to himself once a hit director of films like tridev and is now making one bad film after another i was initially excited at the thought of rajiv rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out as a rajiv rai fan i thought i should at least give it a go but i left after an hour one reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of bashing in the film this was not in previous venture br br a lot of directors have tried bashing but i did not expect it from rajiv rai another letdown was the music rajiv have always had good music until now there is only one good song and that is tere the performances are not upto scratch not even from rai loyalist naseer shah avoidable fare from once my favourite director
<START> the ma pa kettle characters were highly popular and controversial the films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula one obvious reference is 'the beverly hillbillies ' where the new home was bought with oil money not having been won in a contest you could even say the 1980s sitcom borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series still i wonder if betty macdonald the washington based author who created these characters didn't do more harm than good her portrayal of hillbilly characters makes them the butt of many jokes in terms of their alleged sloppiness and laziness the real life family that macdonald based the upon successfully sued claiming they had been ridiculed and humiliated with these less than flattering references sure it's comedy and the situations bring us a great many laughs and fun moments and political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s but i think macdonald could've still written these characters more sensibly and universal international could've had its scriptwriters show them on screen with more dignity there's such a thing as good taste the more realistic moments are when the oldest son tom is ashamed of his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are for their part the have to realize that they don't exactly fit into a modern world that's not a joke that's a sober truth
<START> to identify this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct simply because it will suck the life right out of you br br vampire effect is an insult to movie buffs everywhere the plot is almost non existent the make up is just plain awful and the acting is just not there br br i have to wonder if jackie chan owed someone a huge favor to be convinced to appear in this film br br my wife picked up the movie at the rental store because it had a picture of jackie chan on the front as though he was playing the lead and thought that a good jc flick would be fun to watch this movie was interesting to watch in the same way that you can't help staring at the car wreck when you drive by you realize very quickly the movie isn't going to get any better but you keep watching wonder just how bad it will get

<START> crossfire is one of those films from the forties that is crying for a remake if for no other reason than maybe it's time it should be done as originally written the story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man but anti semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days of post world war ii with the holocaust fresh in everyone's mind br br in the lee server biography of robert mitchum edward the director was interviewed and and bluntly said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at the time with the code firmly in place it could have been though because the character of robert ryan is such an equal opportunity hater of everything that deviates from his societal norms br br mitchum was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the ride robert young was cast as the washington dc police homicide captain who catches the case and while mitchum was second billed he knew from the beginning the film would belong to ryan but he was rko's new star by dint of his performances in the story of gi joe and till the end of time so he was there for box office insurance mitchum's part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case george cooper br br crossfire is not a whodunit even though we don't see the crime it becomes clear that montgomery is the one who kills sam levene the quintessential jewish salesperson and it becomes clear to young and mitchum that ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as it does to the audience it becomes just a question of getting the evidence br br ryan earned one of several academy award nominations the film garnered his best supporting actor category though he lost to edmund gwenn the film was ryan's breakthrough role similarly gloria grahame was nominated for a brief part as a party girl for best supporting actress but she lost to celeste holm for gentleman's agreement in fact crossfire ran up against gentleman's agreement and lost for best picture and best director for to elia kazan it's fifth nomination for best screenplay and crossfire came up short again with the winner being miracle on 34th street br br gloria grahame also had her own problems on the set which spilled over from her personal life she was having big trouble with her then husband stanley who was an abusive husband he was hanging around the set causing ed a lot of problems fortunately grahame's part was a small one in fact the whole film was shot in typical rko economy style in 20 days br br robert young has a particularly fine scene with william phipps a young kid from tennessee in mitchum and ryan's outfit who ryan constantly belittles young is most eloquent in speaking about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affected his family as irish catholics who came over in the potato famine years it was one of robert young's best moments on screen in his long career br br as fine a film as crossfire is it's time to be remade as a story about an anti gay hate crime especially with the real killing of barry from the last decade and the debate about gays in the military br br that's a film who's time has come and almost gone
