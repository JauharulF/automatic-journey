<START> before launching into whether this film is worth your time or not i should inform you i've never seen another adaptation of carmen so if you're looking for a review on how it ranks amongst others this might not be of much use to you br br the only time i've come across carmen was on the car stereo when driving through spain on a family holiday when i was a teenager i didn't pay much attention to it because i didn't like opera at the time and i didn't know any better the story has been around for 150 years or so do i feel i've missed out after seeing this movie yes mainly due to the plot but also because if all the actresses who played carmen looked like paz vega i would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my dvd collection br br directed by vicente who also co rewrote the story with joaquim the story is told through the eyes of the original author prosper mÃ©rimÃ©e a french writer making his way through 19th century spain he comes across josÃ© leonardo a delinquent soldier and one of many men who fall in love with carmen paz vega a sultry sexy gypsy woman who has the mouth of the devil the temper of a and who recklessly leads men to their doom the moment she meets josÃ© she is attracted by his stand behaviour but she hooks him reels him in and lets him go many a time until one day josÃ© is wanted for murder carmen persuades him to join her band of gypsy smugglers they seem to be settling she's fallen in love with him but she meets the charming the bullfighter can josÃ© hold his jealousy in check or does it destroy him br br it's a beautiful seductive story something that resembles almost a shakespearian or ovid plot with the portrayals of immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and transform us to do things out of character it's poetic fiery and above all slutty i was left hanging on i didn't know which way it was going to turn i always hoped that josÃ© might change dirty little ways i won't tell you if he succeeded or not br br the above synopsis is what i took away from the film but i was not impressed by the film itself it was only after i watched it that i dug a little deeper into the story and i realised how much of a missed opportunity had made of retelling classic it was a shallow slutty period drama blunder that saw paz vega spend a lot of the time partially or completely naked not that i'm complaining about this in particular br br first of all the acting was poor i was not impressed by as josÃ© i'm still unsure whether he was a weak actor or josÃ© was supposed to be a weak character i've not read the book he's supposed to be a man who with burning desire for carmen but he spends much of the time looking confused jealous and a bit dim paz vega was slightly better as carmen i was convinced by her hardened wicked character although i have seen more convincing performances by her in other films such as zapping and lucia y el sexo she seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman not that i've come across many andalusian gypsy women so in a way the role didn't really fit her the other actors in the film weren't great either they seemed to do everything half heartedly the story is passionate emotive Â they looked half arsed as if they couldn't wait to get out the tight 19th century costumes they were wearing br br however the costumes i was impressed with one of the redeeming factors of the film i like spanish culture i liked the soldiers' uniforms the top hats and the women's flamenco dresses they fitted the time well that's all i can really say about that sorry back to the criticism br br the script as stated above was co rewritten by vicente and joaquim and done so badly so much that it would leave mÃ©rimÃ©e turning in his grave it was boring it didn't make best use of intense passion for carmen or maybe that was just the acting there were cheesy lines piled upon one and other satan and devil connotations everywhere amongst the millions of swear words i know the spanish are partial for the odd swear word but the film was littered with in literally every line maybe it was realistic in 19th century poverty stricken seville but the story itself didn't need it br br the editing and camera work was dull and ordinary there was only one bit i actually liked and that was when the camera follows a fly close up in mid air which lands on face that was good but the rest boring br br to conclude it is sad to see such a great story go to waste with unconvincing acting and directing if you're a literature teacher by all means let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of the story however only the male half of the class will be paying any interest to the film thanks to paz vega otherwise stick to the opera version even though i hate musicals i give this film 4 just for the fact i love the storyline and paz vega
<START> hilarious i would have sworn ed wood wrote this terrible i loved every frame bad movie aficionado's this is your trophy i will watch it again words cannot explain how entertaining this movie is career must have dipped low but i really think he's heading in the leslie nielson direction he was perfect for this terrible just terrible you'll love it get some friends lots of beer and you'll have the time of your life it's an mst3000 party waiting to happen enjoy it is worth the rental you like the colombo type cop and the comic relief coroner the bad guy will have you on the floor laughing he's also in another pare movie komodo vs cobra and he's just as good there i don't know what the budget was but they'll get it back because this film is destined to be the best unintended comedy of the year
<START> rififi is a great film that is overlooked it's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job it's an over used story but this one is different from the others they round up the usual suspects for the job this film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on the actual heist scene is one of the best i have ever seen instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence around thirty minutes of silence this fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days of course things get out of hand and people die and it ends in a great ending that builds up in suspense br br so if you're looking for a great film noir that not a lot of people talk about this is a great pick up
<START> ok first off there may be a spoiler here since i don't know what constitutes giving out too much information my subject line says it all but surely people will want to know why it's so stupid br br first off this film follows a bunch of yuppies as they go to a sports game in chicago but wind up taking the wrong exit and winding up in the ghetto scary huh well first of all emilio is driving everyone in the world's most overblown rv tricked out with satellite dishes and crap like that on it so these guys are going to a sports game i forget which though likely the bulls or the white sox since they're near the oh so scary ghetto yet they can't even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put espn to shame yet they're smart enough to earn that would pay for the stuff but are such sports fans that they don't even know which exit to get off at on their way to the game they so love br br i gave up on the movie within a half hour after that but the reasons were plentiful they wind up in the ghetto yet their main danger to their existence is denis leary a white guy i'm no racist but come on in anything resembling reality and this film was trying to be an urban nightmare denis leary would not be trying to kill emilio estevez he'd be hitching a ride to get the f out of dodge himself br br this is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created although i'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world's cinema if mst3k were still on they surely would have devoted an episode to this one
<START> excuse me if i'm wrong but para un could be one of the most films in mexican movie history for a lot of reasons we can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect mexican middle class family breakfast a cup of surrealistic motifs with a little drop of scenarios a pound of phallus symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity more than todd happiness and the dogma movement films there s a lot of sordidness black humor repressed dreams teodoro's dream of fly incestual lack of control the relation between marcos and no sense parallel stories a discrete violence anachronisms and br br a little sign of hope spotlighted in the husband's home return and un mas used for leit motif marcos bruno bichir is a charming character i think in a way the king without a crown who don't expects for anything but broken noses maria rojo the lovable wife put out a lot of faces but the only thing that she worried is that her sons had breakfast s a loser in many ways and sensual in few moments but you will fall in love of her the soundtrack's drag too much woods feeds the lack of technical merits intentional of course out of focus shots close ups in introspective scenes dizzy pans and sudden edition cuts is something difficult to digest it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it it tastes bitter like a rotten orange juice and sour like expired milk but you want to enjoy it so i recommend to get some before the show because you won't get hungry after all
<START> every once in a while you stumble across a movie that takes you by surprise and this is one of them on the surprise scale this would rate as sharing a hot tub with jessica alba whilst a band consisting of elvis jimi hendrix john lennon phil and keith moon play you music for the night the reason why this film will surprise you is that for the meagre budget they had Â£8 000 and that this was done by a bunch of mates who just wanted to try it out they have produced something very slick and looks easily 100 times more than its budget br br the plot is simple a crew of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner through space come under attack and are forced to crash land on a nearby desolate planet after some checks not only does the planet not exist according to star charts but they are not alone as it seems and something very unfriendly begins to pick them of one by one it sounds like very standard sci fi fare mixing elements of aliens predator and pitch black but it takes all these and makes them into something that feels fresh and original br br the location shooting in this is fantastic utilising beach in to the maximum and you genuinely feel that you are one an alien world the seemingly never ending sand dunes and clever lighting effects give it a very bleak feel you truly think the crew are stranded on an alien world also the action sequences are superb the opening assault on the freighter a great showcase of what special effects can be achieved on a budget and the firefights as well as the stunning finale all showcase the inventiveness of the film br br as for the team of mercenaries the cast excels themselves for a low budget independent movie the casting here was done via local media outlets and they seem to have picked some possible stars for the future local body builder mike mitchell whilst not a natural actor slots into his role as the arnie esq leader of the mercenaries from the rest of the cast there are two stand out performances patrick wright as second in command and scott ironside as the rough and ready engineer vince both have some the best lines in the movie and scott injects a good bit of humour into the movie with his performance patrick gives a well rounded performance as the cool as ice second in command br br director mark can be very proud of what he has achieved and shows that scottish cinema need not all be and or and scottish films can be fresh inventive and most of all a lot of god damn fun this film is scottish with a north east flavour to the core and praise to the actors and directors for keeping the accents intact which adds to the charm of the piece although the budget limitations show from time to time the only fault i could find that is to be expected this film its cast and crew deserve all the success they get and then some more i for one wish mark and his crew every success and theirs is a career to keep a very close eye on br br rating 9 10 the first scottish sci fi is bold fresh and inventive a real triumph br br movie reviews news and opinion like no other plus the kick ass bi weekly pod casts br br www co uk br br contact co uk
<START> a sign of what to expect in this film came when i spotted that this was the first and probably the last film to have in its credits a vomit technician br br in what is a couple of hours of silly gags hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humour br br this film was just what you'd expect from the bottom boys and it is great to see them back in their best form after mayall's life threatening accident br br richie and eddie are too similar to their bottom characters if we can have any criticism at all and does a surprisingly good job in directing the film also br br this film has already spawned the predictable comparisons to fawlty towers that just aren't there and the guest house paradiso itself is hardly br br watch out for some excellently crafted dialogue amongst all the violence and mayhem br br if you don't like bottom you'll probably hate this but i loved it
<START> i didn't realize just how much of this episode was taken from the enemy below until i finally saw the movie it has since become my fave war flick there were a couple of elements lifted from run silent run deep as well nothing wrong with stealing ideas as long as you do something cool with them and boy did roddenberry and company do something cool with this one br br the story begins when the romulans violate a 100 year old treaty and by crossing the neutral zone and destroying a series of federation outposts along the zone ostensibly to test their superior weaponry and invisibility screen and subsequent shift in the balance of power between the romulans and the federation in their view as a prelude to an all out invasion kirk has to decide whether it's worth risking war to try and stop the ship or if in fact the greater risk lies in letting the invaders go after they destroyed 4 military outposts kirk wisely chooses the latter br br this is our first look at an enemy of the federation the romulans a warlike yet in their own way honorable race who are distant relatives to the vulcans however unlike their peaceful cousins the romulans did not renounce their emotions and violent and ways even as they advanced technologically br br none of this matters to mr stiles the ship's navigator and this episode's chief antagonist on board the enterprise the commander has his own problems with a gung ho junior officer all that matters to him is he hates romulans and spock looks like one until the end when spock saves his life naturally this contrasts sharply with captain kirk and the commander neither of whom has any personal ill will towards the other at all both men are simply doing their duty in fact there's a mutual respect this is the first trek episode to deal directly with prejudice and it does so deftly as opposed to season 3's not so subtle let that be your last battlefield br br like the enemy below we have a classic chess match between two ship commanders who are actually very much alike you see right away that both of these captains are good very good if you were going into battle you'd want either of these man as your leader both are honorable and decent men who are duty bound yet even though the commander is bound by duty to his home world he still finds himself wishing for destruction before he can make it home rather than start another interstellar war yet he still does everything he can to make it home just as kirk does everything he can to stop him br br this is in my opinion one of trek's 5 best it has everything plenty of action suspense great dialogue fine acting i still maintain the commander was mark best trek role and it manages to make its social commentary without being overly preachy a pity roddenberry forgot about the last part when he did tng br br watch this episode then watch the enemy below
<START> is not a bad movie but the acting and the screenplay can be better i like this movie because i have a life that is in good part like the one in the movie is hard for a lost generation to get a life in romania and 90 percent of us choose something else and that something else includes dealing with people with bad habits if you understand me but that comes with the territory this movie represent me and i like it i have a rage in me that i barley talk with people i live in a messed up society and i can't fit in and i don't want to and that's the story of movie also if you r like me you can understand the true movie if not you will find it easy and cheap
<START> this movie is certainly well constructed beginning and ending in the dark with focus on lili smith schmidt julie andrews initially the singing 'angel' later the notorious spy br br it's beautiful i saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently while it was dismissed by critics in the 70's as overblown 'cinema and lacking in structure among others time has proven them wrong blake edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality br br the film soars and swirls aerial photography julie andrews in motion and captivates one must just buy into the premise that julie andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong overlooking the tepid chemistry between julie andrews and rock hudson one must believe that these are lovers who in all innocence fall for each other and in the end love is far more important than winning wars and so is maintaining innocence br br there is a lot of understated acting and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comedies br br there are wonderful comedic elements foreshadowing the french goons in victor victoria interesting diplomatic asides reminding me of the seed seen about 18 years ago and a general sense of good will br br suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away julie andrews' belting out of war songs and the haunting away the dark' are reason enough to turn the tv on just for the soundtrack and the striptease number like the number in star works br br this film has like a good champagne aged well paramount should bring it to dvd as soon as possible the same applies to transferring the laser disk of star to dvd these are both interesting pieces of julie andrews' meticulous and then underrated works
<START> my wife and i saw every episode in this series and loved it however the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show it ended with a typical end the season cliff hanger leaving it's fans feeling cheated a waste of great writing and acting
<START> this is the sequel to octopus br br pff ok a lot of stock footage but pretty good i'm surprised that they actually had a giant robot octopus that actually didn't look that bad i was actually quite surprised by that br br the movie overall was just ok fun it never explained how the octopus got so big and isn't linked it anyway to the first but it was still fun br br the ending me and my friend laughed at basically after blowing the octopus up once the two main characters launch a bomb and five explosions most stock footage appear on screen we joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a 'five missiles in one' toy believe me it has to be seen to believe overall just stupid fun worth giving a chance buying if it's cheap
<START> get smart should be titled get stupid there is not one funny line or gag in the entire film this film is so bad it makes the austin powers films look shakespearean a few more films like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye as for anne hathaway what is she doing in this film she's a good actress but is just plain terrible br br the writing is pathetically lame there is not one funny clever or witty line there is not one good sight gag br br the directing is terrible comedy relies on timing someone should tell the director that every line that is supposed to be funny and isn't is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing i've ever seen br br 0 stars
<START> reports of this film's brilliance appear to have been greatly exaggerated and unless the other reviewers were watching a different movie i fail to see how anyone can find this film anything other than dull unscary overlong and at times unbearably irritating i'm not some schlocky horror fanatic i love j horrors and euro horrors over american horrors any day but i feel the need to warn any potential viewers about this film before they invest two hours of their life in it br br it could have been so great a reporter is investigating a series of bizarre deaths and occurrences which seem ostensibly but a series of unnerving tropes appears to connect them dead pigeons thudding noises the presence of strangely tied knots our reporter goes from person to person interviewing them filming them and then passing on three important characters are among this jumble of people a young shy psychic girl an immensely irritating insane psychic man and a crazy old woman and her boy whose importance is not revealed until later on br br the problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting which makes its two hour running time unforgivable it's also not even remotely scary or creepy supposedly scary scenes like shots of ghoulish faces are done incredibly poorly shown twice or worse we are told when they are about to happen other techniques such as telling us that a family just interviewed died five days later simply don't make me care let alone mildly creeped br br the film does pick up a bit towards the end as our reporter cameraman psychic and cursed woman go to a village in order to the curse which is linking all these deaths however by that time i was in a state of catatonic boredom and couldn't care less so all the fairly creepy camera work and shocks were wasted on me the final tape is quite good but once again i'd given up caring and just wanted this film to end br br boring and dull not scary and not creepy i would advise you keep away from it has promising moments but this is a film that was poorly made and not worth your time
<START> i simply cannot believe the folks that made and performed in this movie really took it seriously the skits on snl look more real everything was laughably fake the goofy gunfights the ridiculous fist fights the dialogue the sappy background music and even bo's blind eye had it been billed as a comedy it still would have made more sense but still would be bad i can see this as entertainment only if you get a room full of stoned college kids watching it like it were rocky horror picture show imagine some of the stuff you saw on blazing saddles like knocking the horse down or the old lady stomach punched now imagine the producer wants you to take those scenes seriously and you get the of this disaster
