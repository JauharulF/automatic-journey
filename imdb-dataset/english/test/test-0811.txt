<START> first off i'am a horror fan but this tobe hooper production come on the man from the original texas chainsaw and poltergeist was below standards even for a fan the acting was not bad at all some characters were unbelievable but the leading ladies were ok the story was something we've seen a hundred times already without any surprising twist or whatever never exciting or intense and do not count on any special effects besides blood splashing up the scary zombie kids are white paled faces with dark eyes and that is it that might have worked in the early 70's but not now director j s cardone didn't do a good job in keeping the suspense half way thru there is a risk you will fall asleep my vote is based primarily on the leading acting but this could have easily have been called children of the corn 8 from the corn fields to the mines enough said
<START> i knew this would be one of the worst movies i could have imagined but in just 20 short minutes it actually exceeded my low by being possibly the worst movie i have ever seen br br i have already wasted too much time typing about it trust me it sucks
<START> oh boy oh boy on the cover of worn out vhs has a picture of sandra bullock and her name written on top i think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties was because of sandra bullock's name bullock's fans don't have to disappoint sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting rest of the movieÂ it's fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it's bad but after that it's going worse much worse directing is awful acting is awful script is awful dialog is awful action is awful music is quite good actually typical score for eighties action movies this movie is so bad that it goes close to anything andy sidaris has ever produced it's so bad that there isn't proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie but still there was sandra bullock and super cool sarcasm jake who tried to be marlon brando br br i think they can now bring the film out on dvd it could be cool and they should write on the cover academy award winner sandra bullock in br br 1 out of 10
<START> the second in director cohen's trilogy of second world war comedies the others being death do us and adolf hitler my part in his is a film version of the bbc's long running and much loved situation comedy like most transfers of television shows this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high ranking army officer floats down a river is a memorable surreal moment br br the joy of this movie is it's representation of a past that probably never existed and an england which is defined by picturesque countryside and the chance it offers to see veteran scene stealers such as john le mesurier given their biggest film roles arthur lowe is superb as captain a who when the chips are down displays great courage and saves the day the climax is probably the character's greatest moment br br episodes of the television series are of course funnier but as an introduction to a british legend you cannot find anything better
<START> minor spoilers br br in chicago grace beasley kathy bates is a housewife having a twenty five years marriage with the lawyer max beasley dan aykroyd and a hysterical and psychotic dwarf daughter in law meredith eaton grace worships the singer victor fox jonathan price who will present a tv show in chicago and will give five spots on the first row in a tv promotion kate calls the show and wins a ticket when max simultaneously asks for the divorce claiming that their lives are too monotonous grace becomes depressed and when she goes to the show the audience is informed that a chicago serial killer who uses a crossbow killed victor fox with a broken heart she decides to fly to england to victor fox's funeral there she realizes that he was gay and becomes friend of his former mate dirk simpson rupert everett they fly back to chicago trying to find the killer this movie is a delightful original and weird dramatic comedy having bizarre characters it has a huge potential to be a cult movie with the presences of julie andrews and barry manilow themselves and a joke with nicolas roeg's masterpiece 'don't look now' when wears a red raincoat in chicago's underground part of the city the beginning of the movie with jonathan price singing is wonderful i have repeated it four consecutive times the cast has a magnificent performance highlighting kathy bates jonathan price rupert everett and the unknown meredith eaton indeed this movie is an excellent entertainment my vote is eight br br title brazil a 'love to the proof'
<START> 1959 was a landmark in the world of film several great directors of the classic era were releasing career capping classics that ranked among their best just a look at the titles is instructive hitchcock's north by northwest billy wilder's some like it hot howard hawks' rio bravo douglas sirk's imitation of life add a couple from the previous year orson welles' touch of evil hitch's vertigo and nick ray's wind across the everglades and you've got a pretty good summing up of what was possible within the classic hollywood style br br at the same time two films appeared that hinted at a whole new way of making films one was jean luc godard's breathless the other was john cassavetes shadows the two films had certain things in common largely improvised acting by non stars handheld cameras low budgets and a certain youthful jazzy swagger in certain ways though they couldn't be farther apart godard was still a believer in the director as arbiter of style he knew more about film than most hollywood producers and breathless was filled with the iconography of the classic crime film cassavetes on the other hand was an actor and a refugee from new york's underground theater scene his first film shows him little impressed with the cinema and a big believer in actors godard's film constantly references it's own artifice whereas shadows aims for a certain kind of naturalism br br it doesn't reach it mainly because naturalism is a myth particularly in cinema but it feels powerful kinetic but lilting like the cool jazz on the score certainly the main inspiration for the filmmaking style on display here it ultimately doesn't hold together mainly because cassavetes' actors here are amateurish beatniks where cassavetes style requires strong imaginative actors his later work with gena rowlands ben gazarra and peter falk blows this out of the water due to the director's technical inexperience some bits of dialogue had to be redubbed later which defeats the freshness of the improvisation still it's fascinating to watch both for the great moments like the scene where leila goldoni talks about her dissapointment with losing her virginity and to watch a groundbreaking artist finding his way
<START> this is possibly the worst thing i've ever seen on television first i'm pretty sure it takes itself entirely seriously and i tend to be pretty good at recognizing satire second it displays aristotelian levels of chauvinism in one of the ads for it one of the describes women in terms of quality third every contestant i've seen on it six i think was a dim witted meathead of the variety likely to possess a facebook with boning u or women entered under here for to paraphrase roger ebert this doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel nor deserve mention in the same sentence as barrels the closest thing to a redeeming feature i've experienced with regards to key to the vip was having a female friend reassure me that the male cast were indeed the opposite of attractive in both physical and mental terms
<START> a group of young travelers that just ran out of gas go into a weird wax museum called lost oasis owned by a strange man named chuck as the dummies are controlled by some mysterious force and a madman with special powers wants them dead br br one of the most under appreciated horror movies of the late 70's this charles band producer of re animator production has became one of the scariest and most unique low budget horror productions of it's day combining some psychological themes along without having to result some gore like the usual slasher movie the movie keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats with tension and some scares the movie has became a cult diamond in the rough for the genre since then and this is well worth watching br br also recommended pin the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 the hills have eyes 1977 maniac 1980 magic 1978 dolls may just before dawn house of 1000 corpses the devil's rejects sleepaway camp mother's day a nightmare on elm street friday the 13th halloween 1 2 puppet master house of wax 1953 and 2005 jeepers creepers high tension evil dead ii from dusk till dawn waxwork nothing but trouble and psycho 1960
<START> this film is a nightmare the sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same i got when i finished watching this movie it ended what a relief i felt pain watching this movie so bad it was it's a b series low cost movie that's for sure but i think it not an excuse to be so bad i've watched brilliant low cost movies with nice plots nice production nice acting and most of all some substance this one got nothing of it the plot is hilarious it almost seems like an american guide about how to transform ancient chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie with some kids playing with the occult Â i don't know if the chinese tale present in this movie is real or not but if it is the damage is even worse the production is just horrible a plain zero what special effects are those there's no suspense the supposed tension scenes are a complete failure the acting is not better and what about the dialogs oh my god a movie which has for several times dialogs just like i will pass there later ok is that alright Â ok alright ok Â ok alright bye then Â i'm sure it doesn't deserve more than a 1 10 score br br too bad to be true
<START> it seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for the sopranos as its main character martin blank john cusack is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all everything finally comes to a head at his 10 year high school reunion the problem was that by the time blank got to the reunion i had stopped caring frankly i found this movie a drag from start to finish br br it had potential there was a reasonably good cast headed by cusack and dan aykroyd playing grocer his arch rival in the hit man business along with minnie driver as debi high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night and a limited role for alan arkin as dr psychologist that fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together though the drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour what i thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was grocer's proposal for a hit man's union but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke the idea never really got developed as for the romance one wondered why debi would even think of letting this guy back into her life br br there were a handful of chuckles but nothing really caught me and held me and i spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click it never did not for me at least 2 10
<START> evan almighty 2007 steve carell morgan freeman lauren graham johnny simmons graham phillips jimmy bennett john goodman wanda sykes john michael higgins jonah hill molly shannon ed helms cameo jon stewart as himself strained 'sequel' to bruce almighty with carell's jerk anchorman evan baxter leaving tv to begin his stint as a freshman congressional rep has his hands full when god freeman reprising his holy role jim carrey wisely avoided the demands he build an ark like noah and the hilarity ensues or should have the godforsaken sitcom y script by steve oedekerk joel cohen alec is absolutely lame and only carell's amiable persona transcends his vain evan into something resembling a human being the end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat reportedly costing 175 m for the cgi f x sykes steals the show as evan's sarcastic assistant unfunny dir tom shadyac
<START> ordinarily i love these stranger within thrillers some good examples are fatal attraction single white female and audition done well they can be a lot of fun and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares of course the opposite can be true done poorly they can be tedious and stupid the hand that rocks the cradle is one of the latter br br the claire annabella sciorra and michael matt mccoy are welcoming another member to their family but busy claire is persuaded by michael to hire a nanny one day a woman named peyton flanders rebecca shows up and because she seems perfect the hire her of course once she shows up their idyllic life is slowly unraveling br br this film suffers from a plethora of problems but the biggest one is the handling of the villain peyton is never believable part of this has to do with how she's written and how she's acted the things that she does that are supposed to put us on edge are so contrived that they're laughable de doesn't help much she portrays peyton as two different people while it's true she's supposed to be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies de performance creates a divide between the two facets of her character br br the other actors are good however annabella is terrific as the asthmatic claire sciorra is very natural in the role but unfortunately the script lets her down matt mccoy is almost invisible however julianne moore is delightful as claire's friend marlene moore is a firecracker but unfortunately she's only on screen for a total of five minutes br br curtis hanson is a good director but you wouldn't know it from watching this dud the film has a few decent shocks but it's poorly paced and the climax while generating some tension is actually kind of laughable that being said he's working with a script that at best could charitably be called pathetic br br trust me when it comes to stick with fran this one should have gone to the direct to video bin
<START> i would purchase this and thirty seconds over toyko today if available i also saw this movie after seeing large billboards of jack webb in his dress blues on the highway at the age of 12 always admired jack as a john wayne type and american all the way almost became a marine just because of this movie but served instead in the air force air force reserve and army reserve for 32 years have not seen this movie on tv at all and would love to own it on dvd at least if it was on tv i would copy it to vhs and use it until available on dvd i also have a large collection of wwii and korean war movies and always look for new releases on dvd
<START> one of the biggest french success of the year 2002 was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a french film it is not difficult to define the reasons of this success this movie made by one of the most interesting french film makers of these last years cÃ©dric presents students coming from all over europe and gathered all together under the same roof in barcelona these students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life either untidy either serious or with a sense of humor i guess that if the movie worked so well it is because a lot of students must have recognized themselves in the main characters' portraits and especially br br we follow the movie and so his experience abroad as an erasmus student through his eyes xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities his faults an intelligent making with quite a lot of ingenious ideas perfectly expresses his lost mind and his anxiety about the world and being an erasmus student on that subject the best examples can be found in two sequences the first one is when xavier asks a woman at university for the papers he has to send to prepare his dea when the same woman informs him about the different necessary procedures all the papers appear on the screen when she is naming them in the next sequence voice over confides to the spectator his vision of the modern world now where to find the second example well the scene where xavier has a thorough medical examination during which films his visions is widely sufficient to speak of itself br br moreover the director wasn't really interested by his main character's studies he left this point low key he rather put a lot of effort into private life of course in his love affair with anne sophie but also and especially in his relations with his fellow tenants it is a real friendship story that shows us with its moments of happiness but also its arguments and its tensions through adventure and at the end of his stay he will have been initiated into life which will make him more mature the message that the author wanted to transmit isn't difficult to guess you naively believe that you live in an untidy and complicated world you mustn't give up but search to get what you want even if it is difficult br br apart from this we could also fear that with the topic cÃ©dric wouldn't avoid a trap the clichÃ©s let's be frank about it they are included in the screenplay but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his movie then the screenplay contains convenient and predictable moments at the airport and before boarding we see xavier shedding a tear after he left his family but fortunately the shortcomings of the script stop here quite funny dialogs and cool young actors perfectly at ease in their roles make up the whole br br in spite of its weaknesses is to be taken for a success in the movie of young people besides the whole atmosphere it brings out lets us think that this movie is directed primarily to a young audience ultimately the end of the movie and its big success let us suggest that succumbed to a fashion that goes right for american cinema the elaboration of sequels and indeed the film maker currently works on a sequel entitled les let's hope that it will be as good as
<START> i saw this video at a friends house and it was the lamest thing i have seen ever i lost a lot of the little respect i had for nin very boring and the music is as equally interesting dont waste your time unless you are a hardcore nin fan
