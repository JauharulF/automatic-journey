<START> it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you don't have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tv set tip see it with some close friends
<START> i am an avid julie andrews fan and i just watched this for the first time on dvd the director's cut version i was very surprised that it was rated g how did they get bedroom scenes a seduction story line two strip tease acts and war shooting blood into a g rating weird i would rate it pg 13 br br other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it was a beautiful showcase of andrew's voice and talent the acting was great the storyline was a little weak leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue there were too many no talking just walking scenes for me i would have liked to see the the relationship between julie and rock blossom so that the intense love would be more believable
<START> this show was an amazing fresh innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today br br it's truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts this show probably wouldn't still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i can't believe it's still on the air
<START> my wife and i struggle to find movies like this that are clean and yet enjoyable for adults if you can't find a cinema that is playing it call your cinema and request it bravo five sisters productions for courage tenacity and creative endeavor
<START> starting on or around 1965 american movies took a turn for the shocking and the iconoclastic which was great for the times sort of the seeds that would pave the way for grittier daring dramas however because the very decade that gave birth to these films was so ruled by its own convictions most all of the films released at this period have dated cactus flower is no exception its very title suggests a sunny romantic comedy with occasional lapses into the risquÃ© this is not to say that it's a bad thing quite the contrary films about risquÃ© subject matter have to begin somewhere and america being a culture rooted in specific traditions themselves laced in deep hypocrisies shocks itself for the sake of it when seeing an indirect reflection of the mores of the time meanwhile european films address these same situations walk off looking like a million bucks and have a longer shelf life because what we consider scandalous they shrug off say next and move on br br toni simmons goldie hawn in her breakout role a young very sixties bright young thing is carrying on with a much older dentist named julian winston walter matthau who has commitment issues he marry her he's already married toni decides instead of wilting away she actually wants to meet his wife and set things straight into the picture comes his assistant stephanie dickinson a luminous ingrid bergman returning to american cinema after a twenty year absence a woman closer to his age who acts as if she and he had the perfect marriage and household there is a reason for this she has harbored quiet emotions for julian emotions he is unaware of even when he asks her to play his wife to ward toni off from wanting to step their relationship further and then he steps it up a notch when blissfully innocent actions veer the action off into the unexpected and he introduces harvey greenfield jack weston as stephanie's lover by the way harvey is also an older gent who is having an affair with a much younger woman eve bruce whom he also lies to in one very funny scene br br it's funny how the person whom we're looking for is the one who's always been there what could have been a thankless role for rick lenz who plays igor sullivan next door neighbor turns into the man who not only sees the true beauty in fellow outcast stephanie but the one who saves toni at the start from killing herself not the stuff of comedy suicide then again this is not your average comedy and needless to say is ingrid bergman's subtle poignant portrayal of a woman who's somehow missed her chances at love who's become prickly who due to a lie said to another she becomes the real person she was always meant to be i can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep role br br movies like these can be enjoyed at face value and seen as escapist fun a product of its times or be viewed for the deep symbolism that like its title it carries deep within it's a tricky film the same way hawn's and bergman's performance are equally tricky because in seeming so simple devoid of flourish and pose neither come out and proclaim what they are about their acting becomes not really acting but playing real people warts and all cactus flower is a story that never appears to take itself too seriously but reveals itself to be deep and very human after all
<START> i remember seeing this 1978 comedy at one of the bargain matinees i took in when i was looking for a study break from my college courses walter matthau and glenda jackson do some effective tracy hepburn style thrusting and parrying in this featherweight romp directed by the reliable howard he did private benjamin about a newly widowed doctor's aggressive re entry into the dating game it all breezes by quickly primarily thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter julius j epstein casablanca along with alan mandel max and future director charles shyer br br dr charley nichols has just come back from hawaii after his wife's death upon his return he becomes aware that he is instant to any and all the single women in la he works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chief of staff amos willoughby whom charley has to pacify to keep his residency enter ann atkinson a transplanted englishwoman who bakes for a living and has certain concrete opinions about the medical profession which she expresses freely on a pbs talk show of course charley is on the show's discussion panel and sparks as they say fly this leads to the standard complications about how serious charley is willing to become about ann at the same time the hospital has to deal with a potential wrongful death lawsuit from the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died at the hospital under careless supervision br br it's just refreshing to see such a mature yet bracing love story between two characters inhabited by actors who deliver lines with the scalpel wielding skill of surgeons matthau is his usual 1970's curmudgeonly swinger and quite a sight waddling with his gangly arms held akimbo in his power walk away from her heavy award winning elizabethan roles jackson is crisply sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as the feisty ann who thinks all doctors should aspire to be albert art carney plays willoughby with predictable bluster while richard benjamin provides amiable support as colleague dr solomon it's all very compact with a few nice jabs at the greed within the medical profession there are no extras on the 2005 dvd
<START> i particularly enjoyed review of this film and agree that howard is not the only damaged character howard is rather ruthlessly set up by the script but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or if she is that he murdered her howard doesn't know and neither do we in terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there he bolts however he never actually harms helen gordon no matter how enraged he is indeed he reacts with horror at helen's fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors then he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered helen with the almost pathetic i'm very tired now i think i'll go home frankly i don't think he's a psychopath a sick puppy certainly but not a psychopath br br the problem with howard is that he has no real male identity he wanted to serve his country but his mental condition denies him a place in the army he is singularly rootless and isolated no wife no girl no home again at least as far as we know and he does a woman's job are my speciality helen's niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his by exclaiming that she would want a man with a real job also although he finds himself strongly attracted to helen he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass he is remarkably powerless can't fight can't work can't make love br br helen is justifiably terrified however she tries to connect to him but finding that he doesn't respond normally i e way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose tinted memories of husband ned unwittingly presses all howard's buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escape br br both characters trapped in the house trapped by fear neuroses rage and memory deserve sympathy i know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers but i felt it fitted well as it offered a kind of release to the characters helen is freed i think from the past when howard tries on her husband's army coat helen's disgusted reaction is highlighted she no doubt feels that the sacredness of ned's possessions has been violated but hopefully her need to keep everything untouched has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger perhaps she can move on br br howard is also freed from his endless cycle of anger hurt and violence whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable but i hope it's the former br br great performances from ryan and lupino i prefer on dangerous ground but this is pretty good too
<START> when i reviewed the video for a local magazine i called it the greatest achievement in the history of the american cinema that was not wholly tongue in cheek tw tl remains best work and it's sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore however tw tl remains a striking exposition of what once was known as the american character largely on the strength of brian keith's superb portrayal of teddy r obviously milius and keith admired tr tremendously to make two films about him including the rough riders it's hard to fault this film at any level a splendid balance of action levity relationships and the serious topic of america coming of age in the world furthermore tw tl has exceptional appeal across the board note the stats showing it rates best with under 18 males females 18 29 and over 45 clearly candy bergen struck a responsive chord with women as well as men
<START> br br when i rented a thousand acres i thought i was in for an entertaining king lear story and of course michelle pfeiffer was in it so what could go wrong br br very quickly however i realized that this story was about a thousand other things besides just acres i started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended thank you jane laura and jocelyn for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie thank you cast for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness br br i recognized the angry sister the runaway sister and the sister in denial i recognized the abusive husband and why he was there and then the father oh oh the father all superbly played i also recognized myself and this movie was an eye opener a relief a chance to face my own truth and finally doing something about it i truly hope a thousand acres has had the same effect on some others out there br br since i didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land they weren't fighting each other at all i watched it a second time then i was able to see that if one hadn't lived a similar story one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all that is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance br br but yet another reason why this movie is so perfect br br i don't give a rat's ass pardon my french about to what extend the king lear story is followed all i know is that i can honestly say this movie has changed my life br br keep up the good work guys you can and do make a difference br br
<START> they should make terrorists watch this video as torture and not just for the disturbing final scene in which tying up and beating a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy about a half hour of this would convince even the fundamentalist to spill the beans rather than sit through even one more minute of this disaster br br this movie is awful i rented it because a friend said it was hilarious only to find he was talking about the blowhard director doing the commentary rather than the movie itself i guess if you find unrestrained arrogance funny you'll like this it apparently is true that he goes on and on about chicks he's banged the most tasteless example being when the lead actress comes on screen br br actually cj stacy was the only good part of this movie her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrid dung pile this apparently is the only movie she's done according to imdb i hope she is involved with theatre or indie stuff as i think she has the talent and natural beauty to really be an asset to any production
<START> if archie bunker was armed he may well have been joe however all in the family would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of this movie joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a bigot and has a big mouth especially when he's drunk one night he meets a man in a bar bill who is having a drink to soothe his frazzled nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's junkie boyfriend and he lets that slip to joe what happens is that bill's daughter was living with the junkie and she's hauled off to the hospital after an overdose and he goes by the apartment to collect her things but doesn't expect that he'll actually run into the boyfriend who comes in fresh from a big drug deal in the struggle that ensues the boyfriend is killed accidentally and bill doesn't want anyone really to know of course but he lets it slip to joe and then when the newspapers and tv reports come out joe sees them puts 2 and 2 together and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes he hooks up with him later and bill is of course concerned that joe is going to blackmail him but not for money he wants to hang out with him which is in a way almost worse now bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in and slips back home and accidentally overhears what happened and then is on the run and most of the rest of the movie consists of joe bill infiltrating the underground to try to find her this builds up to a rather shocking ending which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note or wrong note depending on your point of view a sort of decent but dim view of life in the early 70's mostly from a working class point of view which makes it not for everyone but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch 8 out of 10
<START> this is one heck of a sleazy film like so many women in chains films this one is chock full of lesbianism however unlike most prior films which strongly implied this black mama white mama shows an awful lot of skin as a horny female prison guard leers at the women as they shower as well as has sex with one of the inmates for the early 1970s this is definitely a soft core pornographic film sort of like girls gone wild goes to prison it's also a bad rip off of the defiant ones though in this case it's two hot females who hate each other who are chained together when they escape whereas the original film is considered a classic this one can only be considered a classic example of bad taste that's because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheap cheap thrills cheap writing and very cheap acting br br pam grier is the black inmate with an attitude a lady who was set up and sent to prison on this hellish island margaret markov is a revolutionary when they escape they both can't stand each other and have opposite goals however since it is clichÃ© driven there's really no surprise in how the film ends with their both becoming gag me friends
<START> i hadn't planned on seeing this movie however i wasn't disappointed when a friend dragged me along although there are no real surprises here the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budget br br if you've seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there's a pretty constant stream of jokes here with a couple of classic moments with the highpoint probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980's also i've read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment but i found it refreshingly different from what i had expected from this genre br br overall this movie wont change your life but it's got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout
<START> the war on everything is a weekly show from the guys that brought you and the chaser decides where each week the 5 chasers and firth break down the issues that we didn't know were important br br this show goes beyond the mere satirizing of politics and television by not being afraid to take the mickey out of anyone whether it be a counter girl at subway or even the prime minister of australia and although this may be familiar ground in say american television it has never been this well executed br br the war on everything is the smartest funniest and overall most entertaining show on australian television and if you haven't seen it you seriously owe it to yourself to give it a watch
<START> the curse of monkey island released excactly 6 years after the success of monkey island 2 you would think with monkey island 2's wierd ending that it would finish monkey island once and for all but it all turned out to be a trick to lure into captivity but enough about that the whole jist of this is that monkey island has returned and the voices are just phenominal if were to make a movie cartoon of monkey island this would probably be what it would look like and sound like it's plot is real good and everything about it is just awesome if you haven't heard about the monkey island series buy the monkey island archives or the monkey island booty pack and play through all the games starting with the secret of monkey island then monkey island 2 and the curse of monkey island monkey island 4 was real good but this one tops them all
