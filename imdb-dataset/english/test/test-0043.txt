<START> john leguizamo's freak is one of the funniest one man shows i've ever seen i recommend it to anyone well anyone with a good sense of humor
<START> set in the 1970s los angeles christopher boyce has just dropped out of seminary school and returned back home were his father gets him a job where he monitors intelligence documents his old friend lee is a ratty cock drug dealer and gets caught in a set up and must choose between becoming a narc or facing a long stint in prison when up on bail he jumps and heads to mexico city chris offers lee in a partnership to be his messenger to sell secret papers to the soviet union embassy in mexico city because of the disgrace he feels about the us government's control over weaker countries to their own gain but over time the two begin to clash with their motivations and find themselves in something bigger then they had originally intended br br director john schlesinger has spun out such films like the respectable midnight cowboy marathon man sunday bloody sunday and day of the locust while the falcon and the snowman might not be held up that high there's no question that this sombre espionage drama inspired by a true incident is an unjustly overlooked character portrait everything about it is quite a subdued affair with no real grandeur qualities hitting a massive mark the driving factor of the film has got to be the admirably versatile lead performances of timothy hutton and sean penn as the two ambitious young lads chris and penn is especially good with his uneasy intensity which works well off hutton's superbly cool and collected turn what starts off as easy we watch the situation gradually crumble as the two amateurs find themselves really out of their league the strongly detailed and symbolic predatory behaviour plot mainly centres on the pair's relationship and that of their for their actions which eventually shows us the developments that led to their downfall the plan opens up like a wound to never properly heal due to drug addiction which really makes him go off the rails and leaves chris to pick up all the slack the searing political aspect is there but it focus on the themes of idealism boyce and greed lee to get its point across both don't mix and results show suspense is justified through its stimulating pot boiling script and character interactions then that of any visual gimmicks action is very little but still there's a pressure induced style to schlesinger's assured and realistically dark 'n' gritty direction pacing is mostly well handled although some sequences do seem to wallow on for too long but however it grips you as it plays on its authentically paranoid tone to slowly build up to an exploding tight latter end adeptly fleshed into the technical production is an harrowing music score and professionally poignant cinematography the supporting cast are exceptionally fine with pat hingle lori singer david suchet boris jerry hardin and joyce van patten also look out for michael ironside in a tiny part as a fbi agent br br a mostly outstanding spy film that benefits largely from talented lead performances and by not playing the usual stakes it's more an emotional ride then a complex one of twists recommended
<START> it would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a north korean spy but survives the bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge as well as sex unbeknownst to her she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of george w bush in her purse a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments just call it a romp and at least a few people will show up to the theater i'm not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in new york this past april but i sincerely hope not many it sounds like a light and playful pinku flick but it has art house pretensions and is really just incredibly boring many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations but this film's aspirations just make the time that elapses between the sex scenes excruciating and then the sex scenes aren't even good i've seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty japanese movies i've never seen this country produce something with sex this dull the spice channel is more imaginative the only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress emi kuroda otherwise this is pure torture
<START> i'm surprised that mine so far is the only comment on this t v movie as far as i'm aware the series itself has had a huge following reviewer pundits and real people alike have praised it to a person anyway let me tell you right away that if like me you're a sucker for gritty police dramas you'll like the lost child the heroine throughout the prime suspect series has been battling the male police establishment throughout the series getting to her present comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard work obstinacy and sheer talent for police work she is essentially an ambitious career woman but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man hater unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours which her career demands and she has never married so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and her entire police job let alone future advancement or having an abortion which she opts for this abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama it's very skilfully dealt with in less than a couple of minutes screentime a marvel of economy in scripting and editing but it's always there as a counterpoint to desperate efforts to find another lost child a kidnap victim before it's too late the story takes many twists and turns before the surprise ending and one is fascinated alike by the plot and characters although i found the many villains a little overdrawn the police and especially herself are not always competent nor that likeable which figures given the unpleasant job that they have to do in the sleazy underworld which this series habitually inhabits br br mirren herself has said that she'll make no more movies in the series but excellent as she's always been in the role of the series itself is as actor proof as is another addiction of mine dick wolf's american law order whoever appears therein each could go on forever as is my fervent hope
<START> i know that trey parker and matt stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every single episode of south park if not showing them then mentioning them and they love to mock and joke and make fun of themselves too but i felt this mockumentary went too far br br for one thing the most common running theme in the documentary is that they're episodes are meaningless pieces of crap they put out just for the money obviously that's completely untrue if you even bother to watch any episode and the constant you know i learned something today 's said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters the creators are also depicted as pompous arrogant asses who only care about money including a supposed to be funny but isn't scene involving isaac hayes delivering lines for chef over the phone and trey parker yelling and screaming at him for sucking and hanging up i guess it's supposed to be funny but the pretension in it just really made it cringe br br the way they interview employees working for trey and matt shows the duo as tyrants who push their employees to the limit all just for money in the end completely untrue obviously and all a joke but it's just not funny it's disturbing even though it's just a joke
<START> this movie stars ben kingsley as frank a hit man for some russian mobsters based out of buffalo he is also a raging alcoholic and this has caused his job performance to decline after he falls asleep in his car during a would be hit his mob boss uncle sends him to san francisco where he is to attend aa meetings and get a job as a assistant if you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense you're not alone br br it gets worse well it actually gets better but not before getting much much worse frank suddenly becomes a master mortician in spite of a complete lack of training but his reactions with the people in the funeral home and the aa meetings are interesting the viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in his life luke wilson is a welcome addition as frank's sponsor although he is given almost nothing to do his character does tell us he is gay but this ends up having no significance whatsoever the movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the tea leoni character she is completely unrealistic and her role as a love interest to frank flounders as the two actors have no chemistry together around the time she comes into the picture frank becomes much less engrossing as a character his characterization is seemingly random there is no consistency in his behavior the comedy is low key and only intermittently funny especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the cast br br problems abound in this one kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent it alternates between italian russian and hispanic throughout the course of the movie frank tells numerous people he is a hit man including an entire aa group but nobody seems to care or wants to do anything about it the movie relies on clichÃ© scenes to carry it through its final act most notably when insufferable character chases frank down at the airport just when he is about to board a flight back to buffalo br br though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half hour the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and devolves into complete nonsense at the end of the film frank celebrates one year of sobriety i hope to celebrate many many years of not having seen you kill me br br my grade d
<START> making a film based on a true story particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 plane crash is hard for even the best filmmakers but the mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick don't even try the actual names of both the survivors and the casualties of the uruguayan air force plane crash have all been altered the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip shod manner and the cannibalism aspect has been unnecessarily and gorily played up shockingly it made a ton of money on both sides of the border thankfully thought it has mercifully been forgotten but the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting guyana cult of the damned br br this cheap horror exploitation flick necessitated the making of alive some fifteen years later that film was a masterpiece survive to put it mildly is not
<START> i picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to my first thoughts were that i have never been more ashamed to be an indian as well as a hindu i found this movie to be down right appalling please don't waste your time as for the music there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap the beautiful scenes are not what india is known for i just hope that i have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is yes it may highlight how evil people in power especially when it comes to religion may be but to sit down and watch almost 2 hours of this movie can make almost anyone gag if your up for a good indian movie watch something by director mira nair
<START> the 1980's 'my dinner with andre ' with wallace shawn and andre gregory is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit 2005's 'you are alone' demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul br br the story revolves around three principal characters there's daphne a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life then there's the prostitute or paid escort britney as self confident as daphne is self conscious what makes them interesting is that they share the same body if not the same personae part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the early scenes where daphne approaches a door of an aged hotel room she halts and is obviously torn by the decision of whether or not to knock on the door Â but it is britney that effortlessly glides into the room when the door is opened br br on the other side of that door is buddy a middle aged nobody with few if any personal qualities that anyone would find attractive he goes so far as to be confrontational about britney's chosen profession as soon as she enters the room however we soon learn that buddy is daphne's next door neighbor and has watched through the years as she grew from little girl to womanhood this complicates things for the audience is buddy just being a concerned neighbor or does he want something else br br if it's sex that buddy wants here it is britney loves sex her definitions may be but that doesn't lesson her enthusiasm she prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic wristbands that her clients are invited to chose from each color band denotes a specific act that she'll perform Â but exactly which act isn't revealed until after the band is broken off her wrist and the choice is irrevocably made br br britney is or believes that she is in control of every encounter even when blindfolded and bound as she is by one of her regular clients she imagines her arms and body being stroked by multiple men but her legs and pubic area being by a woman in blood red lingerie the film's imagery just keeps coming br br buddy's pathetic life is one of acceptance he's lost his wife his dog even his fantasies of the pretty teenager next door it's no coincidence that he's lured daphne or britney to this particular hotel room there's a painting on the wall of a dinner plate with only a fish head left this is a perfect metaphor for buddy's life all of the good parts are finished so it's here where he brought his wife when they were still college students that he makes his stand Â to regain some control of his own life to make his statement br br the director of 'you are alone ' knows his craft the principal action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film assisted by a myriad of inter cut scenes that add dimension to the characters their circumstances and conflicts br br as the film progresses britney asks buddy if she should get undressed he says yes but she strips only to her underwear an actual prostitute would probably remove all of her clothes one of the five gets but it isn't buddy that's being teased we are as the film concludes we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in play a tease doesn't work unless it actually delivers britney does so does 'you are alone'
<START> admittedly i watched the mst3k version of this but it's not actually too bad outright at least compared to others which deserve my cinematic hatred br br the story centers around a troubled girl wrongly sent to a reform school called girls' town along way races redemption and wackiness unintentional happen the story and acting are a little flat as is the action however the entire thing is actually entertaining to a degree if you are absolutely bored br br overall just a simple sub par 50's flick but far from the worst movie ever made with some bright spots in the movie the ave maria sequence was good for me br br if you get a chance to watch the mst3k version you won't be disappointed by it self not so much but i can think of worse methods of torture anyone
<START> i saw this film at temple university i cannot imaging that anyone will ever see this film in a theater projected on film the acting is similar to saved by the bell the tv show the plot is simple and unimaginative the sound recordist likes the sound of wind and the dp needs a light meter vampires vampires vampires br br don't waste your money
<START> jack frost 2 was a horrible terrible sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie the original was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste and the snowman went around murdering people and avoiding blow like the plague this however was a far cry from the quality of the original it seems like this even had a lower budget because for some reason after an hour into this film i still hadn't seen the snowman some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character disappointing to no belief even for a fan of bad cinema
<START> drug runner archie moses introduces his friend rock keats to his boss drug kingpin frank colton unknown to moses keats is actually an undercover police officer during the bust on colton's factory moses accidentally shoots keats in the head he survives the wound later arrests moses dodging colton's hired assassins the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive br br adam sandler's films are usually a hit miss affair with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone this one is not as stupid as his other films but still cannot overcome a lazy script the direction is incredibly patchy with fast paced action sequences giving way to slow comic exchanges between sandler damon wayans some of the action scenes Â flying a plane with no engines a car chase at night through a forest Â are quite absurdly contrived the acting is the standard for this genre with sandler wayans making a good pairing in short the film is dumb but fun to watch br br grade c review by m k geist
<START> its a spoof its an intelligent comedy it has some a pathetic action and choreography and mind it it is intentional good hummable songs good performances by the entire cast brilliant by amir salman and paresh and over all an script which is so rare in indian cinema that too in comedy watch david dhawan etc story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways they come across one such way when they find out that a rich nri is coming india to get married rest of the story is about and how these wastrels try to out wit each other entire cast is perfectly cast right from verma till viju songs are rightly placed and are funny surprise package is salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy br br all an all a film which you should not ignore if you like and watch indian cinema
<START> spoiler it gives away the very irrelevant ending br br at the beginning of this movie there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies h g lewis he talked about how this movie was lost and then found years after the director's death he also talked about how gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood used in it blood feast was a 2 10 000 maniacs was a 5 but then he goes and claims that dr gore was a 15 i want to know where half of the 15 gallons went watching the movie i saw very little near 15 gallons agreed there was a fairly large amount of blood but no where near 15 gallons some of the dismemberment scenes were definitely pretty gory and realistic strings of flesh and all but i wouldn't say 15 gallons br br end does that sound familiar that's what you should have been saying near the last half of this movie after the igor character was tossed into the acid bath the movie slowed to a painful crawl there was no coherent end as it didn't fit into anything the 90 minutes before it provided she drove off in a van with a total stranger big deal that's what happens when you keep an individual i won't say person because she doesn't qualify as a person very innocent about the world around her the doctor teaches the girl that a man is to be loved so every man she meets she loves br br even though h g lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we may not like the acting the directing or even the gore i will go with choices a and b both were terrible it was enough to give me bad dreams of cut editing and people with shifty eyes as they talk to one person but i made it through the movie and came out stronger too bad i couldn't say the same after finishing robo c h i c br br this was a bad movie i can usually take my doses of vinegar in good stride but every once in a while you get a movie that bites back i think this movie took off an arm or a leg haha sigh admitted i did enjoy the stare down scenes where the good doctor stared at his future victims and opened his eyes really wide and just stared it was very similar to in blood feast when he stared at that lady in his catering shop and did not use his power after that i guess this movie picks up where powers left off br br final judgement the movie should have stayed lost good day br br scott
