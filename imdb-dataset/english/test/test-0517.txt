<START> i just watched this movie on bravo and it was absolutely horrible it has the plot of a shannon tweed movie without the nudity the premise was interesting enough a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money the characters were trite as were the observations on human nature and greed br br for a movie called class warfare it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending this movie could have done a lot better if there had been more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was a who done it br br the acting wasn't fantastic but it's hard to seem believable with such a terrible script lindsey is very cute and i'd like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script she's probably the only reason why i sat through the whole movie br br
<START> sure it is a new take on vampires who cares i would rather the old take if it is entertaining this was not entertaining it was a dull story poorly acted with annoying cinematography save your money don't even watch it on video
<START> one of the most awaited movie i thought himesh will do a bit of acting but alas all my hope went wrong given that the heroine is 15 yrs old omg what did they thought before considering the actress may be its because no wants to work with hr as he is called in the film human resource as many people wrote in nevertheless it was a disappointment i hope the producer doesn't make himself bankrupt by making a part 2 of this as this news is roaming around the story was predictable one with himesh showing his generosity character throughout the movie which i doubt very well br br anyways the movie is good from those people's angle who thinks himesh cant do anything wrong 4 out of 10
<START> this tv series is about a foolish and unconventional english gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps br br i remember watching mr bean with my family back in 1990 when i was still a child my family laughed so hard at every episode and the contents of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later the memorable scenes which are still in my head include mr bean attempting to get out of his car park shooting out the lights counting sheep and him in the swimming pool we bought all the mr bean videos on vhs no mater how expensive they were it was worth it because we watched them over and over again it is so rare to see a very funny tv series that is suitable for all ages
<START> honestly people who gave this movie a ten would have given 100 for pulp fiction this is the level that we are dealing with here br br the movie isn't bad but no way is it like omg the best movie since pulp fiction some people have incredibly low expectations for movies even those of indie variety personally i found my interest in the movie waned after the half hour mark the plot defies logic and belief you have got to hear the part about why the wife did what she did in order to save her husband yeah right i guarantee that you would walk out of the theatre thinking hmm now that doesn't make sense at all this is one movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and belief br br those who said that the music score is good were probably listening to their mp3 players it absolutely killed the movie in some parts br br in conclusion watch the movie only if you have nothing particular important to do i give this a three because there is one long sex sequence in the motel which is decent
<START> ok i was bought this a few ago by my brother in law who took me to see get shorty in the cinema which the both of use were uber impressed with and watched both get shorty and be cool one after another i have read reviews of people that had not seen get shorty and thought this film was quite good i just think its another way for film companies to cheat the paying customer all i have to say about this film is wtf after nearly 10 years and chili palmer had become a pussy the script was basically the same they teamed up travolta and thurman after their success of fiction threw in a couple of big stars plus a shed load of nobodies and thought that it was going to be good vince vaughn's character was just annoying despite me being a fan of both him and the rock both of the actors were way under utilised and unrealistic basically i am glad that this was bought for me as a present as if i had paid money for it i would have been super annoyed
<START> ill conceived sequel the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather brings back the spirit of the psychopath returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which life to his molecules it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept br br i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so exhausting anyway the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival i mean seriously why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this br br the snow anvil murder scene takes the cake ice icicles from the beach's sand so that a victim can fall on them oh and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs br br look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your oh it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie or have you pondering why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense jack frost has the power to freeze water then how were they able to melt him in the first film and causes the island resort to snow one sequence has jack freezing pool water encasing a swimming model under the sheet result being her drowning with nowhere to escape oh there's also a recreation of the tongue stuck to the icy pole bit from the christmas story dude br br i gotta hand it to the cast though they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining christopher allport perhaps unwisely returns as sam to face his old nemesis as does eileen seeley as his wife the attempts at tongue in cheek humor for me at least fell flat but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue br br a development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with jack his genetically altered water molecules thanks to the introduced foreign elements allow him to withstand anti freeze and even worse he now can reproduce through indigestion jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes mouth and sharp teeth the killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans but i personally found this junk rather hokey that's the purpose behind it i suppose cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this and unbearable the snowball offspring is an obvious homage to gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort the weapon against them bananas it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film both fell in a truck bed full of anti freeze an icicle emerging from jack's belly was penetrating sam's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed and i guess in their being being linked by the icicle jack inherited sam's banana allergy or so this is what we are led to believe and in doing so both merged in a sense br br phew such a film as this defies simple explanation it's a film with effects and plot so terrible one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many failings
<START> when at the very start of the film paleontologist donald sutherland arrives at the argyle family's house and it comes out he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago your sensation is that you are about to watch a top thriller an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around but as the film runs along your disappointment increases inevitably br br ordeal by innocence is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn't raise at any moment nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity wether you guessed or not br br donald sutherland cristopher plummer faye dunaway and sarah miles far from her good performance in ryan's daughter just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either br br you won't miss much if you skip this one
<START> thank god for this movie it's a document of talent that three decades later seems even more unique and rare in retrospect br br the music is just extraordinary packed with so much talent in writing performance arrangement and production that it's absolutely infectious the lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible the performances by under appreciated talents like nell carter and ren woods uplift my spirit every time i hear them while the film may be different from the stage version i prefer the soundtrack to the cast album which i find truly grating and under developed here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldn't have been produced in a stage setting br br but the music isn't the only thing extraordinary about this movie the juxtaposition of almost hyper realist dialog scenes reminds me of altman films intercut with exuberant musical and dance numbers really works all the talent in this movie directing writing photography editing music choreography casting acting costuming art direction merge perfectly into one of the best musical films i've seen br br i think it's amazing how much we know about the characters in hair based on very little information or plot they're not drawn as caricatures but as realistic and very human people we see little glimpses of where they come from but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting directing and editing there's an undercurrent theme of the misogyny of berger and hud which colors their characters by exposing their reckless macho hippie ideology the scene of home life reveals important details about his psychology and the brief glimpse of claude's home tells us volumes about his background through the simple realistic and genuine interaction between claude and presumably his father br br i love the fashion in this movie it defiantly mixes sixties ideas with very seventies looks one does have to overlook treat williams' hair extensions it's a document of how chic much of the late seventies was contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste claude's beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979 and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers particularly those in white during the central park scene mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musical's themes these elements merge with extraordinary state of the art choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both br br hair isn't a film that rewards cynicism if you come to it with expectations then you're most likely going to be held captive by artists who aren't bound by your rules for me it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day
<START> the movie has started the wheels spin your car has entered a race against the fox you're behind you can't get in front you figure if i go out i'm taking you with me you smash into the cars parked on the side of the road you turn to hit fox but your aim is bad bang you've gone up the back of a vw and smash you've landed in a reservoir your car lights on fire you could get out if you wanted but the shame of losing has taken you bang your car blows up everyone looks on in despair some crying the sound of a siren tells you the cops are coming everyone gets in their cars and bolts leaving you to burn the charred remains of the cars frame sits there haunting the on lookers you're dead br br this is one of the scenes actually its the first scene in the movie there are many more like it as you enter the cockpit of the fox in his pimped out ford terry serio in his crazy and many others in this blast from the past john clarks masterpiece running on empty he'll win at any cost
<START> i probably have to blame i sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title black dragons and revolves on secret wwii conspiracies nazi plastic surgeons and revenge this film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure the actual plot which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing only becomes clear during an explication near the end but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before we see how horror icon bela lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent american politicians and kills them one by one the story is timed right before wwii and Â especially after witnessing the ending Â it surely is a premise with lots of potential so it's quite a shame it isn't elaborated more proper there is however one great dialogue that i can't resist sharing man towards woman do you want to marry me why so i can beat you the only way you'll leave this place it's the only highlight in an overall very boring movie bela lugosi is lovely Â as usual Â but his spooky performance alone is hardly worth purchasing this film if you're interested in seeing other ghoulish performances of his in movies with decent screenplays check out invisible ghost the corpse vanishes white zombie and of course the 1931 dracula version
<START> i cannot believe how perfect this movie is great cg graphics good storyline and the fights oh the fights this movie was great the characters they look real enough to be considered real they definitely resemble the ones from the game perfectly the scene in which well all the scenes made my jaw drop fantastic 10 10 graphics the story perfectly explained plus the way comes to help cloud at many different times in the movie they explain it very well and make your jaw drop from how perfect it is but the repetitive fights do take some story out but that is only a minor thing story 9 5 10 everything else great the movie was just amazing i really do not know what more i can say except that this movie was pretty much perfect i loved it
<START> the end of suburbia is an important documentary about modern dependence on cheap energy and the coming peak in world oil production the film is an excellent introduction to the peak oil phenomenon and includes interviews with experts like adviser to vice president dick 2001 energy task force mathew simmons author richard options and actions for a post carbon world and author michael t blood and oil the dangers and consequences of america's growing dependency on imported petroleum br br economic growth is predicated upon more electricity electricity is predicated on hydro carbon energy period and mathew simmons made a very clear statement he said future growth is not possible and for a guy from his background to say that was one of the most that's like the catholic church saying the earth is round before galileo michael c ruppert br br the peak has happened and now instead of being prophets we're now historians kenneth
<START> inspired casting charming and witty throughout much like the currency in the opening moments of the film the story floats along magically until you are emotionally invested in its outcome the city of buffalo has never looked better kudos to the burton sisters and the entire cast for a job well done
<START> i saw this at my city's independent cinema no surprise because no mainstream theatre would want its fingerprints on this train wreck br br the camera work is very distracting the constant shifting and zooms could induce a sensitive person to have motion sickness it looks more like a film student's project than a serious movie br br though well acted the characters are unlikeable josh is devious always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage without any context to emily and josh's relationship she comes off as a whiny insecure girl who's desperate to get married rhett is an emotional infant incapable of understanding the complexities of human interaction without any redeeming qualities i didn't care about what happened to any of them br br obviously some people liked this movie as the couple sitting behind me were laughing hysterically of course they could have just making fun of it i could hardly blame them for it
