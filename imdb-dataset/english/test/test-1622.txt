<START> i think this movie has got it all it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head it has cool looking characters is really funny you know the kind that you'll crack up on the ground and you'll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks despite the bad acting bad cgi and bad story about cops going after a robot its really cool its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more times br br there are so many funny parts like when kurt was trying to get edison's attention and gave him the finger and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball on that part i kept saying remember remember to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened there was also a really funny part when ran into the room and kurt was there just before they fought and kurt was talking about his strange dream and how he was superman i loved that part although it has been a while since i saw it so i don't remember that part everything the actors said were funny like how kurt says i worship you like a god to the robot br br although there was some bad things in all it was a great movie man i can't stop laughing i wish i had that movie
<START> the mascot is ladislaw starewicz's masterpiece it tells the tale of a stuffed toy dog who searches for an orange after he overhears the mother tell her daughter she hasn't any money the dog gets picked with other toys to be sold off in the truck after the others jump off while the vehicle runs the dog stays and waits to be picked up from store before setting off on his own he manages to get orange after biting woman's leg as she was holding and selling the fruit as he runs he encounters the devil and accepts his offer to stop at nightclub there he meets the other toys who jumped off truck the cat who was next to him in vehicle is especially determined to get dog's orange i'll just stop here to mention that other wonderfully bizarre things happen in nightclub that you'll have to see for yourself suffice it to say if you love starewicz and is interested in all animation from the past i most definitely recommend you seek this one out
<START> the first thing you should know about is that it was shot on video so it has that peculiar home video ish look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a real film and indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a real serial killer thriller it's not quite that but it's not as bad as it looks either having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre dona adams gives an appealingly amateurish performance in the role her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her plus she puts up a great fight against the killer at the end the red herrings appear ludicrous at first but ultimately they work i guessed the killer incorrectly and you have to wonder if perhaps tarantino had seen the guy when he came up with the idea of the gimp for pulp fiction 1 2
<START> if you haven't seen this yet you really should on dvd i can't believe how much i enjoyed it it is amazingly realistic and believable true much of it is speculated and i would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts there aren't many of them but it handles everything quite well with a cruel mother nature theme it will remind you of the nature programs that you've seen on animal planet and the discovery channel only the animals here are dinosaurs they act natural they eat kill mate play and fight for survival you will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others br br for the most part the effects are excellent at times they will look a little too much like but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic in some cases you will actually be convinced that you've seen a dinosaur my favorites were the the raptors the the the and the arctic bipeds i was most disappointed with the t rex however which looked a little too computer generated at times br br in any case you should definitely see this production it is educational well made and very entertaining for what it is its an a
<START> okay so i'm a sucker for a good documentary particularly where it tells a modern day don quixote story a caveat i met mark in the winter of 1995 96 while he was still working on coven but i'll save that story for later american movie which commenced production not long after accurately portrays the person that i knew although in greater depth than i expected or believed existed this is simultaneously a very funny and very sad film and is brilliantly executed mark comes across as his own worse enemy his childlike ambition and optimism which i admire is undermined by his apparent artistic ineptitude as well as his bizarre fiscal expectations but he's also a charismatic guy his loyal sancho sidekick is equally likeable loyal if frazzled to the core like don quixote american movie presents an often ignored inefficient aspect of freedom that people will be drawn toward professions to which they are not particularly well suited irrespective of repeated failure it is a great film
<START> emilio estevez actually directed a good movie who woulda thought i sat through two previous films estevez directed wisdom with then girlfriend demi moore and men at work with brother charlie sheen they are lousy films badly acted directed stupid and offensive estevez is a good actor but lousy as a director i turned this on in pure curiousity it has a great cast and i had nothing else to do damned if it didn't pull me in br br it concerns estevez coming home from vietnam permanently scarred by what happened over there his parents kathy bates martin sheen and sister kimberly williams try to reach him but can't something in vietnam has affected him deeply and he's about to explode br br a bit overlong but still very good a lot of the material is familar but the cast is so good that they make it seem new estevez is good sheen is terrific and real life father williams is touching and bates is just extraordinary trying to hold the family together it all leads up to a powerful ending which really surprised me br br well worth catching br br
<START> opera is a great film with some wonderful imaginative imagery an opera singer cristina is being stalked by a killer who forces her to watch him murder everyone she knows by tying her up and taping needles under her eyes this idea of the needles comes from the fact that argento doesn't like it when people cover their eyes while watching his movies for years i've been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the gorier moments in my films i film these images because i want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away so i thought to myself 'how would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to watch most gruesome murder and make sure they can't avert their eyes 'the answer i came up with is the core of what opera is about says argento plenty of suspense wonderful cinematography and brutal gory murders one guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a gushing wound daria gets shot in the eye while looking through the peephole etc for anyone who hasn't caught this one yet give it a try highly recommended
<START> obviously with this film going straight to dvd i wasn't expecting a lot but this film is so unfunny it is unbelievable the only part of the film that you actually may find remotely funny is before they even get to the island where eddie's son is blasted out of the bathroom by a jet of water and then that's it why do they bother at all the first christmas vacation with chevy chase was brilliant and hilarious this is not they rely on jokes concerning a dog with flatulence and a character called uncle nick who is about 80 and keeps trying to get his way with beautiful women when they approach the island on the boat the island in the background just looks so fake and randy quaid although funny in the previous film just overacts and seems like he's trying too hard to be funny you have been warned
<START> this oscar winning short film 40 minutes based on a short story by william faulkner takes us back to small town tennessee in december 1941 two brothers one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the south around this time well the japanese bomb pearl harbor and the older brother pete decides to enlist he gives his prize egg to his little brother willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte well willie isn't having any of it if pete can be a soldier so can he he heads to memphis showing his stubbornness and determination as he gets the better of several adults along the way after finding the enlistment center in memphis he demands to see his brother pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him in the process we are shown the devotion and love of a little brother jonathan he delivers a impeccable performance as a stubborn strong willed boy in the gentler times of yesteryear the movie tries and mostly succeeds in showing how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in one's youth as the two brothers reunite shortly the movie delivers a cathartic cry as the brotherly love envelops us all br br this movie is like a cold bottle of water maybe or good clear water with a flavorful mineral packet but not pure natural spring water like still it your thirst and you don't doubt its purity and effects it is more run of the mill and less expensive than some but gets the job done leaving one refreshed and afterwards 7 10
<START> one of if not the most visually beautiful film i have ever seen in my life there is so much to learn here in how to play with the camera color costumes and set up a shot the work that went into the official film web sites in english and french also give you a good idea of the sheer beauty contained in the film
<START> perhaps one of the first slasher film that came out after halloween although made from irwin from halloween i must say i honestly found tourist trap to be scarier and funner tourist trap is one of those remarkable treats you find every now and then and are left with the most enjoyable feeling of surprise it was destiny i tell you but one night i was at my local blockbuster one or two months before it went out of business and had nothing to get then i stumble upon this movie i think huh seems like a laughable b movie i rent it and took it home boy was i in for a good scare tourist trap comes off as a bad movie it definitely has it's cheesy moments but in the end you're having to much fun with it to really care br br the things that impressed me the absolute most and the things that made this movie one of the scariest ones i've seen is number one the setting a horror movie without a good setting isn't very fun not here i just love love love the location it feels like we can relate to it it almost feels like we've been there before which makes it creepier next is the characters non of them are really stereotypical and they all have a real personality for example they're not stoners alcoholics or even sex obsessed people they feel like normal young adults plus they look realistic enough and then their is chuck connors who gives a great performance as mr who we all take an instant liking too because again he's so real he feels like that nice guy grandfatherly figure we adore the last and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us the audience jump half way out of our seats and turn on the rights for the right reasons for example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch but in tourist trap prepare yourself that's not the case with it's perfect use of lighting mannequins and weirdness you feel utterly creeped out plus i love because although they may go a bit over the top with some things you still feel like this could happen which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a ridicules premise should do and that is make us the audience feel unsafe and terrified br br overall as far as any major problems go i have none only that it's weirdness may get a little too weird at times however in the end tourist trap holds a place near and dear to my heart for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel unsafe about traveling
<START> hi i have been looking 4 the soundtrack or a song from the film does anyone know who sung the title song i think it was called welcome home or coming home br br it is played throughout the film and for the end credits please can anyone help either the artist and or title of song thanks mike this is for all you movie buffs lets see if you know your stuff br br hi i have been looking 4 the soundtrack or a song from the film does anyone know who sung the title song i think it was called welcome home or coming home br br it is played throughout the film and for the end credits please can anyone help either the artist and or title of song thanks mike this is for all you movie buffs lets see if you know your stuff
<START> allegedly the true story of de the eldest daughter of the catholic queen isabella yes the same who funded columbus's expedition the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband the philip of austria known as the handsome and played in a rather manner by italian hunk daniele at his most and beefy here this is a groan familiar story of late 15th c early 16th c intrigue betrayal and bodice ripping it drips destructive lust from start to finish but while la reine margot succeeds in making cruel sensuality and ruthless cut throat intrigue entertaining to watch la just doesn't pull off it just ends up feeling like a big budgeted soap opera with below average lazy or over keen acting looks positively bored and pilar de in the title role Â though to be fair she may mature into a proper talent Â just seems to be trying too hard switching back and fourth from two dimensional horny looking to spoilt teenage hysterics all the way through some of the supporting cast are ok with the exception of another italian pin up voluptuous and beautiful but really no actress to speak of i couldn't in fact bring myself to feel any concern towards any character nor for that matter did i feel strongly in a negative way against any of the supposed villains what a waste of a substantial film budget this one sadly is just so rhetorical and deja vu nodding to other films in the genre rather than to its source material history for inspiration it seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historic era deserved a far superior film maker to evoke it
<START> the apolitical musicians eva liv and jan rosenberg max von sydow have been married for seven years and live in a small farm in a remote island to escape from a civil war in the continent they provide to a couple of costumers to raise some money and buy some supplies they love each other and eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby but the reluctant jan who is a weak and sensitive man does not want to have children when the rebels arrive in the island their peaceful and calm lives turn to hell and they get in the middle of accusations from both sides when colonel jacobi gunnar stalks eva jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man and the love and affection they feel for each other change to hatred and indifference br br shame is an antiwar movie by the master ingmar bergman focused by the eyes of a couple of artists that are apolitical and does not listen to the news but when the war arrives to their lands they have their love friendship and affection destroyed by the senseless soldiers liv and max von sydow have top notch performances as usual and i do not recall seeing the breast of liv in any other movie the process of of the pacific and sensitive jan rosenberg by the war is impressive and the bleak open conclusion is pessimist and adequate to the dramatic story my vote is nine br br title brazil shame
<START> i think this is one of top five movies along with deliverance smokey and the bandit boogie nights and city heat he also directed this one so he had a talent for that too like his buddy clint eastwood i wish he made more films like this or even a sequel to machine than the likes of stroker ace or cannonball run ii this is a tough gritty cop thriller with reynolds at the top of his game having the beautiful rachel ward in it of thorn birds fame helped too henry silva is the bad guy and he always does a good job at that the film also a great soundtrack too i highly recommend this wish it was on dvd in the uk an audio commentary from reynolds would be great as well 7 10
