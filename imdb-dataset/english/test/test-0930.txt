<START> i am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh so because of this it's natural that i'd choose this film especially because with john agar in it it was practically guaranteed to be bad sadly while it was a bad film it was the worst type of bad film dull beyond belief and unfunny at least with stupid and over the top bad films you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting here you never really see that much of the monster mostly due to the darkness of the print and the acting while bad is more low energy bad listless and dull br br the film begins with some young adults going to satan's hollow to neck well considering the name of the place it's not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces duh don't go necking at satan's hollow well there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky so what do the teens go yep throw a dance party a very very very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion so it's up to the sheriff agar and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of br br as for the monster it's some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask a bit like the monster in robot monster not exactly original and not exactly high tech to make it worse it makes snorting noises and moves very very slowly so slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it how it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me br br overall too dull to like even if you are a fan of lousy cinema
<START> so it's friday night and you want to go watch a movie all you want is something entertaining not too artsy or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions so you pay 10 to watch the mod squad the trailer to this movie should have tipped me off but come on it's three of hollywood's most beautiful people eye candy but that's about it a string of moving prada ads and what did hollywood producers forget a plot why are these kids running around the streets after some unknown enemy where are they but don't worry after a while you'll just stop caring i was on the verge of walking out of this movie because i thought sitting in my room and staring at the wall might have been more productive and free but by that time it was over 90 minutes it's only saving grace so still willing to waste 10 go get yourself a nice hot meal
<START> and thus was born the most amorous skunk ever to grace the silver screen while the plot has an abused cat painting himself like a skunk and inadvertently attracting pepe le pew called henry here pepe certainly steals the show no doubt chuck jones realized that this love seeking member of the had that special something necessary to be a star in his own right and so he cast pepe in for scent reasons four years later firmly establishing enduring presence on screens everywhere br br so while odor able kitty may be a place holder otherwise i try to imagine watching it for the very first time in 1945 could anyone have guessed that this supporting character would soon join the ranks of bugs daffy porky and the rest whether or not anyone did pepe remains one of the most likable characters to this day c'est l'amour
<START> very dull show whats worse its very racist the white guys are dumb idiots and the only romance is between a black guy and a white woman there is nothing interesting about this romance it is not exciting it is not fun they don't even seem to care for each other at all its more like the writers and directors wanted an interracial thing going on why this is so popular in media today it is social programming and will lead to no good there is always tension when too many people want the same thing this show is not worth the 20 bucks for the season its a waste of time and harmful to society at least when they use tv shows to sell products they are more discreet selling whatever agenda here is quite obvious and without clear thinking some may feel wrong to oppose it but some of us know better
<START> new year 2006 and i'm watching glimmer man again say what you like i find steven seagal's movies amusing like many comments good fight sequences i particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration bit like schwarzenegger's humour in the earlier action films although that tended to be self deprecating br br but the one i like here is brian cox one of the most versatile actors around pity about his hand and foot but so much for withstanding extended interrogation must have flunked that class at the farm br br as the films went on i wonder just how the ever thickening girth of seagal affected his movement never mind it's entertainment
<START> mr baseball is a film of paradoxes written and filmed as a light sports comedy it truly has a heartwarming core as human and universal as some of capra's finest at the plot level you have the paradox of baseball a fine old american game as it is played in japan turned around with american values cast off and japanese values imprinted upon the game some of the superficial sports comedy results from jack's uncomprehending disbelief at how is played in japan you also have a lead character who's presented as an over the hill aging baseball star but who is actually quite immature pro ball allowed him to postpone growing up and you have a lead character who is rudely resistant to the changes in his life that are being forced upon him refusing to accept the that life has given him in the midst of a new country a new manager a new team and a new girlfriend who have all welcomed him and try to accept him sound like heavy stuff not really it's a charming clash of cultures comedy that takes place on the national sports romantic and professional levels but if you watch it sensitively enough you will also find a great story about a man who has to abandon his immaturity and grow up way too late in life causing some amount of personal pain and finds success in places he never expected it i love the story but i also have great respect for performance he bares his tush literally to portray an ugly american insulting people and throwing tantrums in public then lets us inside this character to understand his dismay it also doesn't hurt if you're a big fan of ken like i am mr baseball is a surprising loss of innocence tale
<START> this game is one of the best horror shooter games i've ever played the plot is a little choppy but the game never fails to send you plenty of chills and excitement many people shelved the game when they found that there are no cheat codes for it and very little health potions and ammo to be found but actually after you've gone through the game once you are more familiar with the monsters and different rooms so you can easily get by the second time around the puzzles are great not too hard not too easy there are tons of different monsters so you never get bored and there are plenty of gaming areas you really feel like you're in a good stephen king novel as you play it's nice and creepy pick this game up cheap and have some fun
<START> for the very reason that i love movies such as central do brasil central station 1998 i really love chop shop there is no sugar coating there is no attempt to make these people's lives over to something more palatable or pretty what you see is what you get and that is often gritty and at times heartbreaking but that is exactly what makes a movie such as chop shop so wonderful alongside the fact that the storyline unfolds so elegantly and subtly for a young brother and sister who are about as close to homelessness as one would ever want to get working and living at an auto body repair shop in queens new york is as good as it gets is this a good or bad thing that is the question this movie essentially poses to the viewer this movie is really a fantastic slice of life piece that at times feels like a documentary instead of a drama and that is a great thing because it looks and feels so real in the midst of so so many current movies based on essentially surreal and often implausible plots stumbling upon chop shop is like finding a little gem
<START> wow i was really disappointed i wasn't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater and i wish i stuck to that plan it really should be a made for tv movie i was kind of excited to see it as i'm a big fan of fairuza balk but this movie didn't do her justice infact i'm a little disappointed with the acting all around what a horrible cover up of fairuza tattoos it bothered me every time i saw her shoulder br br there was no flow to the movie it was very hard to get into it one scene we get angry hyped up we want blood the anticipation rises just then the director takes us to another scene to show the love between annie and bobby it would have been more enjoyable to follow if it was broken up into three sunday paper comic strip br br there was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts the gangster leaders were scrawny guys not very believable matt dillon head of a mobster organization come on give me a break there was just no intimidation there br br the soundtrack wow i think this is one of the worst musical scores i've ever heard what awful guitar solos my god the sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasing to my friends i'm sure br br anyhow there is one positive comment i'd like to make about the movie the settings were nicely done i liked the colours a good job conveying that time period
<START> it's been a long time since such an original quite funny black comedy has surfaced if eating raoul is on your top 100 list do yourself a favor and find undertaking betty immediately the subject of death being funny has been attempted before see paul bartel and mary woronov in mortuary academy while that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy undertaking betty is much more steady with a better cast who could imagine that the undertaking business might be fertile ground for an original uplifting and heartfelt comedy i was surprised and you will be too i highly recommend seeing undertaking betty merk

<START> i loved this well i loved the romance part with colby and the girl rachel her name i honestly was only interested in those too i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that but please no more sad endings where they cant be it made me cry but the romance between them the plot the trauma everything was great i just was more into colby and rachel ha ha everything about this movie was thrilling the kind to keep you glued to your seat because i sure was honestly my only personal want would be more focused between the couple colby and rachel and at least a decent ending i hated the ending a better one could have been more thought out not the fact of forcing colby to his death and rachel having a son the ending would have killed the movie
<START> yet another gay film ruined by asinine politics final speech just about sent me running out of the theatre with its bumper sticker epigrams read the comic book it was based on for a much more entertaining experience
<START> this is truly awful the attempt at a comics adaptation ever committed to film every possible thing about this movie that could be bad is music acting lighting sets special effects about the only positives i can find are that sue looks cute in her blue tights and that the thing make up is almost passable face only that's it zip don't bother tracking down that bootleg copy it's really not worth your time even the aborted captain america movie from the early 90's is far less excruciating than squirming in your seat while you try to endure this mess
<START> yes i spelled that right this movie is so predictable the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability from the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced it is paint by numbers as to where this plot will take us the foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer you could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending br br catherine zeta jones and aaron did decent jobs in undemanding roles and abigail breslin played the cute role admirably it's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre the romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few sure it's an ok movie if you have nothing to watch but you won't miss anything by missing this one
