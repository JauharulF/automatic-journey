<START> james cagney racketeer and political ward get to become a deputy commissioner of corrections and visits a boys reform school the catch is that cagney is not in it for the graft he genuinely wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from a background like their's br br the villain of the piece is dudley digges who is a grafting and a sanctimonious hypocrite to boot one of the subtexts of the plot of the mayor of hell is that these kids are mostly immigrants and those that judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here a few generations note in the mess hall scene as digges offers a prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive digges is eating well but the kids are getting quality you wouldn't feed to your pet br br cagney has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lam that puts digges back in charge and setting up the film for it's climax br br the mayor of hell was a typical product from the working class studio and because it was pre code it gets pretty gruesome at times a later version of this crime school with humphrey bogart and the dead end kids was a more sanitized remake br br although cagney is fine in the lead role as is madge evans the school nurse the acting honors go to dudley digges hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken but kindly one legged ship's surgeon in mutiny on the bounty but digges is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he's in br br this film is not shown to often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays a whole lot of minorities would be offended today still it's a fine film br br interestingly enough a few years ago the film sleepers came out and it touched on some of the same issues i guess films about reform schools don't change in any time
<START> this movie was supposedly based on a non fiction book i'm not sure what book the script writer s read to write their adaptation but it has absolutely nothing to do with the true life adventures of frances in italy instead it is an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at every juncture to bash men note the following examples br br br br spoiler details br br br br bash number one lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in a divorce br br bash number two lane ventures into a local italian town and is promptly solicited by every male on the street br br bash number three lane is saved from the horny town folk men by a charming gentlemen she falls for him after an afternoon of love making she later finds out that he's already attached and cheating with her br br bash number four you have to broaden your horizon for this one because the reference is definitely is in the movie her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by sp fertilization i am told that in most lesbian relationships you have one person assuming the female role and another assuming the male role in the movie after the female has been made pregnant the male lesbian decides to run out on the relationship because she can not handle it br br in conclusion this movie has nothing to do with the book that it was supposedly based on
<START> peter lorre turns in one of his finest performances as a hungarian coming to the united to make a new life for himself and someday bring his girl across the big pond to be with him lorre's infectious optimism and bright outlook come off very effectively which makes the performance all the better when he has his face hideously burned in a hotel fire and when no one will give him a chance to work turns reluctantly to a life of crime lorre's range as an actor is seldom as apparent as in this movie with his jovial good natured immigrant to his depressing melancholic disfigured self searching for the truth behind what he believed america afforded him to his suave intelligent better than your average hood to his sympathetic dealings with a blind woman with whom he falls in love the story is well paced has some interesting twists and gives lorre many opportunities to shine director robert florey does a quality job behind the lens and all of the supporting cast help aid the film with evelyn keyes giving a particularly good turn as the blind girl i loved the ending and the truth that was shone to exist in lorre's character despite all the negative things society had done toward him for a little b picture the man behind the mask is good movie making for its time
<START> hoot is a nice plain movie with a simple message it seemed like that this film was for young children but i know that adults will like this film the storyline is pretty simple a kid who moved to florida must help a soccer jock and an outcast save burrowing owls from construction of a pancake house the message in this film is big especially for animal activists and lovers the message is about doing all you can to save endangered animals the acting in this film is decent all the three kids looked like they had good chemistry the music is not too shabby i liked jimmy songs in this film overall this is a good family film i rate this film a 9 10
<START> a lot of comedy in britain in the 1980s was insular misguided overly political and unfunny and the worst of the comic strip presents stuff fell into this category br br but this is at the other end a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels br br is dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying br br is he telling the truth bluffing double bluffing counter doubly bubbly br br i've probably watched 20 or 30 times and i still can't decide 100 that's the wonderful thing br br as well as there are big roles for other early comic strip mainstays french saunders pete richardson alexei keith allen nigel and robbie coltrane though curiously enough not br br all of the comic strip cast however much i disliked the hidden agenda of some of their members are convincing actors and turn in superb performances in this big screen outing while the richardson writing team's work is so often pure genius with nice little touches of detail throughout br br ultimately this is a study of crime criminology and human nature in all it's wondrous complexity and very funny with it you will not be disappointed
<START> i read the book in a summer book club and all of us there loved it my friends from that club agreed not to watch the movie lest the book be ruined i didn't agree and watched it recently with my younger brother and my parents br br i was pleasantly surprised the movie was very true to the book without losing it's own spirit the 'new kid' theme was shown just enough so that we get a feel of it but that's not what the story's about br br the acting wasn't the best i've ever seen but it was still good and the kids especially had a lot of energy the characters were interesting and the plot was cute and not too overstated it was a kids movie that works just fine for adults or teenagers too br br i wish there had been a bit more tough girl attitude from beatrice but she was still a great character mullet fingers was quite a bit like i had imagined him except his hair was a little obviously dyed with blonde hair and dark eyebrows roy worked very well as the little guy and the new kid especially interactions with his parents and friends br br the message and the ending which i won't discuss other than i liked it teamed up to make a great cheer up movie for a rainy day all in all this was a great film that you can watch again and again whenever you need reminding that the world isn't a horrible place after all
<START> lucille ball cannot sing or act or dance this makes the quality of her performance in mame all the more dreadful she's not allowed to do the low brow slapstick that made her a hit on tv so she has to rely on building a character unfortunately ms ball never learned that skill as none of the tender moments have any warmth how does she really feel about patrick or beau we never really believe the words she says that vacant stare of ms ball is suppose to convince us she is emoting but there is no chemistry between her and bruce davidson robert preston or bea arthur at all for this reason every scene she's in is flat br br moreover when ms ball opens her mouth to sing we are immediately made aware of the reason why the studios dubbed her voice for every other musical she starred in earlier in her career it was stated that she demanded her voice be used so this is a mistake of ego as well as leadership it is made worse when she is singing in voice over and she has to act the moment without words whoever thought that would work forgot who was playing mame br br i understand that rosalind russell did the role on stage and in the film auntie mame also i am aware that angela lansbury won a tony for her performance in the original 1966 broadway musical neither of these women were known for their singing voices but both could have pulled this off better than lucille ball why they went with her is the worst in blatant miscasting br br the only person that gets out unscathed is bea arthur she's big and wonderful catty and common in all the right amounts unfortunately you keep waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join in on the fun but the film never does and you can't no one besides bea arthur appears to be having any fun br br an additional bad review goes to director gene saks saks is known as an award winning director of musicals and comedies for stage and screen including the broadway musical this film is based on none of that skill and expertise is of aid here the poor editing and storytelling in this movie is beneath a director of his caliber that glaring error in the execution of the movie is not the fault of ms ball
<START> what you bring to the movie influences your view of it i brought 30 years in the air force to this and every time i see it i am moved by the ending would a youngster of 15 who's spent their life flying in jets feel the same way yet i can only just its impact on me br br jimmy stewart gives a wonderful turn as jimmy stewart considering he was a pilot and an air force reserve general he probably comes as close to being an expert on how a pilot would act as any man alive one can't fault his delivery or his acting he is a pilot being a pilot that's enough br br spoilers br br it's the final minutes of the film that continue to grip my heart lindbergh has been flying without radio communication and has no idea if anyone is even expecting him when he flies into the paris airport the uncertainty of the landing field draws you in what is it below those shifting circles that look like cobblestones or a field of corn must make you wonder is he in the right place they go on and on streaming past his vision until he gets low enough and see that in the paris night what he was seeing was the light of the city reflecting off the faces of the thousands of people waiting for him to land
<START> misguided miscast murky interminable lunacy given the high gloss mgm a budget treatment kate hepburn plays a bride who comes to suspect her rich handsome husband robert taylor is not the dreamboat she married but a psychotic killer mgm's attempt at a hitchcockian thriller is doomed from the start by a turgid muddled ludicrous script and the idiotic casting of hepburn as a jeopardized woman fearing for her life who could ever imagine hepburn afraid of anything louis b mayer forgot to tell vincent minnelli he was directing a thriller not a musical taylor is embarrassing only robert mitchum also cast against type as a good guy retains his dignity in a quiet low keyed performance karl freund's ravishing cinematography creates images of eerie beauty and was wasted on the wrong film end result parnell of the 1940s
<START> this show is my absolute favorite this show is intelligent entertaining and always full of surprises lauren graham is perfect as gilmore a single mother who is best friend alexis shines as the beautiful and intelligent rory gilmore and keiko is one of a kind as best friend lane kim i love the witty dialog it's what makes it unique about the show kelly bishop is wicked great as emily gilmore and edward is terrific as richard gilmore scott patterson is a joy as luke danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch the community miss patty babette mrs kim taylor kirk and other's are always laugh out loud funny quirky and interesting that always makes the snappy one liners stand out this show has changed so much over the years that it won't ever get old gilmore girls is an original and clever show that keeps you watching that is how good it is i give this show a 10 10 rating
<START> after watching this movie on a boring saturday afternoon i couldn't quite figure out why so many people liked it it wasn't heartwarming or clever it was merely an amalgam of every other mismatched people coming together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about each other movie ever made br br the characters are a stereotype we have the blacks the hispanics the jews the asians and the homosexuals and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do the black mother declares that it's all right then when it's mentioned that another black character is at church instead of helping prepare dinner because all blacks love church the hispanics seem only capable of speaking spanish when the greet each other or make exclamations the lesbians do nothing but cuddle and kiss and one of them wears a because all lesbians dress like ani difranco and the vietnamese family owns a video store in l a imagine that br br oh and the movie is called what's cooking because each ethnic family cooks a different version of what they think thanksgiving dinner should be the black mother wants and macaroni and cheese the hispanics are shown rolling the vietnamese family is deep frying spring rolls i'm surprised there wasn't a bottle of on the jewish table this is all shown via the time honored tradition of the musical montage where they play the rapidly switching the instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures isn't that cute anyway once the director is finished establishing how different everyone is he attempts to show the inner humanity that we as all people of every race religion and culture share by inventing implausible and overly dramatic conflicts for each of the families to deal with it would be a plot killer to mention what each of these conflicts are but rest assured that they are indeed surprises that is if you have been sleeping for the first half of the movie the theme of disgracing the family runs pretty strong throughout br br all in all if you're the type of person who enjoys those new fangled movies that revolve around the stories of unlikely characters intertwining well you still won't like this movie if you like extended montages of food being passed around a table then you need to put this in your netflix queue but if stereotypes and clichÃ©s are endearing to you then make sure you ask for this for christmas or or
<START> the movie is simply horrible 2 10 although actors are trying their best well sometimes that isn't much special effects are let me put it this way it would be better if there weren't any br br the script is based on prose so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie sadly it's the opposite there is nothing left of the original atmosphere and it's all very chaotic maybe they just had too much material to show in 2h time br br anyway if you would like to see this film i would recommend you to look for the tv series same title same actors even the plot stays the same that was made in the same time the movie did it is so much better 9 10 and the story there actually make sense
<START> in a tv movie 70's kind of way it's one of those movies that show up in the wee hours but rarely because more modern late hour schlock movies bump it off it has likeable performances by graves and wynn generally it's just a harmless little piece of nothing that doesn't offend too badly nothing good a lot that's mediocre
<START> this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life they said this was the man's answer to waiting to exhale all i'm going to say is that we really didn't respond at all i couldn't believe that it was actually made the director should choose another profession because he can't make a movie the script wasn't good it made no sense and was very messy bet movies are much better than this was and i was horribly disappointed to see the talented actor terrence in this bad excuse of a movie if i could turn back the hands of time i wouldn't go back to media play to never buy the movie i would just keep it wrapped sitting on the shelf instead of wasting my time watching it
<START> i was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story the majority of the scenes looked fake to me for instance when the one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it while she was eating the sandwich the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it it's funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should i say it was thrown out to give it effect this movie was not realistic at all it's highly doubtful that the events that happened were true that evening when the st experiment took place i believe that the house may be haunted but not on the night this movie was filmed the ending was amusing when tim and and other girl were chained down in the some sort of basement paul and madison found them and rescued them i would rather watch the blair witch project again then have to sit through the st experiment movie again as i said if the makers of the movie did not state that this was a true story with true events i may have like it more your better off getting more entertainment from the blair witch project even though this is not a true story either
