<START> this movie is excellent i watched the french version there are many subplots which usually detracts from the whole but they nicely unfold and concur to the discovering of one's real self main theme in fact the whole movie besides his background is the journey to the discovery of one's or someone else's self is the king really a good monarch trying to wage a war to end all wars or is he just a disturbed blood thirsty hoodlum is he a true king after all is the attendant to the queen mother just a lusty career driven spineless sock puppet or rather a sharp thinking bold individual will the dame concubine realize who the king truly is what's between the king and the old chancellor what's the secret everyone knows but won't tell what's the true reason the assassin quit his job subplots something i'm not particularly fond of are handled well and keep one watching until the end scenes are well crafted and cgi fits nicely in without going overboard suspense is properly maintained and actors are upto the task there is a lot of brain damaged smiling but that is how one was supposed to behave at the king's court as the dame concubine complains about realistic movie without superhero moments this chinese movie really puts hollywood cardboard gladiator etc to shame
<START> the tv show was slow moving and the characters were sometimes irritating only through the miracle of fast forward was i able to make it through the first 2 hours br br the write up indicates that it's some kind of comedy mystery but i didn't see much of either br br if it really picks up after the first 2 hours please let me know because i doubt that i will watch the rest without a recommendation br br this review is supposed to be without spoilers so i will continue in a vague non spoiler fashion i found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic i found myself asking a normal adult do that ' the man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was irritating and when the male lead interacted with him he looked pathetic would a normal adult put up with someone as irritating as him
<START> this is the type of film that makes you question your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and remind yourself that there are very few people whose body of work doesn't contain a few clunkers br br the casting in lelouch's films is of utmost importance because he puts the viewer into such intimacy with the characters the actors have to bring real screen magic to live up to the intensity otherwise it is just hollow br br none of the actors in this film had any of that screen magic in my opinion br br jeremy irons and patricia fell far short as the leads irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part lovable rogue didn't suit his strengths his brand of charm also hit a false note for me here persona is too decadence tinged to fit into a lelouch love story br br although i would hesitate to pass up any opportunity to hear an english accent i also think an american actor would have worked better in this role so many of the songs that sings are so closely identified with the of the particular lyricist that it seemed kind of discordant to then have jeremy irons playing the love interest even though logically it really didn't matter it still screwed up the flow of the movie somehow at least for me br br of course it would have had to have been the right american i think george clooney would have been great in the part and he would have brought the screen magic in spades brad pitt could also have done a really good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgy br br i was also very disappointed with patricia in reading about her i've learned that she has a hugely successful career as a singer and many fans so what do i know but i found her screen presence as a singer very boring she was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than she was a singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song nothing she sang moved me she was pleasant but bland br br in contrast someone like kate hudson who is not a professional singer and has only voice coach french still would have handled this part a million times better not to mention all that stunning french talent out there that could have been tapped into it was wrenching watching patricia take up screen space when there are so many charismatic french actresses who could have been cast instead br br the music was so important in this film it could not really work without the music working and since delivered so poorly in this respect the movie never really had a chance br br lelouch sealed the fate of this movie when he cast patricia
<START> 'steamboat willie' is the first cartoon with sound mickey mouse is working on a steamboat on board he is making music with all kind of tools most of those tools are farm animals this first one with sound is one of the better and funnier ones it has some very clever moments a short classic
<START> it came before the ten commandments land of the pharaohs ben hur and it's overlooked today how unfair based on mammoth novel it doesn't cheapen it novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice i hope it will be done some day whose message is essentially christian remains intact another of his books the secret of the kingdom first part takes place after christ's death in the holy land br br the egyptian is the rising of a monotheism close to long before christ the pharaoh wilding is some kind of messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world he asks to return good for evil and he has disciples who will eventually turn into martyrs the scene when simmons and the other worshippers of the sun god are slain is visually stunning looking like some pagan ballet for the priests on the other hand this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the populace and that's why they look for a strong man mature who can lead the army against the as well as against their dangerous compatriots another religion or non religion should we say is purdom who during two hours believes in nothing the sequence of the grain of sands is absolutely sensational and rises the whole movie well above the average peplum br br there's another fascinating side the movie looks like a flamboyant melodrama not only for the screenplay notably sister's tierney final revelation which predates the ten commandments by two years but also the splendor of the cinematography in his book about curtiz talks about a atmosphere blue and gold notably in the scenes which involve the prostitute who contemplates her reflection in the water of her bath supreme narcissism around the hero all the characters appear disappear appear again but when they reappear they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with consummate skill besides as such is often the case in modern melodramas the story is a long flashback framed by two short sequences showing an old man who's remembering br br this is a wonderful sword and sandals that had a strong influence not only in america but also in europa notably in poland where jerzy directed a spellbinding 1966 which owed a lot to curtiz
<START> when i first saw this show advertised to be on australian tv back in the late 90's i ignored it thinking it was just capitalizing on the kevin costner movie but then i caught an episode and i wish i had watched it from the start the partnership between sean pertwee and louise lombard was so well acted and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining it wasn't an overblown tv show that you can tell spent most of its energy in making things explode so that they could put that clip in the commercial to lure audiences and then not deliver on any other level the show delved into the lives of the two main characters and thats what made it interesting the stories for each episode where also well written with interesting guest stars who were good actors and of course there was a lot of action and intrigue which is always good but what was great was that there was humour and it flowed naturally from the characters it didn't appear contrived it was british but in a good way and if this show was made in america it would no doubt be on dvd by now i don't know why british tv production companies are not interested in releasing this show on dvd it was a great show and deserves a dvd release
<START> the film made no sense to me whatsoever good actors favourite he was great in uomo but that was made by giuseppe a great italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort but awful rambling script terrible editing and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say and ended up saying exactly nothing load of rubbish but the sort of film that certain intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it and unfortunately italy has no monopoly on these they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece i never thought much of as director i remember seeing his first film fists in the pocket or some such title in rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago i was living the time all the usual raved about it but it left me pretty cold i didn't think he was much of a director then and still don't age has certainly not improved him and this film must rank as one of his worst
<START> this should have been an amazingly funny movie but it falls flat on its face in fact i stopped watching it halfway through which is something i rarely do bill murray plays jack corcoran a second rate motivational speaker who is bequeathed an elephant by his father whom he had presumed to be dead before he was born he then has one week to get the ponderous across the country his adventures on the way are only mildly amusing at best janeane garofalo's considerable comedic talents go largely untapped anita gillette is impressive in her small role as jack's mother who has a lot of explaining to do and pat hingle stands out as a former circus associate of jack's father perhaps the second half of the movie was better than the first but i find that hard to believe
<START> this is the worst movie in the world the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a is this for real sort of way it was so cheesy and low budget they should not have even bothered there was nudity and violence for the pure sake of having nudity and violence and the effects were just so so bad you would not believe it think ketchup as blood and cabbages for severed heads do not rent this
<START> being an israeli jew of naturally sarcastic nature as well as a lover of different and independent cinema it always gives me pleasure to see a film that takes a view on the holocaust that's sensitive and respectful while also being original and unusual while i haven't read the book Â or for that matter heard of its existence prior to watching the film Â and therefore cannot like some other reviewers comment on how they stack up in comparison everything is illuminated gave me great pleasure and i can certainly comment on that br br to label everything is illuminated a holocaust film would be to do it great injustice even though it is undeniably about the holocaust so would labeling it as a comedy or a travel film although it's about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving everything is illuminated is about jonathan safran foer Â played to minimalist perfection by elijah wood in the most impressive dramatic performance i've seen him in yet with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all Â a young american jew and an obsessive collector of family and historical artifacts who travels to the ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis it's also about alex his tour guide through the ukraine and alex's grandfather what's fascinating about these characters is that in the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance out the melancholy nature of wood's character but both alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film and turn out to be at least as important as jonathan in fact boris as the grumpy self declared blind grandfather turns out to be the finest dramatic performance in the film br br aside from the surreal nature of the film and the characters the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and russian folk music the sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history what made everything is illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that from alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original viewpoint on this painful subject several excellent films such as the grey zone and downfall have already given us the point of view of the lower rank nazis who are presented as human beings who aren't necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of the war everything is illuminated presents a point of view rarely treated before alex's point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people Â and maybe his own family as well Â were capable of the change in alex's attitude Â and his grandfather's Â towards jonathan towards the holocaust and towards the jewish people in general makes the film a fascinating and original study in character development br br everything is illuminated is a terrific directorial debut for actor liev schreiber and one of the most original and unique films of 2005 it's a highly recommended viewing experience especially or anyone interested in the holocaust and world war ii
<START> i am sure i'm in the minority i know i am among my friends but i found this movie long boring and gratuitous the fact that the role played by denis leary is the most likable character the only other time i liked him at all was in a bug's life speaks volumes rene russo's character was irritating beyond belief and thomas crowne himself was flat and stereotypical to say he was two dimensional may be a little generous no the scenes with his psychiatrist did not help make him real br br with the exception of two wonderful scenes both involving the museum caper and not involving rene russo this movie made me wish i were at home watching televised golf
<START> when i saw that icon was on tv i was surprised i know that the first clue of where it was headed was the fact that it was on the hallmark channel has to be said sorry i was hopeful when i saw that ff himself was the exec producer but very quickly saw that the only real way that the tv movie and the book were similar were in the name and the character names only the tv plot was a ho hum to say the least but i concur that in and of itself the action was worth a 3 stars in my personal opinion mr swayze could have portrayed a valid monk however i think that in order to do the movie justice it would have been a far longer movie and i don't think hollywood itself would have gone for the plot of by subterfuge a case in point is the terrible film version of the sum of all fears need i say more
<START> as listed and stated in many previous comments this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit indeed more than 20 years after it was originally transmitted it is still watched and watched again and has a huge global fan following something which must indicate that the makers of this series undeniably got something right br br the root of the series' brilliance and remarkable appeal has however got to be that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters Â all of which are brought to life by marvellous actors the characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity in contrast to many other robin hood adaptations and indeed many other film and tv productions in general the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have apparent flaws while the baddies although put forward as evil and ruthless frequently can be understood and even on occasion seem quite sympathetic this very much makes robin of sherwood into a story about multifaceted real people Â rather than of good and bad people Â something which very much adds to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal also although very much being an action packed series featuring numerous amazing stunts which are remarkable in themselves seeing as this was made long before today's computer animation green screens and so forth thus behind every one of those endless guys falling off castle walls horses and catching fire there actually is a real person who at some point did fall off a castle wall or a horse or catch fire there is always amazing dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode in the final analysis however it is generally the series' baddies Â nickolas grace as the sheriff of nottingham robert as sir guy of and philip jackson as the abbot hugo de Â who get the very best lines and who more than often steal the show with their arguments full of wit and cant it's a wedding not a celebration is just one of their many timeless pearls of wisdom which seems to follow one through life br br 20 years after the fact it is indeed hard to believe that robin of sherwood was originally something made for television Â and apparently not with a great deal of money Â in order to provide fleeting saturday afternoon amusement for small children in great britain filmed in beautiful locations with clever amazing scripts and featuring remarkable stunts and fantastic actors Â many of whom give the performance of their lives in this show Â this in numerous ways seems to be more professionally made and have more production value than many a hollywood film
<START> this is definitely a good movie unlike what other people are saying and i have both seen the movie and the end is cheesy but that is part of the package to experiment with death is the same as trying to defy it so the movie is cool for those who wish to see a classic kevin bacon movie see this please take care greeting from istanbul we will write 10 lines if you really want us 2 but we think it is a waste of time bye the rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we just wrote it to fill the 10 line requirement which is crazy but we are kind people and will therefore adapt to the rules that are set out for us so people watch this movie not because we wrote 10 lines but because it is good and by the way we wrote 12 lines
<START> i like so many others on here bought this movie at my local wm in the two for 11 00 cheap o bin i love cheesy b horror and sci fi movies and this one definitely fits in that category pretty much what everyone else on here said is dead on yes it was bad but that was to be expected the main problem i had with this movie is that it was just basically boring i mean serious yawn o rama the acting was bad the costumes k mart skeletor outfit circa 1982 were worse and the editing was awful no continuity whatsoever mr skeletor ultimately dies in an explosion of sorts uh although he encountered multiple explosion throughout this move i guess the last one just took its toll on him apparently earlier encounters with this military group cough took its toll on his horse it would change from red to black throughout this crap fest even for a b movie do yourself a favor and skip it the only good it serves me now it to add to my dvd collection hopefully no one will recognize it when they look through my movie collection thumbs down big time
