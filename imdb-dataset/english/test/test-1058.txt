<START> this movie was crap the script is so full of holes i can't see how the producers agreed to finance it br br we are never given an explanation of anything the acting is horrible the plot sucks this movie was obviously written for those 8 and under br br i have to say this why are the high school classes only 2 minutes long teacher walks in finds a frog in the desk or drawing on the chalkboard and 30 seconds later the bell rings class is over the kids haven't even opened their books can we have at least a little continuity br br oh the dialogue milo jeter is the re incarnated aborted fetus zombie thing do we really need the line this is dr jeter's office dr jeter milo's father thanks for the tip i could never put that together myself it never gets any better br br why does milo talk the way he does even in the beginning was milo ever real' or was he never real just always what he currently is and if it was always that way why the unexplained milo had br br besides what is milo what are all the unresolved items for we see all these contraptions in his father's medical office and are never given an explanation of what they are for or what they have to do with the story what are the injections for what about the aquarium contraption they obviously aren't needed see the movie it'll make sense and what does this medication do to anyone apparently nothing since it has no effect on the lead actress br br this movie is a very very bad rip off of all the other slasher movies it's a really awful friday the 13th halloween slopped together by a 10 year old writer it's not cheesy enough to laugh at it's just an incredibly frustrating bore
<START> jacques audiard's directorial debut see how they fall aka les is our old friend the film with two different stories that gradually converge and turn out to be the same story after all simply told from different sides it's a shaggy dog story with matthieu simpleton following unlucky in cards drifter jean louis trintignant with mutt like devotion that even stretches to killing for him when he's asked to repay his gambling debts in kind meanwhile in a slightly different timeframe jean over the hill travelling salesman becomes increasingly obsessed with finding the hit man who put his cop friend into a brain dead coma his life income and relationships gradually stripped away as he gets closer to his prey yet while it may offer the perfect setup for a modern day neo noir the film is often more surprisingly playful more interested in quirks of character and a slightly skewed sense of humor aptly served by the occasional ironic captions and alexandre desplat's half jaunty half discordant score than the traditional thriller set pieces and plot mechanics br br unfortunately the film is ill served by one of the worst region 1 dvds released in recent years the picture quality on disc is so poor at times you keep on expecting to see the audience's heads in front of the picture like a pirate disc
<START> what a waste of time to watch this movie poor picture quality poor sound poor acting and definitely not based on actual facts the deputy's girlfriend did so much overacting as did the sheriff that it was more comedy than horror the deputy tries to make an emergency phone call by dialing 911 problem in 1957 that emergency number was not in existence that is just one example of glaring inconsistencies br br the scary aspect was way underdone just did not come across as horrific br br i did think that the actor playing gein did the most admirable acting job in the whole movie i could well see mental disturbances in his character portrayal br br sorry this one just does not get it
<START> the four signs on the road say if you're looking for fun you don't need a reason all you need is a gun it's rabbit season br br in the woods we see hundreds of rabbit season signs posted on every tree we see more and more signs pointing exactly to bugs bunny's hole who's putting up all these signs daffy duck br br daffy puts the last sign up away and says to us the audience awfully of me i know but what the hey i gotta have some fun besides it's really duck season br br from that point we now see elmer fudd shotgun in hand and a war of semantics between bugs and daffy with bugs winning every time only in cartoons thankfully can we see someone getting shotgun blasted in the head five times and keep going
<START> read this br br boyz 'n the hood is a scene by scene complete rip off of this movie br br two friends in the hood one's focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete the friend who's an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed the athlete just happens to be washington from 'welcome back br br it makes me mad that people don't know this it blows my mind everytime i go into a video store and boyz 'n the hood is in the 'drama' section while cooley high is in 'comedy' it's an embarrassing disgrace this movie is both funnier and more dramatic than john singleton's rip off at least singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to cooley high but no he never said a word boys 2 men however named their hit record after this film
<START> id just like to say that the film was good and touching the film explains to you the real meaning of being saved or born again and is very well set out the acting was quite good but could do with some improvements the story board is catchy and when my church had youth service and we watched it 8 people gave there life to christ id just like to say too anyone who is reading this give your life to christ and repent from your sin please visit www com thank you andrew br br the word of god will not turn void so get saved and repent from your sin
<START> this was not a good movie why do you people keep saying that there is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then bam vampires why why are there vampires where did they come from also what the hell there are all of these super human vampires but george clooney and three other random guys dominate all of them quickly too it's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle there was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies the next thing you know clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by cheech and leaves the family less homeless in the middle of mexico end of story literally oh and the strip club was an aztec temple which is funny because that would have to be southern mexico not the border why are you people lying and telling people this is a good movie do not rent buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house you will wish you had that time of your life back
<START> although i am very familiar with poet dylan thomas i know nothing of his life whatever his life and specifically his marriage involved i would imagine that the edge of love based on the novel manipulates things a bit but unless you are a historian or a poet who cares br br the movie is less about thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life one is his wife and the other is vera who was his first love one romantic night on the beach as youths is something that both have tried to put behind them but cannot now grown up they are good friends i forgot to mention that this is set during the war vera becomes engaged to captain will killing who he gets her pregnant and leaves for war while he is away vera starts to fall for thomas again and has fallen out of love with him she is also carrying another man's child things get even more emotionally complex when capt returns br br as you can see it is a very soap operatic plot and it takes shape in a fairy drab slow manner with perhaps one too many sequences of sappy dialogue but all is not lost yet for a non hollywood production i think that the edge of love is about as stylish a picture as one can get it is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90 of contemporary romances hollywood production or not some of it has to do with being set during the war which sets up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial a bit like atonement this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent to joe wright's oscar nominee but it is in far greater need for stable pacing and progression things are okay at the start and finish but the middle section is where your attention span may be tested unless you are deeply and profoundly rooted in the story br br i doubt if the edge of love will have that kind of an effect on the viewer but is a good film to check it might even make a good date night movie considering it is so much smarter than the chick flicks that boyfriends are forced to endure today
<START> wow i thought eskimo was the most awful and embarrassing first sex movie ever but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete in this case the well known german film producer was successful in producing even worse crap is stupid not believable and predictable and above all not funny it's almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany and i'm afraid also austria br br tobias 19 looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be 15 and his character is too dumb to be true tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn't know anything about sex but that doesn't help seems to be made by someone who watched al bundy and took him too seriously br br the best actors in the movie are sissi and stefan who play semi liberal parents and are stand up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting still their performances are the best' and in comparison br br a complete failure
<START> seven pioneer kids strive independently across many miles of indian territory and harsh weather to reach oregon br br according to history who traveled by themselves through long distances of land such as with the were manipulated and exploited by being abused and sold into slavery but these kids are pretty tough and they try their best to prevail in accomplishing their goal of making a homestead out west film is a little too syrupy at times but ok for fans of 'the and 'little house on the br br dean smith gives a cool performance as
<START> the stark cold landscape of big sky country with its majestic snow capped mountains juxtaposed to barren plains is put to poetic use here in this lynchian fable slide picture show about death and melancholy from the young and talented polish brothers who previously treated indie movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating twin falls idaho a film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be siamese twins a little orphan boy is dying and a town is about to flooded in the name of progress in the form a damn and power plant with its eerily pleasing music score minimalist dialogue and character development and uncanny fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels the polish brothers put their focus on what every good film artist knows a film should be about the moving pictures the images the scenes paintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid this is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep the fact that all of this was done on a shoe string budget of less than two million dollars puts hollywood with their bloated film costs and hollow movies to shame and indicates something grand to come from the polish brothers in the future
<START> only one word can describe mr magoo slapstick unfortunately this isn't no airplane looks can decieve and that's exactly what mr magoo does based on the old cartoon leslie nielson plays magoo a bumbling near blind man stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves now he must hunt them down using blindness basically and that's all this film plays off the blindness of mr magoo now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this but pretty much it's just one of those droopy dumb grin on your face because you're too ashamed to admit you payed to see this films br br but mr magoo isn't as bad as it's hacked up to be it's at least got some funny jokes and it's good wholesome fun for the whole family nielson tried to make a naked gun for families in magoo but it's no where near as good as that so see it once you might hate it you might love it whatever i personally didn't hate it but i sure didn't like it or even rate it okay 2 5 stars for mr magoo br br john ulmer
<START> watching this movie you just have to ask what were they thinking there are so many noticeably bad parts of this movie you might get the feel that its intentionally poor as some sort of joke br br i think the worst part about the film is the directing there are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematic elements in this movie that are laughably bad the funniest example of this would be in the beginning where the party guests are receiving their invitations by email the same camera angle is used for each shot which last an awkward 2 seconds a piece and the same computer screen with the same desktop window program etc appear it even looks like the thing is shot on the same set each time the whole sequence was also completely silent with no music or sound effects overall it was a poor way to convey the idea that an email was being sent all over town br br if you listen closely you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie sound tracks this is no surprise most songs including the one that opens the movie are in fact slight alterations of scores from other movies see if you can guess which ones also i noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra it sounds like its been written and played through a low end midi keyboard if you are familiar with the scum adventure games the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the engine br br everything else about the movie just plain sucks the acting is terrible the script is derivative ferris there is no joke in the movie remotely funny unless you see the whole film as one big joke being played on a paying audience don't rent this don't even watch it when it's rerun on comedy central just forget this it's terrible
<START> return to me is a movie you will want to own it is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages the story though seemingly impossible aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart david duchovny and minnie driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to be lovers who meet by chance but the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial carol o'connor as minnie driver's grandfather is authentic in every scene bonnie hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines minnie as a is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with james belushi as her husband classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times
<START> we don't know why this extraordinary film was never made available officially on dvd anthony quinn's performance alone makes this a must see there are relatively few films in which an actor identifies so profoundly with his character a phenomenon always unique for us moviegoers br br but quinn's powerful portrayal of an innocent romanian literally dragged out of his house and everyday life by forces he cannot comprehend is only part of what makes this film great the script is based on a book published in paris by a romanian priest who fled the communist take over of his country and the film succeeds to go deep into a little known area of east european history told as a succession of kafka esquire twists of fate the misadventures of moritz told openly and honestly without any of the political correctness currently so precious in hollywood are in fact a eulogy for the lost innocence of the romanian people it is devilishly ironic that this eulogy is signed by a french director working with the american money of an italian producer and overseeing a multinational cast fronted by an extraordinary mexican born thespian br br i've seen mentions of of this film in various asian internet stores and i was fortunate to take possession of a digital recording of this film broadcast on the british version of tcm but it's a shame that the 25th hour isn't anywhere on the future dvd release map of mgm studios
