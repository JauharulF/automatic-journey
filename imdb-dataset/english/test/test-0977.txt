<START> truly flatulent script and i was very disappointed with marc singer for agreeing to be in it br br i actually walked out of the theater about 15 20 minutes into it and demanded my money back i have actually walked out of a movie only 3 times in my life i am 43 years old and this is the only one that made me mad enough to demand my ticket price back if i could have i would have gotten a refund on the popcorn too this was a truly lousy movie and there is no excuse br br for one thing how does someone who was raised as a pre tech barbarian learn to drive a car in california driving a car is a somewhat tricky skill and in california even i should know i live there
<START> francis ford coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of american cinema in the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance open and among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the united states has ever had i am not a historian but all the events that preceded the decade a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the american political and cultural scenes the racial struggles the emergence of the 1960s counter culture the increase of violence and death in the streets seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare be different and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film making following the parameters of war and adventure films and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life the reason of death or the ethics of war it is also a passionate work made against all odds chronicled in the 1991 documentary hearts of darkness a filmmaker's apocalypse a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the vietnam war ever to reach the screen this may not be the definite vietnam motion picture but dealing with it coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two vietnam movies made simultaneously the deer hunter and coming home or in latter ones as platoon and casualties of war before vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre as horror in jacob's ladder or comedies as good morning vietnam among the more respectable coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war
<START> frankie plays jason who is a high school student his biggest problem is his life is built on small or big lies that puts him into trouble most times however he cannot escape from his teacher and he finishes his creative writing homework just before its deadline while he is biking fast to hand his homework to the teacher he crushes into a car as he explains the situation to grumpy man giamatti in the car he gives him a lift to his school but the problem is jason leaves his homework in the car the other way of saying this is marty wolf giamatti steals it br br after a few months jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that takes him aback because the story of the movie is based on his homework he tells that to his parents but of course they don't believe him especially his father uses words which insults him jason decides to go to la and find wolf to tell his father that jason is not a liar when wolf refuses it jason takes action and ruins his life br br this is the short story of the big fat liar well as a kids movie it might be a light hearted one but there are some errors that even could would ask if that is possible such as having such a small amount of money and going to la with a friend to sort the problem out having access to this cinema producer's highly protected house and office setting up a telecommunications system overnight does it seem believable it does not well this is a kids movie but kids are not that gullible br br big fat liar offers some little pleasure to its target audience unfortunately i am not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie out of
<START> first of all i'd like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind it is the best out of all the excellent muppet movies and every other movie out there so boo ya for jim henson br br this movie is the first of all the muppet movies and the best boo ya it's about a frog kermit who tries to make to hollywood along with the awesome friends he meets on the way comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are bound to become classics including the rainbow connection br br in conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest thing ever if you havn't already seen it then get off your computer and get you to your nearest video store if they don't have the muppet movie i'd sue them big time
<START> reba sucks it sucks hard it's about this awful country singer attempting comedy they might as well call this show generic because that's what it is it's dumb and generic reba you're not funny and i'm glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck and so does brock barbra jean the red headed teenager that jockey guy and the 12 year old who got knocked up you all suck and none of you are funny oh and i heard a rumor that reba is actually a gay devil who idolizes hitler and tortures animals and she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her music in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves but it was just a rumor anyway this is the worst show ever reba is gay i do not like her i think the office is better than this show and this show sucks
<START> this film is a tapestry a series of portraits of rom communities woven together by music it's very much a musician's film because of the paucity of spoken dialogue and what dialogue there is is not important to the structure of the narrative some might expect a national geographic tale of customs dress and music or a plot line orbiting a few central characters don't look for that here br br this is because it paints a portrait of a family of peoples rather than telling a story of individuals the plot is the story through space india to andalucia and or time we cannot tell of a people there is no need of narration you get a sense of a joyous people strongly linked in small communities where social interaction is very important and a great sense of sadness in parts at their rejection by society at large br br so it's a paean to rom culture very beautifully shot with a wide spectrum of rom music and a sting in the tail which is the oppression these people have faced and still face
<START> this movie is a definitive 5 i finally caught it on hbo the other night i remember when it came out in theatres telling a friend that it would never be a hit because americans didn't want movies about history especially movies that were more about ideas than action i don't know if that was the reason didn't do well but now having finally seen it i can add a few observations of my own br br first while dwight schultz has been fine in star trek and the a team as the lead in this movie he is off putting i kept expecting him to shout out jon lovitz like i am act ing he phrasing and tone of voice sounded like he was trying very had to be an act or on a stage where he had to emphasize strangely various words and phrases br br second i enjoyed the sly positioning of paul newman's character as a manipulator who at every turn strives to herd these cats the scientists along to get to his goal br br third there was some discussion of the moral implications of creating the a bomb and whether the us should use it probably not enough of this or as in depth as warranted br br finally there seemed to be an awful lot of twists thrown in for dramatic effect i don't know how much of the events in this movie are true to life but things like having the test bomb slip in its chains or having a lab accident caused by a spilled coffee cup and a scientist killed as a result were stretching the bounds of believability maybe that stuff or events that were similar really happened but it sure felt like various scenes were added solely for dramatic effect which undermined the whole tone and purpose of the movie br br was ok i need to read more about the actual events to know if it was over the top or just mostly accurate
<START> riggs and are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated the story line is just awful i mean really south african diplomats smuggling the mythical into the u s it's just painful and the accents are absolutely abysmal can no one get an afrikaans south african accent right or will we forever hear the british or americans making them sound like drunken hollanders the only guy who got the afrikaans accent right was tim robbins in catch a fire another thing about this movie that i disliked was when danny glover so artlessly describes an afrikaans accent as being shitty i mean what a slap in the face to the afrikaans there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit i mean mel gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their p a type don't waste your time watching this rubbish non researched film if you want to see a film that doesn't completely insult a cultural group then rent die hard 2
<START> threadbare horror outing has an innocent teen meg tilly appealing as always attempting to get in good with the popular clique at school despite the fact they seem to hate her outright and letting herself be subjected to their sorority like initiation spending the night in a creepy mausoleum despite the complete absence of originality this low budget thriller manages to come up with some decent special effects and has several good performances particularly by robin evans oozing campy viciousness as the leader of the girls the script isn't razor sharp but it has enough quirks to make the proceedings somewhat bearable from
<START> if you are one of those people that think lucio fulci is all about gore guts and zombies you have to watch this and the psychic too for that matter even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence and a unsettling subject matter it's not the main thing here this is a truly impressive story and character driven murder mystery that might well be the director's masterpiece here he proves that he's a real craftsman creating a memorable disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece filled with creepy catholic imagery and interesting social commentary it also has a great cast including the gorgeous barbara bouchet as well as tomas millan from beatrice and irene pappas in a small but important role still it is brazilian actress florinda bolkan who also stared in fulci's bizarre lizard in a woman's skin who steals the scene in the role of giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her superstitions and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking the second star of the movie is sergio cinematography who along with the melancholic morricone esquire score by riz ortolani help bringing the secluded italian village with a dark secret setting to life i have to admit thought that the dummy head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off but nonetheless this is a definite italian horror classic a moving sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius 10 10 for me if you liked this one i recommend watching alfred alice sweet alice as they are somewhat similar and are both underrated gems
<START> this may be all you need to know in order to decide whether you want to see this br br the movie is bad really really bad and sometimes it seems to be aware of that and make fun of how bad it is it aligns cliche after cliche and even manages to grow worse as it goes along with some moments that are bad enough to be hilariously funny br br if you can laugh about really poor quality in script writing and production values you might enjoy it otherwise prepare for some serious brain damage br br 3 10

<START> it's hard for me to explain this show to my grown friends i have a bunch of daisy's in the back yard which i lovingly call my chuckle patch my friends laugh at me and look at me like i have 2 heads it would be great to see this series on dvd for us folks who remember it fondly with our other childhood memories or to show our friends that there really was a chuckle patch where kids tv today is compiled of violent cartoons characters who do magic or a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea the magic garden was real in the respect that it taught us good values br br i will hold fond memories of carole and paula and the chuckle patch
<START> showtime is a mess but it's an entertaining mess the plot is forgettable the satire is lightweight and the action sequences though well staged aren't that exciting but i laughed a lot credit goes to the inspired pairing of de niro and murphy they have great chemistry murphy delivers the one liners de niro cracks us up with a look or grimace this movie will get a rush hour like reception from the critics don't listen to them if you're a fan of de niro or murphy you're going to enjoy this movie
