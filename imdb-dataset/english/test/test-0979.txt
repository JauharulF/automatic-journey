<START> i'm glad cage changed his name from and got this part on his own light hearted no deep thought needed but a cute piece about opposites attracting though her parents are still hippies captures the voice of the early 80's the whine of the valley and the funk of the other side one can see the beginning of cage's talent
<START> this movie is ridiculous it's attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it's a comedy truly is bad cinematography you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there's a few jokes here and there going on but either way they're all inside jokes amongst themselves this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad it really is a very pointless movie their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway unless you want to be bored out of your ass i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie
<START> ok the very idea is ludicrous br br 1 kids don't own planes 2 kids don't race planes with 3 it made the air force look like total idiots 4 the kids father would not jeopardize his entire career to allow his boy to joyride with him 5 neither would a reserve colonel br br the sequels i am sure were worse than this tripe the soundtrack is about the only redeeming quality of this waste of celluloid i am sorry but i just don't understand why in the world anyone would write direct and produce such junk the iranian air force is lucky to a couple parts for an ageing f 14 and this kid wrangles not 1 but 2 fully loaded and fueled f 16s gimme a break
<START> anatomie was a german made movie and subtitled it was also overlong and boring if it was supposed to be a horror movie it failed miserably for me the actors went through their paces looking more like they wanted to be some where else the film work was ok but more attention should have been applied to the awful banal script i paid nothing to see the video and i still feel cheated go read a book and save your money
<START> directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz a young mother selma lidz andie macdowell is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid john is a little lacking in the emotions department unhappy with the new home situation their sensitive son steven nathan watt decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny michael richards and melvin lou until his mom is well steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits he even decides he wants to change his name to franz set in the early 60's this drama is a bit comedic change that to zany not being a macdowell fan unstrung heroes assures my attitude albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste
<START> for all intents and purposes showtime was the worst movie i have ever seen br br why because having deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie i had also made the mistake of watching 48 hours and beverly hills cop recently before seeing showtime and for some strange reason thought eddie murphy was still funny well he's not in fact it almost seems like he has been neutered as i watched this movie i was in amazement that deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too no chemistry between him and murphy whatsoever horrible writing horrible jokes a movie that you think is supposed to be good can't get much worse than this not too long after sitting through the wretch that was showtime i happened to watch national security starring martin lawrence the movie had its funny parts but wasn't that great but still it was 20 times better than showtime please if your a deniro fan do not watch this movie
<START> in complete contrast to the previous correspondent here i thought munich as it was billed when shown with english subtitles here in london at the german film festival in november 2007 was very funny very well acted and excellently scripted br br it's quite audacious to design a 100 minute film that consists exclusively and relentlessly of talking heads but i think ralf succeeded with wit and Ã©lan no standard filmic devices of say following a character's soul baring pronouncement with some meditative minor seventh chord music and long shot nature cutaways but when someone said something that revealed their souls well we were hustled on by the man with the timer for yet another superficial introduction which is of course the point the hurtling superficiality of thirtysomething urbanites where everything is down to a quick question and answer br br maybe most films are so clichÃ©d and stupid that we english are ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and cinema but i can promise you that at the screening tonight cinema sun 25 nov 2007 the full audience with laughter most of the way through so i wasn't the only one guffawing br br my girlfriend who speaks german and has lived in munich thought it was hilarious i who don't speak german and have not been to munich i think thought it was hilarious i'd recommend munich to anyone especially couples looking for a smart witty original wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the bewilderment of the generation who feel they've missed out on the happy ever after stuff first time round br br nb in the english subtitled showing in london the subtitles which were very good were shown completely underneath the slightly reduced picture not inside it i thought this was a good thing
<START> what to say about a movie like rock star a lot actually this is the type of movie that is almost tailer made for the critics to slam it is also a movie i as a major hard rock fan enjoyed no loved actually while all the while being very consciously aware of its many flaws and that the movie while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic oh well br br i loved this movie and would see it again and again but i know that's purely based on my own personal tastes rock star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia it was a great time for metal heads and it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that long forgot by many non rock fans time effectively as i think that rock star has done that is one of the film's strengths the concert footage you will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that as far as setting the atmosphere rock star gets a 10 of 10 it also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment if you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past then this is the movie for you it is also the reason why i loved this movie so br br but it isn't a great movie i understand that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally i'd probably have to be a bit hard on this one the problem with rock star is the character development br br what is wrong with the character development is this there isn't any none the movie has certain scenes few and far between but they are there that do touch on greatness warning brief scene spoilers 3 examples 1 when izzy makes his debut on stage including the fall he takes br br 2 the first after show party with emily anniston and izzy br br 3 a little in the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissed fired the whole business as usual tone sets the stage for what's to come it's played very effectively br br but the problem is nothing ever does come there is little to no character development of anyone in this movie peoples' persona's are merely touched on but never fully explored i don't think that's the fault of the actors actresses particularly anniston who tries hard they just are not given much to work with it's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the formula feel into true movie depth rock star was so sugarcoated at times including towards the end it was almost ridiculous and though those scenes i mentioned were outstanding and very believable sadly much else in the movie wasn't br br another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and i agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about anything why does izzy leave at the end because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs it tests the limits of believability and frankly the end was just corny made no sense and had no reality to it at all br br watching this it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said ok this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc by the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true it's just another thickly formulated love story and you wonder why so much detail is left out br br i hope i'm not being to hard on rock star because i truly loved it but not for the right reasons i would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame instead i loved it for it's 80's period feel the clothes the hair the lights the life although many others loved it to i suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan like i did or some who play i'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good well told movie instead of a clichÃ© i think one of the problems was the length i myself hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer if a movie is done really right the length is not even felt there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was that's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie br br so to wind down this is a movie you can greatly get into but not a great movie see it for fun see it for entertainment see it to go back to that great great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life it was life and for those non rock fans see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us
<START> this movie should have easily qualified as a film br br that best promotes human understanding among people br br it may be rather annoying to even try to comprehend that a young jewish southern girl could would give shelter to an escaped german prisoner of war br br kristy depicts an amazing portrait of the unhappy young girl thirsting for acceptance and love michael constantine gave a remarkable performance as her difficult father and esther rolle as the maid ruth gave a superb emmy winning performance as an understanding maid caught up with these events br br bruce davison portrays the german who is supposedly not guilty of nazi atrocities this is how his role appears he has escaped but he joined the german army and he might have been a member of the hitler youth movement br br the action takes place in 1944 georgia in a rural area the townspeople are filled with prejudice even the fbi inspector acts as if he would like to get something on the jews notice the opposite interpretation that as is in bed davison is hunted down and ultimately shot it is interesting to see that society views as a traitor for harboring an escaped prisoner of war the film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter outburst at his daughter at the end is some acting as the mother barbara barrie is given little to do it was annoying that she is stereotyped as the typical jewish mother with that loud shade of lipstick on her lips br br memorably done and well worth viewing
<START> what a fine film unfortunately being 1947 the movie script couldn't have followed the book from which it was adapted but the murder of a homosexual would have been too hot to handle in that era br br i thought all of the performances were outstanding as well as the script direction brilliant black and white cinematography music and film noir atmosphere br br i do understand that in 1947 the film couldn't portray racism against blacks or prejudice against homosexuals robert young's account of prejudice against his grandfather who was irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago was pretty lame but the times dictated that the film avoid a further examination of racism br br i do have one observation and one question to ask the viewer 1 did you notice that robert young didn't aim his gun when he shot and killed robert ryan who was running fast in the dark and young shot from an upper story window into the dark without aiming 2 if robert young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 the film was made in 1947 and young was 40 years old the time line would not be logical if the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago then the time frame would be realistic
<START> this was charlie chaplin's first all talking film yes there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film modern times but it was still essentially a silent film so it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear chaplin speak on film br br the movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation while i enjoyed the film i was not nearly as impressed by this as chaplin's other full length films of the mid 20s and 30s that's because i really felt annoyed by some of chaplin's dopey over acting when he played especially when he was giving his speeches the silly pseudo dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used such as the three stooges plus playing a funny hitler is hard for me to take br br however when chaplin played the jewish barber he wasn't especially funny he really wasn't intended to be a funny character but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency this film should not be remembered as a comedy especially since it doesn't really excel there but for its excellent acting and humanity the final speech by the barber impersonating is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes watch the film for this reason alone
<START> this movie has everything going for it fully developed characters a realistic portrayal of working washington bathed in warmth and humor that is uniquely albert brooks the dumbing down of network news is even more of an issue now than it was in 1987 remember this was pre cable so satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals and it all moves along with lightning speed such a true to life depiction of friendships that teeter toward romance see if you can spot john cusack as the angry messenger and do you recognize peter from real life broadcast news finally if you're from dc see if you agree with holly hunter's directions to cab drivers
<START> this show was incredible i've seen all three and this is the best this movie has suspense a bit of romance stunts that will blow your mind go bobbie great characters and amazing locations where was this filmed will there be more i really liked the story line with her brother looking forward to chameleon 4 and to see how the world is saved yet again
<START> a man kicks a dog 2' in the air br br a woman kicks a cow out of her bed br br a man kicks a violin down the sidewalk br br a woman sucks on a statue's toe for 15 seconds br br a man kicks a blind man in the stomach br br jesus rapes a young girl br br there you have it i just saved you an hour of your life surely there are those to whom this shocking vanguard of cinematic expression would appeal but i found it no different from the puerile disconnected videos i used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade except we never had a real cow br br having heard endless sermons from beard stroking art of how this is such an important film i thought it would be worth my time make no mistake this is crap if i hear one more person call buÃ±uel the father of cinematic surrealism i think i'm going to punch someone if anything he issued a major step backward from the surrealist beginnings pioneered by his seniors fritz lang metropolis f w murnau faust and robert caligari 10 years earlier this made a joke out of the whole thing as if buÃ±uel didn't have the confidence to truly embrace the art sans sarcasm sans it would take buÃ±uel another 40 years before he would refine his style into something admirable skip the early stuff and hop straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work br br i'm sure he would agree in 1977 buÃ±uel himself stated that he would happily burn all the prints of his old movies in this case i would be happy to pour the lighter fluid
<START> a gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on le for a week's holiday stories intertwine characters fight make friends deceive each other have sex br br blanc has gathered together a stellar cast for his adaptation of connolly's book but to little avail what should be hilarious is instead at turns tedious and irritating all the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both and in the end despite the farcical nature of things this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them br br credit to the always wonderful rampling plus bouquet and viard but that's it and looks like he's rather overdone the nips and if you ask me
