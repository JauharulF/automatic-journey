<START> for a while when i was in between jobs i had a habit of watching all the late night talk shows for a while i had a good selection conan leno letterman ferguson kimmel br br until i reached the 1 30 a m time slot the time between conan and x files on scifi and the only show on at that time was and curiously still is carson daly br br his show intrigued me at first youngish casually dressed and with the hip pedigree of an mtv host i thought carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night i couldn't have been more wrong br br he has no comedic timing his jokes are plainly unfunny and his monologue a painful affair of self conscious babbling i began to think he simply wasn't capable of delivering comedy and i am right he isn't but it became obvious over time that the writers on the show must have had it in for him the writing was idiotic and much too overreaching and the skits screamingly bad and towards the end of the show being in studio the writers had carson drinking alcohol on the set with gusto on every show an oblivious carson grinning from emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek as he sloshed his way through interviews br br zero interview skills none he tries to be friendly chatty but ends up being boorish and rude he talks too much he cuts off his guests he asks them rude or embarrassing questions if he can find a question to ask them at all and as someone had already pointed out the guests literally stare at him or squirm in their seats clearly uncomfortable br br now the show has left the studio and looks as though it were shot on one handy cam even still carson refuses to take the hint from nbc at one point carson didn't even get a camera man he had to film himself for an episode wake up carson that handwriting is all over the wall br br i see the show is produced by carson i can only imagine that is the reason it is still on the air he pays for it himself
<START> i recently was lucky enough to see the kite runner in a small theater surrounded by seasoned movie goers who knew how to enjoy a masterpiece of such sophistication with all the controversy surrounding this film's central scene these days i was expecting a piece both crude and violent but the way mr forster handled the delicate subject was touching and really deeply moving even though the film's credits indicated china as the main location for the shoot i could have sworn i was seeing kabul throughout the scenes which are meant to be taking place in afghanistan the acting by non professionals as well as professional actors is excellent and the casting is magnificent so this is a movie i would see again and again because though it is undeniably sad in its subject the masterful way it has been made awakens a whole new hope in modern cinema
<START> with all of its technical flash the 1993 stalingrad movie is very disappointing before watching it i had read non fiction accounts of the stalingrad campaign and had seen a lot of documentary footage and photographs of the actual battle and its participants i don't think that any movie can really succeed in depicting the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred but i still wanted to see what a relatively recent german movie production would be like while there are a few good elements of this movie overall it is a failure to me the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms and also some very contrived and clichÃ©d elements most glaringly in some encounters between a german officer and a soviet woman br br also there are some ideological elements in the movie which result in very distorted perceptions including what amounts to a caricature of a german chaplain some overblown class warfare messages and problematic depictions of good vs bad germans certainly the german armed forces of world war ii included men who were able to maintain some decency throughout the war and others who did very bad things but the attempts in the movie to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish i give stalingrad credit in the sense that it doesn't completely portray german troops in the simple demonic quality which is the stereotype that many people now have yet the movie includes stereotypes of its own such as an almost too good to be true infantryman who has attitudes more akin to the 1990's than the 1940's and two completely evil infantrymen and a rear echelon officer br br some recent movies such as stalingrad and saving private ryan are frequently praised for their authenticity in depicting graphic scenes of combat yet these same movies are deeply flawed and distorted in their depictions of the attitudes values and behaviors of 1940's soldiers and civilians stalingrad and s p r have major and minor characters who lack the stoicism that was common among regular people during the world war ii period certainly soldiers throughout history have been notorious for their frequent grumbling and occasional cynicism yet the self absorbed talky and touchy feely characters in both of these movies are something else and are much more prevalent in our world of today than they were in the 1940's while many people these days like to denigrate war movies from the 40's and 50's which present more patriotic messages and aren't as graphic about combat many of those earlier movies such as battleground are much more accurate in their depictions of typical soldiers' attitudes and they are often successful in showing the horrible effects of war in more indirect ways br br one well done part of stalingrad is a battle between german infantry and soviet tanks which does a reasonable job of capturing some of the horror and confusion in such combat br br stalingrad does a poor job though of showing the common look of the frontline soldier part of this might be due to the difficulty in finding thin haggard looking extras in our pampered and well fed america and western europe of today also too many of the german troops in the movie don't wear their uniforms and equipment properly and don't display the professional bearing that was common in the german wehrmacht even during the years of german defeat if you want to get a good idea of how the actual german troops looked i recommend the following documentaries which contain footage of the stalingrad campaign the world at war war of the century and russia's war also the books operation barbarossa in photographs by paul carell stalingrad by geoffrey and stalingrad by paul carell contain a great many helpful photos books written about the battle by antony and william craig are recommended also and the latter one is especially good about the common soldiers and civilians on both sides br br relatively recent movies which in my opinion are much better than stalingrad and saving private ryan in depicting attitudes and characters of persons during world war ii and the general feel look horror and grittiness of that war are der untergang the downfall and the winter war while a bridge too far and the longest day cover events on the western front rather than in the east they are also excellent war movies and stick very close to factual accounts the latter two movies lack some of the grit that is more prevalent in more recent films but they compensate for that lack with their other strengths including truthfulness
<START> down at the movie gallery i saw a flick i just had to see it looked like a fun low budget horror action western that i could get into yeah i knew it would suck but i rented it anyway hoping for laughs only a few laughs were to be found this was an extremely stupid movie it begins with a bounty hunter our protagonist who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film he looks acts like he could take on chuck norris but he can't his dialogue sucks too anyway he goes into a village shoots some zombies you could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes 3 5 minutes to reload or watch some zombies at least the zombies look cool so anyway some people get shot some zombies die and in the end everyone is dead except our main character who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people
<START> what a script what a story what a mess
<START> this is the second addition to frank personally produced trilogy of oz films it's essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures although i consider it preferable to the others because it's shorter as in the other films there are performers in animal costumes an adult woman pretends to be a boy and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera work is static this time at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes and the boy played by a woman is made a king br br most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning fairies are represented by multiple exposure photography and there's a man in the moon that looks just like those made by georges years before most famously in voyage dans la 1902 mÃ©liÃ¨s' imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this trifling oz series
<START> admittedly you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it sci fi and thats enough to get me interested so if you are like that black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it the best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launch br br the movie plays like the naked gun series spoofing cop dramas with bad clichÃ©s and bad acting unfortunately i don't think they meant to be funny the actors really are made of cardboard the dialog really does suck so well just have to laugh at them and not with them br br on a side note it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space half on earth and doesn't mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events i really do ache for more realistic drama based on our space endeavors
<START> i will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes it the best br br this is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst film tarantino has ever done the only good thing in this movie was the performance of mr waltz br br so i was really disappointed and seeing this movie on place 40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this that leaves me with my mouth opened now for more details go and read hated it reviews br br one thing i hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of dumb people spoiler ahead now i know tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictitious plots but come on adolf hitler and 200 top nazis officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied france and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings where also an american african walks around freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire these 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 heroes to slay hitler at point blank with around 100 rounds very dumb at least challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time go watch valkyrie besides mike myers impersonation of a british general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing hitler just picture that br br what ruined it further is that the only smart and powerful character which nailed everyone in the movie with his psychological and mind bending interrogations ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie br br after watching the movie i was sympathizing with nazis who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our basterds imagine that br br my recommendations if you have insomnia 2hrs 33 min to waste or you want to give your mind a break go watch this movie
<START> i have recently watched this film and have decided to comment on it br br the best way to watch this film is to not expect what you have seen in the past by miyazaki miyazaki is well known for his work on on spirited away and howl's moving castle well for western viewers anyway both of them films were kind of similar to each other but at the same time completely different however is a whole different type of story and animation all together br br the story follows a fish that has the face a girl after runs away from her home at the bottom of the sea she find a whole new world she never knew was out there and new trouble as well when she almost caught by a fishing boat she was rescued by a five year old boy known as br br the story then follows the two of them and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish can really stay with forever br br i feel the movie was inspired by the little mermaid and at the same time similar to no totoro br br the movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie but the characters a fish and a little boy so how much are you expecting to learn about them the film is set over about what seems to be 3 days i think this is why the movie is so short br br i really enjoyed watching this movie and i hope you all enjoy this movie as well
<START> not even the beatles could write songs everyone liked and although walter hill is no mop top he's second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies the nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film the emergence of the rapper turned movie star was in full swing the acting took a back seat to each man's overpowering regional accent and transparent acting this was one of the many ice t movies i saw as a kid and loved only to watch them later and cringe bill paxton and william sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications i hand it to walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location but i fault everyone involved for turning out lame o performances ice t and cube must have been red hot at this time and while i've enjoyed both their careers as rappers in my opinion they fell flat in this movie it's about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief now this is a movie its not a documentary so i wont waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie but there were many and they led nowhere i got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was of confused and just playing things off the cuff there are two things i still enjoy about it one involves a scene with a needle and the other is huge 45 pistol bottom line this movie is like domino's pizza yeah ill eat it if i'm hungry and i don't feel like cooking but i'm well aware it tastes like crap 3 stars meh
<START> i feel the heat i feel your beat something ain't right theme song written by b j cook from david foster's old band and wife she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc's airwaves oh night heat what a program well written well acted and totally classic crime and a good team and a dash of humour at the end i'd like to think this is really what detectives do did was a real favourite on a canadian tip i learned every canadian actor's name and style from guest spots done on night heat everyone passed through the night heat set and like law order it was story driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama
<START> this was made in that beloved age known as the 80s and shot in my hometown of new york city actually this has become one of my favorite b sci fi movies oh sure it really stinks to high hell but there's so much to make fun of laugh and enjoy that it becomes more tolerable after every viewing br br such as br br try to find the similarities between this and well ok there is nothing similarly bad as this well except castle of br br sock puppets can be dangerous to your health br br create by describing through voice over rather than showing any imagery br br have leading villainess valeria played wonderfully by deliver some of the most riveting lines ever br br lots of men and women in post apocalyptic fashion aka leather bikinis loin cloths and dead animal fur br br do be horrified by the end br br i'm off to have a salad
<START> the title is a reference to the destruction of the remnants of a harvest like rice husks by farmers who burn them creating fires on the plains this is a bleak tale of the destruction of the japanese soldier br br the story is set in the closing days of the philippines campaign as a soldier with tb who returns from a hospital because since he can walk they have no room for him his superior officers don't want him around since he's really too sick to work or fight abused by his officer he's sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or kill himself they still won't take him and he's soon left to wander across the war ravaged landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and man's inhumanity to man at every turn br br billed as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war this is also a very funny movie this isn't to say its not horrifying it is at times but its also darkly comic how could it not be here is a film where madness and insanity run rampant people are constantly trying to hustle tobacco leaves for food trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes trying to remain a japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by marching constantly but never getting anywhere and you can't help but laugh to be sure things go darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism maybe literally and figuratively the only way to survive but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny about the human comedy br br hailed as a great anti war film its stark photographic style makes clear the insanity of war even as it dazzles our eye with its beauty here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian set amid fields forests and trees that would otherwise be and to some extent still are quite beautiful its a jarring sensation br br what intriguing is that i read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of christianity the director removed all over the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it as to show that life stinks war stinks worse and that there is ultimately no hope br br intellectually i admire the film emotionally i don't part of it is a strident downbeat score which for me over accentuates what we are seeing on the screen its almost gilding the lily since the imagery is so strong it doesn't really need to have the music force you into feeling one way or another br br is it a great film thats for you to decide for certain its unlike any other war film bloody horrific and real in ways that big budgeted films claim to be but never are this is not for those adverse to blood and gore since its here in spades br br definitely worth a look
<START> i always liked this movie i have seen it so many times but i always enjoyed it the story is interesting and special but the only thing i have to disagree with is that i don't think max lived in a romanian monastery or what was that p they don't look that way in romania anyway back to the story played pretty well but as someone said before me his english needs to improve br br and there were some funny moments and some tragical sad parts too it worths being seen i thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love i recommended to you all it's not the best movie ever but it was nice
