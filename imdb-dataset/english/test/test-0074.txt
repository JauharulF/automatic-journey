<START> i rented this movie because i noticed the cover in the video rental store i saw nolte connely madsen 40's time setting and thought hmm can't be too bad unfortunately after watching it my impression was not too good br br its kind of a chinatown ripoff but the worst part is that other than nolte the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time but its a decent movie to see once i guess and melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance
<START> cooley high is one of my favorite movies ever i think i saw this movie years ago on late night tv with my mother when i was little and i thought it was so funny this movie was also referred to as a black american graffiti glynn turman is wonderful as preach and lawrence hilton jacobs is great as friend there are some other great characters in it as well and this movie has a lot of humor packed into it from the beginning of the movie where goes to home to get ready for school to the sad ending of funeral this movie is one that will get you laughing all the way there are a lot of scenes in this film that i like a lot the scene where another one of preach and friends go to the zoo with them and gets the gorilla's feces thrown on his shirt very gross but funny as well the first scene in the street corner cafeteria the quarter party at this girl's house which became a disaster due to a fight and some others are wonderful to watch this movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album which is packed with a lot of wonderful motown hits and artists from the early 60s only 6 songs on the soundtrack were done in '75 while the rest were from the '60s the movie is mainly about two friends who dream about getting away from their impoverished and rough neighborhood after high school but their futures seem almost out of reach due to their innocent joy ride in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for and relationship with his girlfriend brenda played by cynthia davis almost gets put in jeopardy go out and rent or buy this movie and be ready for a load of comical entertainment get the soundtrack too it is a lot of fun as well
<START> spoiler warning br br we've all heard the boy who cried wolf legend but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world well it might be something like big fat liar fourteen year old jason sheperd frankie from malcolm in the middle is always lying to keep himself out of trouble one day he is pressured to write an english essay but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film maker marty wolf paul giamatti who plans to turn jason's story into a hollywood blockbuster no one believes jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school however jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to l a with his friend amanda bynes when wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story jason plans to make wolf's life a living hell b f l is no masterpiece but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you're time i wished they could've made it a bit longer though and there aren't that much pranks although they are clever enough i like the pool dye the best i might not have liked this as much as i do if it weren't for paul giamatti he is simply hilarious in this if you have 90 minutes to kill try this out you might just enjoy it
<START> a bunch of mostly obnoxious and grossly unappealing teens go to a creepy remote rundown old mortuary located nearby a cemetery to attend an anything goes all out halloween party being hosted by freaky occult obsessed oddball mimi kinkade and her vacuous boy hungry friend linnea quigley the loutish profane beer guzzling sex happy dipstick hold a sÃ©ance as a joke very bad idea 'cause the desolate old dive is naturally said to be haunted by demonic spirits of course that ill advised sÃ©ance awakens those decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits who gruesomely kill and possess a majority of the kids turning them into ugly fanged clawed boil faced murderous ghouls who wreak the usual grisly havoc throughout the duration of an especially long dark and harrowing night of pure terror br br yep this is essentially your umpteenth vigorously graphic and unrelenting wall to wall cheap shock ridden evil dead rehash replete with closed off there's no easy way out claustrophobic single self confined setting outrageously excessive splatter set pieces an incessantly pounding synthesizer score a total sense of laden grim and in your face manic careening cinematography the expected headlong rush inducing hyperactive hand held camera work smooth sinuous tracking shots crazily camera angles even the camera on a dolly doing a gracefully gliding 180 degree figure eight fortunately kevin s slick assured stylish direction keeps the extremely threadbare and derivative proceedings thundering along at a speedy clip moreover tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a certain crudely energetic and enthusiastically grotesque spooky ooga carnival funhouse atmosphere br br however steve johnson's marvelously gory and imaginative make up effects are the true star of the show bloodthirsty highlights include disgusting fat slob hal who played a similarly irritating obese a hole role in the immortal sorority babes in the slimeball bowl a rama around the same time having his tongue bitten off quigley shoving a whole tube of lipstick in one of her breasts and gouging a guy's eyes out while she's making love to him double a libidinous teen couple getting offed while doing exactly what you think in a coffin the chick has her neck snapped while the dude has his arm chopped off kinkade setting her hands on fire and in the film's single most nasty scene a mean old man has his throat slit from the inside out after eating an apple piece laced with razor blades the rock score likewise smokes and then there's kinkade's incredibly wild sexy and uninhibited demon dance a sizzling number accompanied by a flickering strobe light and startling jump cuts that kinkade choreographed herself okay so this overall doesn't amount to anything more than a completely mindless and pointless albeit quite nicely mounted and enjoyably vulgar hunk of blithely sleazy fright flick junk but if you're in the mood for entertainingly brain dead lowbrow horror scuzziness this cheerfully crass and juvenile dross does the trick just fine
<START> the early films of the dead end kids before they were re christened the bowery boys were all very entertaining and well produced films from warner brothers despite their being rather formulaic they still had excellent writing acting and hold up well over time do not confuse these with the cheap bowery boys films from monogram pictures despite the presence of huntz hall and leo gorcey these films were several notches below the earlier films in regard to quality br br the film begins with tough guy john garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship unfortunately shortly after this he's on a drunken binge and is blamed for a murder he really didn't commit the problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn't sure he didn't kill the man so he runs away and lives the life of a hobo eventually he meets up with feisty may robson and the dead end kids as well as a lady you just know will become his girlfriend given time br br where the rest of the film goes was not all that surprising but because of the quality of the film it doesn't seem to matter garfield and the kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but the of viewers
<START> art house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer chiller which ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teen sexuality and violent gore the suburbs come across about as well as they do in every piece of australian writing book or film since 1960 surprise surprise the suburbs have a dark underbelly and the plot is as contrived as any you've seen the neighbours would never know about this guy one of the filmmakers says about joel character but he was completely plausible as to what he was serial killers don't all have patches over their eyes and scars down their cheeks they look like the guy next door another trader in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in every street but the real insignificance of this film is in the fact that it's a genre film that nobody saw backed by substantial funds including some from film finance that's government this got a run at the underground film festival in melbourne and had to rely on kindness for a very short release season what is the doing funding genre flicks even if they are 'arty' and aesthetically unconventional why are these nasty movies acolytes beautiful punishment no through road being made in the first place richard co encourage their creators to believe they're giving the masses what they really want as opposed to what the culture elite in government funding think they want the truth is that these brutal and forgettable nasties earn far more critical acclaim and win far more obscure awards than they're due
<START> all y'all on the fact you'd probably neva make the cut for second string need to save it if more guys out there took their sorry to the gym for once maybe y'all have a chance well maybe take shawn woods' hook physique for a perfect example and i stress the word perfect put that in your pipe and smoke it you couldn't look better sha shawn
<START> dark waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made i had expected at least some passable entertainment because john rhys davies was involved and after seeing this movie i can honestly say i lowered my opinion of mr davies substantially br br why the acting is incredibly poor an excellent actor like davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director it was painfully obvious that mr davies was just clock watching and hoping the check would not bounce to say that he just showed up would be an understatement but at least he did show up the rest of the cast looks like they mailed it in from their respective jobs at the various los angeles restaurants where they work as waiters talk about a cast of unknowns this is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again they act as if they were auditioned while waiting at the unemployment office br br what about the special effects store bought firecrackers styrofoam a cheap rubber suit and cgi effects that look like they came from my 1980 atari game i have seen some horrible special effects used on sci fi channel movies but this stuff looked like cut and paste done at the kindergarten by child i expected mr crabs and sponge bob would show up at the end to battle the not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small gremlin like critter it would have been a good film for a leprechaun like character instead we get a gigantic hulking creature that is shown walking with stop action speeded up effects that are laughable the is in one place and then it shuffles at super speed down the hall and it is worth a few laughs just to see this
<START> everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here this is simply a run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc slasher but without the passion that graced the original br br there's nothing new in the story in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether here the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and naturally kill most of the residents in grisly fashion the makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in demons in demons 2 they're actually a lot worse you don't care about these characters at all the plot is nonexistent the music poor apart from one simon boswell song it's not scary in the least it's just not that good br br easily the worst film dario argento has been involved with and lamberto bava's also bava has a cameo in this film not a very funny one br br maybe 3 is too high a rating but at least i could watch it all and didn't think of stopping midway my advice stick to the original
<START> i was permanently scarred by this terrible film br br the main action of the movie is nothing special it seems there's a tribe of snake worshipping people in a remote mountain region of northern china where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers i suppose among some men this is enough to make a horror movie anyway occasionally chinese men would wander into the village take a fancy to the local girls seduce them and then abandon them unfortunately for the men the women had put them under a spell derived from snake venom which would make them die horribly in 100 days their swollen like a pregnant woman's with live worms and snakes if they did not return br br forget the cover of the us video this has nothing to do with vampires though there is one inept blood drinking scene the title itself is only marginally appropriate is the latin verb meaning to lie beneath and it's the root of the word succubus a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep actually it's the men who are the here br br but it's not the main action of this ludicrous film that's so objectionable it's the little side incidents i'll overlook the slaughter and butchery of an ox that's performed on screen the participants seem very experienced as though this is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life and i'm sure they really ate the animal afterwards though i resent having the act thrust in my face as entertainment br br what i wish i could overlook or had overlooked are the numerous totally extraneous shots of an unidentified man who from time to time interrupts the story by eating living animals he starts the movie by tearing apart a live snake with his teeth in the course of the movie he devours a bug a lizard a toad i had to leave the room after this and a whole mouse i stopped watching at this point and lost my appetite for days let me stress that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the movie unless it's a cynical reference to love as it's portrayed in the film a blind selfish predatory survival mechanism that tears apart the helpless but then again i'm probably just to get the vileness out of my head
<START> i am willing to tolerate almost anything in a sci fi movie but this was almost intolerable while a few of the special effects are very cool landscapes this is no rather a disjointed weird mother daughter relationship with sci fi concepts thrown in the acting wooden framing and shooting kindergarten film school and with hand to hand combat scenes funnier than any hong kong chopsocky movie this film bores the plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along narrator unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea save your love of sci fi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here
<START> i would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a movie on soviet afghan war and it is very honest and responsible picture starting from small details of uniforms and weapons up to human relations war routine and central asian landscapes it's been shot in just after the the troop withdrawal which happened in 1989 not in 1985 the italian star mr placido was just perfect in the role of major other characters looked also very natural especially always drunk club managing officer the scenario seems a bit jammed in the end but it might be an impact of the civil war in which had started right during the shooting of the film all movie team had to escape sometimes even under fire the last scene is purely type of behavior and reminded me the final phrase from one famous samurai movie we've won all battles but lost the war it could be also a metaphor of ussr collapse the great country allowing to shoot itself to the back by the small offended child
<START> the best screen performance ever by george c scott the screenplay by the irony freighted dialogue is near perfect 'just where do you train your nurses dachau ' rigg is wonderful as the rescuing angel who saves scott from doom as is the whole cast it's a hilarious and serious movie it is a movie of the period the 60's but it is not in any sense dated what it is about the chaos and irrationality of the system vs the sanity of the individual is timeless and the we heal nothing we cure nothing monologue delivered shouted actually as no one else but scott could with its references to cloning and other of modern science could literally have been written this morning br br
<START> almost 4 years after the events of 911 if asked what comes to mind about that day most people would probably comment on things such as the sight of planes crashing into and the collapse of the twin towers the scores of people being killed acts of terrorism and heroism mixed together etc everyone who was alive at the time will never forget that day yet for most of us the memories although moving are not on a personal level now comes an extraordinary film which gives everyone who did not lose a friend or a family member a chance to become involved at a personal level in just what we lost on 911 this is a film that needs to be seen
<START> a very good offering from hbo traci lords is becoming a much better dramatic actress with each effort i hope to see this attractive lady in more challenging roles in the future instead of the flighty roles she has been stuck with in the past
