<START> the main character of this sex filled drivel mel ethan hunt notes on several occasions she deserves better than this the she he refers to is ginger played by beautiful brandy davis who indeed does deserve better than this brandy deserves better than this film its lame script and perverted mel a guy who gets off at watching his dream girl have sex with another man even in virtual world seriously does not deserve her at all an a for the simulated sex scenes an f for the script
<START> as a flying and war movie buff this ranks at he bottom of my list it is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and acts like they just stepped out of a high school play the acting script direction production standards and casting are all garbage the only saving grace is some of the flying sequences if the people they portray were fictitious i might rate it a 2 but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in movies it is pretending that this is history and that the great people they are trying to be actually did this its almost as if they tried to write in as many notable ww1 personalities as possible there are many good ww1 flying films and this is not one of them
<START> big disappointment clash by night is much to talky and stagy and the dialog doesn't resonate as true coming from these characters this is melodrama at its peak the acting is truly over the top and very unreal only marilyn monroe and keith as supporting players give this film any zip wish they had more to do i'm somebody who looks at details in films two big questions 1 who is watching the baby the entire day when stanwyck and ryan are together and douglas is working then breaking up a fight in a bar with is father 2 when stanwyck is packing to leave town why is she seen packing at her brothers place where she hasn't lived for at least two years also when everyone goes to the projection room at the theatre who's taking care of the baby again such details really irritate me and cause me to give films much lower ratings what were the writers directors and everyone else connected with the film thinking said
<START> this movie is about people living at a later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are out of work comedians mainly old males well more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f ing but never there is any action just those people talking in the beginning i thought it's some cool perverted redneck stuff but after a while it got boring i mean how many versions can you think of saying f ing d k c t for sure this can be funny for half an hour maybe not 80 minutes but it was funny to watch those people trying to act i'm pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing but it does not disturb the movie it's cool like this because those individuals seem so poor f ed up crestfallen a that the style totally fits their wooden helpless reading of the texts makes quite good atmosphere i fell in love with the characters a little br br spoiler ahead later in the movie the f ers do some comedy shows rhymes about f ing with just themselves as audience and imagined applause then one gets an eviction advice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their roofs armed with some weapons then they got shoot fin sounds like action but it's not just some trashy home camera takes spoiler end br br but the movie is totally consequent in it's style and i'm pretty sure it's just what the movie maker wanted to have it's the portrait of those f k ups in an groggy home camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch but the texts about you know what the whole time get boring after a while br br pretty young director who also seems an interesting person as he played some teenager stuff in popular movies tv series but now got in more horror movies which is more his cup of tea i guess and this his first direction effort will be distributed by troma now don't know anything about a release i got this one as an advance screener from this years cannes which says for bootlegging purposes only
<START> i am shocked and amazed to find reviews short of miserable for this horrible film i rented this movie or feces whatever you wish to call it with several friends and after thirty minutes we had to stop watching just listening to the dialog left a horrible taste of sour milk in my mouth this film was about as intelligent as an ass pimple i hope i never see that bra less raggedy anne look alike julianne nicholson again it was like watching the most putrid pilot for a sitcom that will never make it to television but instead of being a quick but painful 30 minutes all i could bare this was an excruciating 90 minutes
<START> oliver stone is not one to shy away from a movie or theme for that matter he is eager to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror look on his cv for proof this movie is not an exception quite on the contrary it is another gem that unfortunately not many have seen br br as controversial movies go this is one that you should be thankful for a movie that should encourage you to think about you the people next to you the prejudices that do exist and that everyone of us has in one form or another either we like to admit it or not but it is easier to categorize people and be like ah he's yeah he must be like now i might be reading too much into it but i don't believe that i believe that oliver stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he was aiming for those things and if that's something you want to explore as a movie or within yourself than watch this film and be excited
<START> the presentation is very shabby to my notion as documentaries often are michael moore's farenheit 911 is far more convincing but has far too much media and political influence cant wait till saturday when i get to see the docudrama the game of their lives ifc goes right of center i have started a collection of ifc movies from off the internet due to out of on decade wanna see good documentaries stick to the history channel or try docudrama you cant go wrong with them my friend cant go wrong the seventies were ten years of reruns or so the old times would have you to believe disco died and it is gone forever when elvis died o yes we all did grieve
<START> one imdb reviewer calls eaten alive a passable film for the cannibal connoisseur are there such people i didn't know but if you are one of them hey have a ball the rest of you might find this tripe a bit hard to swallow pun intended even if like me you consider yourself a horror film connoisseur i have been an avid horror fan for about 15 years now although i never got around to the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago and i guess i owe my short lived interest in these groan inducing movies strangely enough to china's total disregard for copyright laws you see i bought a two disc dvd collection of all of wesley snipes' films for 20 yuan about 2 75 which turned out to include last cannibal world mountain of the cannibal god eaten alive cannibal holocaust next with nicholas cage and something called voodoo lagoon along with blade 1 3 in chinese nice br br being a second sequel i immediately got a sinking feeling when the movie opened with a cannibal in street clothes wandering around major american cities shooting unsuspecting americans with poison darts and then scrambling away at full speed having run out of ways to keep movie cannibals scary it seems that now they have made their way to the mainland later you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on a training exercise lock up your daughters br br before long the movie settles into the old missing sister routine as a young blonde woman named sheila begins her own investigation of the disappearance of her sister who looks nothing like her in any way but she's willing to spend most of the movie naked so i guess that doesn't matter it seems that after shooting one of his victims the hapless cannibal we met early in the movie not used to big city life ran into the road and was struck dead by a moving van br br the brilliant police force find a mysterious bit of film on him showing sheila's sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior but other than the film the guy is a complete mystery as the piteous police chief laments we know nothing about him except that he's dead poor guy he must be getting a headache from all this i recommend a nap luckily sheila is the kind of girl who can throw around tens of thousands of dollars like it's nothing in the search for her sister perfect for hiring a plucky backwoods guide caricature since the police are clearly going to be no help br br obviously nothing new is added to this miniscule sub genre quite the contrary cannibalism almost seems like a background to a completely different kind of bad movie about the rescue of a missing person from the dangerous elements thickening the plot of that clothesline is not difficult all you have to do is add in a cartoonish jungle cult of people who follow some guy who calls himself jonas who believes in using pain as a way to reunite man with nature a process they call purification personally i prefer just peeing outside occasionally br br one of my favorite parts of the movie is when sheila is caught by one of the cult members an overweight guy who looks like he took a three day weekend from the office to appear in this movie as he pulls out his trusty medical kit to give her an injection he warns her if you don't believe in jonas and purification through pain god help you he then gives her a shot and when she winces from the tiny pinch he politely apologizes to her i sense a true believer in this guy br br as far as the gore there are plenty of nasty sound effects over random shots of animals getting slaughtered and more than enough disgusting footage of women being cut up and eaten alive so i guess right there the movie lives up to its name the acting is astonishingly bad as can be expected and interestingly enough the editing is also spectacularly botched but still strangely effective br br unfortunately i think you have to be able to relate to people who believe in utterly insane cults in order to relate to anyone in the movie there are plenty of outlandish religious ceremonies that take place which make it more and more difficult to understand why sheila's sister decided to turn her back on normal society i'm all for individualism and doing your own thing but come on br br after a while the movie descends even further into your basic run of the mill escape movie just before we witness the most wildly inappropriate rendition of glory glory hallelujah in film history wow br br note in this movie a woman is raped with a severed snake if you need any more reason never to watch it seek professional help avoid this mess at all costs
<START> tagline the lucky ones died before watching this br br i've never watched a bulgarian movie from 1920's so i can't say this is the worst movie ever made but it surely is the worst movie i've ever watched i can't almost remember it br br all i can recall is a family of stupid people who don't do anything right their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand so they decide that there's nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there then there's an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the police br br and speaking of the police if those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years lots of people must have disappeared how come the sheriff didn't suspect anything br br but i gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so the rest is bore an unbelievable bore br br i will be merciful and won't speak about the dialogues and the acting and the effects br br i will only mention the final scene where the freak girl eliminates a snake the snakes they come out in the end what the hell do they have to do with the story with a sniper precise throw of a stone demonstrating the full disregard of mr craven for reality and for things that happen on planet earth in general br br i believe there have been riots when the film was first released in 1977 br br even being eaten by a cannibal wouldn't be a fair punishment to the director for this attack on intelligence
<START> jack frost 2 was a horrible terrible sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie the original was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste and the snowman went around murdering people and avoiding blow like the plague this however was a far cry from the quality of the original it seems like this even had a lower budget because for some reason after an hour into this film i still hadn't seen the snowman some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character disappointing to no belief even for a fan of bad cinema
<START> ray bradbury run and hide this tacky film version of his short story from the 1950s about time travel and the effect it might have on de evolution is not well known from the theatrical run did it have one and exists now as a dvd on the shelves released during a slow week br br what looks to be a fancy sci fi thriller form the opening scenes quickly fools us as the computer generated graphics are re run unaltered throughout a film that is supposed to be about different back in time where a major company sells macho guys in the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles one slip of the foot butterfly while on one of these ventures and the course of evolution is altered with resultant time waves rolling over the planet changing everything to man eating plants and beasties of course there is a pretty damsel who knows how to reverse the process and a hunky man to risk his life to act on her orders and everything is eventually ok br br yes that is the story and the most surprising fact about this poorly scripted abysmally acted mess of a film is that it attracted some fine talent to portray the comic book flat characters edward burns all buff and hunky is our hero du jour ben kingsley is the requisite bad corporate guy sporting a ridiculous white wig catherine mccormack is the know it all woman creator and as an evil one all are superb actors and should have known better than to align with this flop and the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci fi monster thrillers the creative department sold out with some of the corniest animation to hit the screen in a long time a must miss grady harp
<START> i had high hopes for this film even though i had not read the book richard gere and diane lane together should be good already but the film does not deliver on the promise i kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasn't i have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love that can happen but we never really get to know the characters i would have liked more focus on them the film reminded me in places of bridges of madison county and that film was far better i really felt for the characters in that film and there was a chemistry much more passion between clint eastwood and meryl streep that there wasn't between gere and lane each of them are very good actors in his or her own right simply not the right movie for them together
<START> i can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script br br 1 let's make a serial killer movie like se7en knight moves copycat and silence of the lambs people like serial killer stuff it'll sell 2 the killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern i know he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel that hasn't been done yet at least not exactly like that 3 now we need some kind of way to make this movie unique of course the good guy can be bedridden like in rear window 4 lastly we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of the sixth sense and the usual suspects br br okay now that you know these things you know the whole movie so don't waste your money one thing i really hate about moviemakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and completely run them into the ground i wrote better stories than this when i was in junior high i just kept checking my watch every five minutes when the twist ending finally came i wasn't shocked i just said oh who cares the characters are two dimensional they have your typical movie personalities this movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script i give this movie 1 out of 10 normally it would earn at least 2 or 3 but i'm so sick of the unoriginality when will they learn 1 10
<START> the story is a turn of the century troupe of actors along with producers and theatre owners have very complicated relationships a resident playwright has written a psychological drama he wants to get a good production on stage but can't unless he convinces a reviewer to revisit the production and give a positive review if his production does not go on then the troupe will put on the doll house recently written by ibsen many different relationships among the principals are explored none of them interesting but the involvement of the characters with one another lead to giving the play by the resident a second shot br br this movie is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a movie the story lines are incoherent to anyone who isn't a buddy of one of the stars the only reason i didn't leave the theatre after about a half hour is that a fat lady was resting a full meal atop her stomach at the end of my row
<START> love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking at it love was just as strong as in the west and war was often more poignant should i say more realistic br br this film is as much about war and love as it is about the soviet thaw of mr k's era it also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990's with rivers of and millions of usd spent on special effects and marketed actors br br this movie is a classic of soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies war br br
