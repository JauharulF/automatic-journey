<START> a beautiful film about the coming of early silent cinema to china shadow magic deftly combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between china's ancient traditions and modern western culture in the form of film an amazing first film by chinese director ann hu if i correctly understood ms comments at the 2000 sundance festival this film was produced as an american film with co funding by the chinese government and shot in china shadow magic reminds me of films like il postino and cinema paradiso not necessarily in theme or plot but it has a similar feel
<START> some people say this show was good in it's early years i disagree with all of 'em the show is just plain stupid and pathetic my mum hates it i hate it my dad hates it i don't know about my sister but oh well here some reasons why br br 1 the characters babies being used as grown up style characters are stupid the babies are just precocious and annoying the grown ups and adults are dumb and unappealing the worst character is that angelica pickles she really does it in for your ear drums when you had a long hard and miserable day at the office and also that kimi finster who appears later on she is too over optimistic and a pain in the butt she can't decided whither she is french or japanese it doesn't matter know you are a american citizen know and that's that oh what am i talking about all the characters from this show suck br br 2 the stories the stories are unoriginal and dumb the make it like the babies go off on a great adventure yeah to the back yard shed in one episode that little goofy brat tommy pickles the leader broke in to a television's control room and literally almost destroyed it don't give kids any idea to smash up normal t v station's control rooms they pay a awful lot of money for them in real life i can imagine what the broadcasters must of felt like airing this episode they will probably start staring at their machines throughout the day scared that a baby will brake in sad br br 3 over rated the show has been dragging on for years now and people are still making up stories and new series and spin offs for this get off the simpsons have been going for nearly the same amount of time as this but they are much better and funnier than babies the show is just plain over rated people where is your common sense br br anyway i surprised t v stations across the world want to air this series even off today the show is utter junk and should have never been produced the two movies for this cartoons sucked just the same 2 10
<START> having reviewed 3 of the 4 perry and croft sitcoms i thought i would get them all done now dads army is my all time favourite sitcom it ain't half hot mum is also a classic as is you rang i don't regard hi de hi as a classic but it is still funny br br it's about a holiday camp similar to butlins but instead of red coats it's yellow coats it is ran by jeffery a well meaning man but has the personality of a sock the staff include fun entertainment manager ted his sidekick spike he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode yellow coat gladys careless maid peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the punch and judy man mr partridge who hates kids situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool where someone would be thrown in every episode with there clothes on of course br br not a classic but still funny jeffery left half way through so this a bit like only fools and horses its welcome jimmy perry was actually a red coat at butlins br br best episode peggy's big chance series 2 episode 2
<START> in the late 1940s there was a short film series entitled flicker flashbacks in which excerpts from silent dramas featuring the likes of mary pickford and blanche sweet were played for laughs scratchy clips from antiquated old movies were rearranged projected too fast and given an overlay of music and lame quips the attitude expressed through this brutal treatment pretty much summed up mid century hollywood's view of its early days silent cinema was considered hokey florid a little embarrassing and only good for a chuckle during the 1950s this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons james agee's famous 1949 essay on the silent clowns for life magazine was a factor but television played a major role in viewers with silent movies admittedly the tv networks sometimes handled the material as crudely as the flicker flashbacks people but higher toned series such as silents please treated the films with respect another milestone was robert compilation feature the golden age of comedy which proved to be something of a surprise hit when it was released to theaters late in 1957 br br i don't know if charles chaplin was aware of film or its success at the box office but it was around this time that he decided to launch a theatrical re release of three of his best short comedies a dog's life shoulder arms both made in 1918 and the pilgrim made in 1922 and released the following year these three movies happened to work well as a trio since they contrast nicely in plot theme and setting in addition all three feature familiar faces from chaplin's stock company some of whom play multiple roles in each short at the time of the re release the films hadn't been publicly screened in over thirty years so perhaps chaplin was concerned about maintaining his reputation with a new generation of movie goers especially since his best work was seldom shown on television in the new early days br br unfortunately chaplin apparently concluded that the films moved too quickly at the old silent projection speed so the decision was made to stretch print them which meant that every other frame was printed twice maybe he wanted to avoid the flashbacks' look but this wasn't the best way to go about it aesthetically speaking the results were awful and practically destroyed the movies' flow of action but nonetheless that's how the chaplin revue was released to theaters in 1959 and that's the version that was transferred to video and made commercially available by playhouse video in the 1980s i purchased a vhs copy of the movie at the time and was terribly disappointed with the jerky stop and start rhythm of the films br br it's a particular pleasure to find that david shepard's restoration of chaplin's compilation originally produced for the laser disc format is a vast improvement over the playhouse video version for the most part the projection speed has been corrected the stretch printing is gone at any rate though the action seems to drag a bit at times for example in a dog's life during edna charlie's awkward dance in the green lantern cafe bare arms appear visibly blurred at another point during the trench scene in shoulder arms when charlie is relieved from sentry duty the action appears oddly slowed down for a few moments but this may be the result of a maneuver by the film to cover a bit of decomposition over all picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the movies themselves br br other bonuses the revue begins with rare behind the scenes footage taken at the chaplin studio this includes shots of an obviously staged jokey rehearsal session where chaplin diminutive actor loyal underwood as well as scenes of charlie at his dressing table putting on his makeup and trimming the famous mustache these scenes are accompanied by chaplin's narration delivered at a rapid clip chaplin also composed a new musical score for the compilation and in my opinion his themes for the revue rank with his best compositions especially the pieces used during the cafÃ© sequence in a dog's life the only exception is the song written for the pilgrim a pseudo singin' cowboy number called bound for texas sung style by matt monro sounding rather like gene autry which is distractingly anachronistic and out of place otherwise throughout the rest of the revue the music is perfectly suited to the action and the atmosphere br br it feels as though the image release of the chaplin revue is in a sense its long postponed debut presenting these classic comedies the way they were meant to be seen all along in this form the revue ranks with chaplin's most durable and enjoyable works
<START> i didn't expect a lot when i went out to see this but my god what a disappointment the original was kind of fun within it's genre but this is so bad i felt abused when i left the theater there's no plot it's not funny it's not enjoyable to watch it's straight out embarrassing after an hour i hoped my patience would be rewarded but now i regret not leaving the theater do yourself a favor and ignore this one see it when it comes to the small screen or see it on budget dvd whatever you do don't waste any money on it don't say i didn't warn you
<START> this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness not only was the name a complete misnomer since the film has next to nothing to do with piranhas but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off unfortunately i waited until the end in my case that's two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim
<START> unforgiven is clint eastwoods last tribute to the once great west but whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was sadly mistaken unforgiven though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that unforgiven is eastwoods worst film to date eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film br br all the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially eastwoods character the acting doesn't seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling the direction is poorly misled by quirky shots so overall unforgiven is not eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around
<START> i'm so glad i taped this film when it came on bbc last month it blew my mind so gut wrenching and real david tennant is absolutely fabulous in this even though his character isn't always that easy to like or identify with the final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart those eyes br br i'm guessing that he made this film in between the dr who series and that makes it even more of an achievement for me i just love dr who and yet i saw absolutely nothing of him in mr portrayal of this man who knows that he has changed and struggles to create some sort of new identity and life br br great little intense drama
<START> spirit and chaos is an artistic biopic of kenji a japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century the film captures and interprets his artistic method poems his inspiration the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination br br the film integrated excerpts of poems into the plot beautifully his relationships with his students was powerful especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom selfless compassion for the farmers in his village his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson to us all furthermore devotion to science was also nicely portrayed in a time when western ideas were still met with skepticism especially in provincial towns like the one where grew up he understands its usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by its elegance the way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the writer were truly intense and well interpreted br br i felt that the cgi integrated into the film while groundbreaking an innovative with the more organic animation it could be argued that this was intentional to represent conflict within the main character but i found it rather i also wish that the film had discussed buddhist influence but it worked fine without it br br i though this film was very well done i give it a 9 10 with the one point being deducted for the cgi otherwise the animation plot and dialog were all wonderful and heartfelt i haven't seen any other films by but after seeing this one i will be sure to give them a chance
<START> i saw this movie awhile back and can't seem to track it down does anyone know where i can get a hold of it i feel it is worth seeing again br br i'm sorry to say i had never heard of chloe until this film yes she can act when i first began to track this movie down i mistook it for another one of her movies sex spa the plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversed br br this is the first film i've seen dru berrymore i looked up some of her other films and i feel she looks better as a blonde br br i agree this is a good introductory movie not too soft not too hard you got to start somewhere
<START> the house of dracula really has nothing new to offer in the way of chills or thrills or new twists on an already tired storyline this film was made as a hasty sequel to the fairly better made house of frankenstein from a year earlier in house of dracula you can see the factory like production values of 1945 taking their toll on an otherwise potentially scary movie stock footage from previous films in the series and then the ending from ghost of frankenstein used as the ending here just makes for an el flick therein lies the shame of the studio and the producer considering that they had top notch talent and merely wasted everybody's time and effort on a quick money return scheme but that seems to have been the trend all throughout hollywood at the end of wwii this is what brought on some of those mindless scifi pics of the 1950's with all their closeups of harmless lizards in order to make them appear as dinosaurs the days of james whale and val lewton to mention two were over as far as creating real mood and atmosphere in this genre keep in mind also that the makeup genius jack pierce who actually did medical research in order to create all of our favorites was summarily fired right after this particular film was released a lesser capable makeup man by the name of bud westmore was then hired as the head of this department at universal soon to be universal international not to denigrate mr ability but horror films were just not his forte ok to watch or not to watch watch this film but only as part of the chronological order of the frankenstein series and you'll see how this all ended up as comic fodder for abbott costello
<START> lifeforce is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel the space vampires by colin wilson scripted by dan don a joint american british space exploration team makes a mind boggling discovery an alien spacecraft resting inside comet containing three entities that look like people one of them a female beauty the oh so alluring mathilda may br br they take these discoveries back on board their own spacecraft big mistake br br it turns out that these creatures drain the life out of human beings and as american colonel an intense edgy and committed steve railsback and british s a s colonel caine a solid peter firth watch in horror an infestation of vampirism overtakes london with the fate of earth in the balance br br this picture certainly is not lacking in imagination it moves a little slowly at times but offers so many strange and fanciful ideas and eye popping visuals that it's hard not to be amused the first of director tobe hoopers' three picture deal with cannon films he followed it up with texas chainsaw massacre ii and the invaders from mars remake he makes it something truly unique incorporating elements of sci fi vampire films zombie films and end of the world sagas it's like nothing that i've seen before br br railsback and firth are ably supported by such strong brit actors as frank finlay patrick stewart michael aubrey morris and john hallam mathilda may is very memorable as the bewitching enigmatic villainess it certainly doesn't hurt that she performs a great deal of her scenes in the nude also worth noting is a stirring music score from none other than pink panther composer henry mancini br br ridiculous it may be but i found it to be fun as well it's flamboyant and spirited entertainment br br 8 10
<START> despite the famous cast this animated version of dickens tale is the i've seen enough that i zapped away in he first commercial break the characters didn't appeal to me at all and the animation is looking cheap br br i'll give this movie a very low rating give me the disney version anytime
<START> pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie and that is precisely what happened here br br first off let me admit i am yet to play i intend to order it soon however i did do research to myself with the characters and the story however not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this and advent children demands that knowledge of is required br br in spite of incredible visuals i can't say there is too much thats new we've seen it in final fantasy the spirits within and apart from some better movement i can't say they've done lots of super daring stuff with this br br the fight scenes well they are a bit of fun still how could we ever doubt the result of any of them this one was boringly classic there were three fights with the bad guys following the standard procedure the hero cloud gets smashed then he almost gets there and gets smashed and then finally wins the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal but in this case is poorly executed i'll touch on that later br br the english dub seemed fine to me though i didn't watch it in japanese so i shan't judge the japanese dub but only the english one i'll say this i've heard plenty of better ones even in my limited repertoire br br and now the plot ummm what plot let me be frank this movie is nought but a fan service a chance to see the characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is never explained seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameo br br really was an ensemble piece advent children is anything but if they'd managed to give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was possible i might add then this could have been a lot better naturally that would have changed the plot too which lets be honest is almost set to be better than the one we got br br characters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten the members of avalanche thats the group cloud worked with in for those who don't know get 2 scenes 3 in the case of vincent valentine and some get even less hell the bad guys get more lines than these guys and that is pretty bad br br the music well i don't care if uematsu is god himself he botched this film big time advent one winged angel was the only decent piece otherwise he couldn't decide whether to be epic and orchestral or fun with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other you felt it as though he'd taken a sledgehammer to your head br br and that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you can't please everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a ceremony was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it you don't need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didn't belong in the film and nor did frequent appearances she's dead jim br br given just how fantastic i've heard final fantasy vii to be this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give it a 2 out of 10
<START> there was a lot about little vera that was strange to me all in all i did enjoy this movie but a lot of the way the characters behaved was not what i was used to for example the environment that vera's family lived in was very tense almost every time the family was together they were either drinking fighting or yelling and frequently it was a combination of the three after i had viewed the film i felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during it i was however very interested in watching the story if this middle class russian family throughout the entire film we are reminded of the industrialized state of russia because of the repeated shots of a train passing by the screen it gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life the characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work there was not a feeling of happiness throughout the film the only time a character was not yelling was when vera first fell in love with her fiancÃ© sergei this was very short lived because the viewer later discovers after sergei locks vera's father in a bathroom and vera lets him out after which the father proceeds to stab sergei that he is abusive another time vera is told that the only reason she was born was so the family could get a larger apartment it is very interesting watching how both vera and the family were able to cope with each other's behavior the film was definitely worth watching because of its depiction of how life could be in areas of russia
