<START> they made me a criminal is a remake of an earlier warner brothers film the life of jimmy dolan which starred douglas fairbanks jr as the prizefighter on the lam br br even with the restrictions now upon production by the hays office this remake actually turns out to be better than the original douglas fairbanks jr is horribly miscast as a pugilist john garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play br br they made me a criminal was directed by busby berkeley who jack warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals berkeley in fact would soon be leaving warner brothers for mgm br br berkeley does do a fine job here keeping the action flowing at a good pace i particularly like the scene where four of the dead end kids and garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down they get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity br br other performances besides garfield and the kids to remember are may robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and claude rains as the obsessed detective on garfield's trail
<START> i caught this movie late night on tv and was expecting a low budget campy masterpiece i was surprised with a pretty decent movie angelina jolie's unique acting capabilities or should i say lack thereof make her perfect as an android and the other actors while terribly average are at least not terrible br br there is a plot a fairly intricate plot at that involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple one human one android will go to pursue their illegal romance with a big brother type figure and android assassin thrown in the mix the production and sets also were much better than i expected i haven't seen the original cyborg so i can't really compare it to much else granted this film is no blade runner but as a late night futuristic guilty pleasure its worth a watch
<START> this is probably the worst film i have ever seen mike myers tries to be a dramatic actor and fails miserably the children who have the major roles are almost impossible to understand and are really unpleasant characters it was not even worth the price of the rental
<START> poor bela lugosi just another day at work a group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the american war effort from the inside it's pretty hard to figure out at first because while we know these guys are up to something their method of operation just isn't very clear i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing there are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero a police force that doesn't know what is going on what a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house there are comments like a true patriot would do this or that it's obvious while suspicion abounds most of the world wouldn't know a spy or a subversive if it jumped up and bit them i also was surprised to see clayton moore the lone ranger in a romantic role i never realized that he ever did anything other than sit on a horse there is of course the smugness of the criminals as they think that they are immune from the killer's guest list anyway bela is sort of a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it as a curiosity and a period piece it may be fun to watch for some people
<START> i've read the comments on las vegas and do agree with some of them it's not brain surgery tv but then again i was under the impression that tv was mainly for escapism especially with what is going on in today's world let's face it a show about vegas that isn't a reality based programme isn't going to one based on reality because to me vegas is pure fantasy it's the sort of place where we can go and pretty much do what we want when we want subject to funds obviously br br therefore the fact that las vegas is pretty sexy and cliched with characters that reflect all this seems to be on the money in my eyes if you don't like it don't watch it that what we have a million channels for br br we're coming up to the third episode here in the uk and i know that i will be making a beeline to watch it again i just hope it's not cancelled something that seems to be happening a lot with most of the shows that come to the uk that are half decent firefly and jake 2 0 anyone br br it's harmless great looking fun and everytime i watch it i want to go back to the real thing
<START> hbo created this show for purposes of making us see the most realistic view of prison possible and they did a hell of a job oz was created by the creators of homicide who wanted to show a raw version of prison this show is what launched the idea of every other hbo original program such as the sopranos sex and the city the wire arliss deadwood and six feet under amongst others oz is the nickname for the oswald state a fictional prison in some us state which is never stated though with the accents crime scenes and racial distribution ny is assumed the main prison unit looked at on the show is emerald city a seemingly ideal prison unit with more than others thought out by a liberal unit manager named tim mcmanus overall this show shows us what it is really like if one wishes to survive in prison br br there are about 10 gangs shown on oz first we have the muslims a group of blacks who wish to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve living conditions for blacks everywhere they are led by kareem said a black militant minister who wishes to destroy everything racist about the judicial system as a group they are not so much anti white but rather anti injustice our second group of blacks is the homeboys who are essentially the street blacks who wish to keep all the bad ghetto behaviors up and run the drug trade their leadership varies mainly because they are always losing members due to violence in this group one character who is acted terrifically is simon is an african inmate who is essentially the most frighteningly evil character alive this gang as a whole gets side help from the irish at times and is always in conflict with the latinos and for drug distribution purposes being that oz is mostly black the homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside br br the latinos and like the homeboys have varying leadership due to violent deaths that occur throughout the show the pretty much have the most substantial say in how any illegal activity gets conducted in oz the latinos make their presence known so that they can at least be coasting well if they are not in control unlike the homeboys however these gangs do not have as much internal battle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug usage the irish who are mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and ryan o'reily o'reily always manages to stay in good graces with all the drug powers and manages to manipulate things in his way whenever he wants they are in no illegal control but they are at least on good terms with all those who are br br amongst the whiter inmates we have the bikers and aryans the bikers are merely a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the aryans out most of the time the aryans are the most hated and hateful gang to most any viewer of oz they are led by vern who is amongst the most racist sickest and sadistic characters one will ever see both gangs control nothing illegal they just merely let the darker skinned inmates see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft we also have the others the others is a gang of outsider prisoners who are not necessarily a problem to any other inmate in this group we see tobias a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is forever altered by prison we also see augustus hill a black man bound to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who narrates the show and introduces the audience to every inmate the character's crimes are shown as they are introduced and augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison finally amongst gangs there are the christians and gays the christians merely stay religious to keep from going mental and the gays are a bunch of cross dressers who are often raped by other inmates br br this show gets in depth on a lot of issues dealing with the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any movie about prison since language is unedited we here more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other tv show augustus hill's commentary provides a good way for us to truly understand each and every issue involved with oz this show as good as it is is not at all for the light to medium hearted it explicitly shows drug use and distribution by any means possible prison rape murders fatal stabbings and general gore than anything anyone else has seen in my opinion it is the most influential and greatest show ever created but i can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show if you are at all interested by shows and movies about prison oz is a must see
<START> what a ridiculous waste of time and money this movie was the biggest loser of the year all the hype was a warning i am disappointed for julia roberts by far she is the most talented cast member i think her ability to truly act carried the film the buddy buddy boys club was a little too phony and to add insult to injury why bother to cast catherine zeta jones she only has the ability to ruin a film she lacks the ability to have on screen chemistry with anyone not to mention she lacks the ability to act she lacks chemistry with the other characters kind of reminiscent of america's she made the terminal terminal this movie is headed nowhere what a shame please please don't tell me 13 is on the way
<START> why did i have to go out and buy yes buy jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost it was a silly but funny horror comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george that and the fact that on the back cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all so i thought if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter gore in it it should be fun right well i was so dead wrong br br let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot i mean a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas as much as i love the premise i really hated the movie first of all while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie seemingly being shot on real film and all this sequel has the look and feel of a third rate soap opera it has this way too slick shot on video look the lighting is just plain awful bright white spots for the day look and stupid colors like blue and green at night the acting well don't even go there the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile that jamaican man was just moronic saying man after every sentence and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman all i could think of was a seventh rate chucky from child's play spewing dumb and supposedly witty one liners before he kills someone br br the best joke was were one guy asks why are you talking to your watch and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked thank god for that oh yeah and that little scene over the end credits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too but the worst thing about this movie was where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings a lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all off screen like i've read in many other comments there were indeed nice set ups to a head explosion a crushed body eyes being poked out tongue ripped out but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled from the back cover of the dvd wasn't even in the movie i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back meaning i didn't see sh t i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen and then i get to see nothing what a let down could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie that would be a shame 'cause only a decent amount of splatter fun could have saved this movie if you ask me seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me speaking of those snowballs they were done very poorly they made munchies look like state of the art 'animatronics' but i guess that was the whole point of it at some point the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi boy you really have to see it to believe it best is to not see it actually 'cause this flick is just too bad okay i did laugh with it for it kept getting worse and worse just stick with the first jack frost 1996 and you'll be okay just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror comedy but fun in it's own right br br it's funny but writer director michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2 and then focused on writing turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside starring ryan phillippe and identity starring john cusack so the man seems to have some talent after all br br now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies way to go mr cooney
<START> this must have been one of chaplin's most ambitious projects he throws in virtually everything from visual gags and blackout comedy sketches to social relevance romance even some violence the mixture is challenging and intriguing and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences like the one where chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their self sacrifice but the ingredients don't always click together and the mix and tone seem kind of disharmonious as for the famous final speech though undeniably honest it also seems a bit naive today with its allusions to a better world where man will overcome his hate and brutality and his soul will fly great by jack oakie and the beautiful goddard
<START> bad news for anyone wanting to film a full length parody of a lifetime network movie the makers of a deadly encounter have already done it albeit unintentionally all of the lifetime tropes are there a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker an unreliable ex husband who of course cheated on her while they were married and a police department that dismisses her complaints forcing her to stand up for herself especially jaw dropping is the scene where the heroine after enduring a break in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker decides to relieve the stress by going shopping having seen first hand the harassment of a co worker by some creep she met at church i know stalking is not a joke but it certainly is in this movie
<START> i rented the movie and liked it so much that i bought it elijah wood mikey and joseph bobby are outstanding as the two boys their new stepfather physically abuses bobby the abuse is implied for the most part not seen and a lot of passion in me to help abused children there is a magical quality to the movie as the boys' imagination helps them find a way to deal with the abuse you have to try to understand the story from a child's point of view i'm still thinking about the ending i've watched the movie 3 or 4 times and each time i think of possible new meanings i'm not sure exactly what richard donner intended me to think but this is an excellent film joseph and elijah wood will make you go hug your kids
<START> i saw wicked little things as part of the 8 films to die for horrorfest and this was the only film that disappointed me to wit a mom her little girl and her teenage daughter settle down in an abandoned house in the pennsylvania mountains every night however the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run about and slaughter anyone they find br br i guess the director was banking on his viewers being repulsed that children would be capable of murders and eating human flesh of which there are lavish close ups as a nice homage to george romero because the film just isn't scary otherwise simply put there are far too many establishing shots of the evil kids jogging to their next murder site if someone's gonna get it in the barn there will be a shot of the kids arriving at the barn oh the suspense and then moving in for the kill br br come to think of it why do the kids suddenly walk so slowly when they corner their prey and not that i have any experience in this but i think a shotgun blast will throw a child a lot farther than this film implies nor does it help that the mom is one of the worst parents i've ever seen in any film the lock on the front door is busted you have an eight year old daughter in the woods with bears and mountain lions fix it you moron plus mom and her oldest daughter look waaaay too close together in age even for a teen pregnancy and there's a pretty unbelievable death which involves sneaking up on somebody trying to push a car out of the mud with their butt br br i'm giving this a 3 because it tried as a splatter film it's not bad but for good scares go elsewhere

<START> one good thing this hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end an example of low budget film making at it's best writer director skip woods uses seemingly everything he could find ex lamborghini super model cow phone and an ear for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and all of his camera set ups br br another good thing this movie seems to be made for the dvd era with several segments that comprise a larger story similar to the work of tarantino and robert desperado each chapter of the film features thomas jane's main character spending one day at home encountering quick and memorable performances by aaron glen plummer mickey rourke michael jeter james legros and an unforgettable role by br br even another good thing not exactly a good thing but incredibly shocking and memorable every person who sees this movie remembers one important scene much as deliverance will always be remembered for it's awful rape of ned beatty thursday will go down as the movie where a woman forcibly rapes an unwilling man unforgettable br br one bad thing the title makes people think it is somehow related to or derivative of the friday series of films featuring ice cube br br grade a
<START> this film shows up on the premium cable channels quite often and i find that i keep watching it over and over again the performances are wonderful and the material has so much happening that there is always something new to take away from the film br br maybe i am too often distracted when watching films at home you know the drill the dogs bark the phone rings the popcorn finishes during the credits but this film is about people and what motivates us what enlivens us what causes rifts between us and what inspires us br br for me it is films like the love letter that keep me taking a chance on new films frankly i am surprised that the film is not better known i would love to see blythe danner and geraldine mcewan in many more roles they are a delight to watch kate capshaw is wonderful and i had no previous idea that she would be ellen degeneres plays a role that is much more complex than simply being the comic relief br br this film provides interesting visuals as a proper background to the characters and their interactions i find it refreshing every time i take the time to watch it
