<START> this is about as stupid as it gets br br a classic case of two dimensional characters who always act exactly contrary as to what a sane person would do in the same situation it reminds me of a scene in scary movie where carmen electra flees from the killer there are two signs one marked to safety the other one to sure death i am reciting from memory br br and just like in scary movie the characters always run into the direction marked sure death br br why oh why did the girl start the fire in the teller booth and hold the door shut did she prefer to die in the fire instead being killed by the guy why oh why after cutting and overpowering the driver did they sit him in the seat and have him being watched by the wounded guy instead of plain shooting him or at the very least knocking him out he was running over their friend and killing him a minute before yet they have scruples why oh why a hundred things more br br if this movie were a road you could not drive a single yard because of the holes everything is so far fetched it's starting to physically hurt at times br br add mercilessly overplaying actors and a small budget to that and here's what you get looking at the rating and the comments i get the feeling those people have been watching an entirely different movie br br the one thing missing really is the infamous red toolbox from while she was out a movie that is about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters
<START> this movie looked like it was shot with a video phone it had very little plot and unnecessary nudity the movie never really came together or made much sense and for a movie like this of course there were some unnecessary boob shots the director was obviously trying to make the movie subjective and different but it just never gave enough information on what was even really going on even in the end i was left with a mixture of anger and confusion confusion from the lack of plot and anger because i wanted my two dollars back from blockbuster and an 1 5 hours of my life back they should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie
<START> i have spent many years studying all the great directors like kurosawa lean fulci deodato peckinpah kubrick and admire them greatly my favourite film is once upon a time in america br br i have only recently become a fan of d'amato and while he was no horror master his films were extreme whether it be soft core hardcore or extreme br br porno holocaust is now one of my favourite films the way its shot is brilliant and the music is catchy br br joe d'amato wasn't a horror master he's no fulci or bava but however he was a master of erotica no other director could shoot erotic films like him he also never tried making any films outside of these genre's either br br long live joe master of porn and erotica
<START> spending an hour seeing this brilliant dan finnerty and his dan band perform their special on bravo is the most enjoyable hour i've ever spent watching tv this young man dan is such an incredible talent as a singer performer and even dancer he can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs all of which have only been sung by women to hip hop rock also songs written for women this guy can do anything i've seen him live at least 11 times so i was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of dan's overwhelming star quality do yourself a favor and watch this or better yet buy it
<START> naked deanna troi br br richie's brother chuck from happy days with a reverse mohawk br br death wish 3 has all this and more including one clever scene where chuck bronson's character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window br br chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody footprints leading away br br all i can say about death wish 3 is that it is one of most incomprehensible serious movies that i have ever seen loaded to the hilt with mayhem and nearly zero police response despite the use of military weapons to mow punks down by the score br br as i understand it bronson disowned this film but happily cashed the check from golan globus br br if you enjoy quality movies avoid this one but if you're in for a cheap jackass kind of thrill check it out
<START> for those who have enjoyed the asterix books and films you'll love this film yes i will admit that it does mix some of the books and films but the characters are brilliant and it's not just people showing off their cgi left right and centre i've already seen it several times and laughed my socks off at it br br of course it contains the main heroes asterix and but this time they have someone new to deal with br br with a sense of humour like that the will go on and on and on bless 'em
<START> please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the radio city music hall as an archivist re the music hall i know what is and what is not associated with the new york venue the film's theodore is just the music hall no are in the film only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun just thought you would like to know truly a wonderful film you will never guess who the is while watching this film till the very end what a superb plot and beautiful ice skating one never sees that kind of performances any more the roxy theater and the center theatres in new york city had ice skating performances on stage
<START> i thought it would be more fantastic a tale but the subject is rather down to earth compared to the story about the death carriage i was expecting in fact there is much more of a social drama as usual in the european authors' movies br br actors are interesting not overacting as in the average silent movie images are not so good as to be stuck in your mind as in bergman's br br this is true the comparison between the two movies is the main point here begins with a vision of a death carriage wherein character can see his own body there are clocks without hands he is compelled to look back on what he has done wrong there is a vision of his happy family in the country in wife doesn't cheat on him before his eyes but she wants to flee with the little children because it would never get any better with him eventually confession is some kind of a live judgement br br well i would just add that destroying the door with an axe because his wife locked it and plans to go away with the children reminded me of the shining which was much more of a fantasy tale with death hanging around
<START> is about a somewhat arrogant reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and finds himself looking after his sister who has down's syndrome he can't be bothered with her and basically just wants to get her off his hands he has better things to do at one point he finds that he has to take her by car she doesn't like flying across the country br br if that all sounds familiar to you it is probably because you have seen rainman ' a film far superior to its imitator afterlife ' that it copies the basic premise heck it nicks a few characters and even scenes too is not the fundamental problem with the film the fundamental problem is that i did not care about these characters br br the brother kenny kevin mckidd is a bit of a womaniser he has a girlfriend who comes and goes in the story and who learns to like the down's syndrome sister again this is taken from he is a journalist trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal when he ends up looking after roberta the sister he doesn't have much time for her and sometimes leaves her alone for a little too long when she wanders off he becomes even angrier towards her am i spoiling anything by saying that he becomes a nicer loving person by the end of the film br br roberta is not determined to be 'normal' she is 'normal ' and wishes people would stop treating her differently she is played by paula sage an actress who does have down's syndrome and her performance is easily the best thing about the film why did the screenwriter not explore her character more well probably because that would mean the characters would get in the way of the story when we surely already know the story anyway didn't the filmmakers see the problem they were creating br br for a film about a dying mother and her handicapped daughter the father is absent i think he is dead but i'm not sure it is surprising how little impact the film has on the emotions of the viewer the scenes are performed in such a standard dull way with such standard predictable dialogue that i found myself rolling my eyes br br i have nothing against sentimentality in films but it only really works if you care about the characters here the characters are so uninteresting and two dimensional that i didn't really think there was much to care about rain man' has an emotional climax but that moved me because i cared about the characters br br talking of climaxes this film has a stinker there is sequence at the end of the film that starts off as an unbelievable situation and ends up in even worse territory an unforgivably cruel trick is played on the audience the sequence is designed to move the audience but ends up being horribly manipulative and offending the intelligence of the viewer audiences aren't stupid and they know when the film is cheating what a cheap shot br br there is not one scene in this film that has the impact it should there are a few sequences that are funny yes but when the characters talk to each other i can practically see the screenplay in front of me moving predictably and never hitting anything that touches the mind or the heart there are those phoney arguments that are reserved especially for the movies where the other character knows exactly what the reply is why don't supposedly 'realistic' films not realise that in real life anger can be irrational and sometimes people can't express their emotions and they might say things that don't make sense or not be able to say anything at all all of the actors in this film deserve better material this film is not based on fact but i think a documentary on a family with a down's syndrome member would be much more interesting that way we might have had truth and emotion for some reason the characters in this film think that an emotion only involves saying something loudly and making a suitable facial expression br br out of 5
<START> rebecca de can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she's given to play if you cannot say something nice br br de portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she's a grown up and has become a of course brilliant shrink she has an affair with banderas whom we suspect of being ouch how original a serial killer sometimes she recalls banderas's mother in law tippi hedren's character in marnie but i wouldn't count on it hitchcock died twenty four years ago and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end but that ending is so far fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it the movie includes the obligatory conversations with a serial killer in the silence of the lamb tradition murders human beings and cats split personality and open ending in case the crowds should call for more apparently they did not and they were right
<START> when i first saw this movie i said to myself hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie why not rent it so yeah i rented it and went back home to see it when i inserted it in my dvd player i was shocked br br well first of all no one told me it was a mexican movie and was spoken in spanish good thing it had subtitles br br second it was nude nude nude since i have no background whatsoever in mexican movies you could see my shock when i saw it gasp covering virgin eyes noo br br third predictable to say the least but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies because i don't seem to care if it's predictable unless it's way over the top br br fourth how heidi and were reunited so cheesy br br fifth how the movie ended it was a bad bad ending how mr van der sudden approval to the mayor's election was because her daughter knew how to throw the party blah blah i was hoping that he wasn't that easy to accept it the director might have just rushed it br br after all of this bashing of the bad stuff the good stuff's are here to come the movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with being clumsy in the kitchen and all attitude valentina being poetic with words what i really also like about it was the song that valentina made with her girl friend that's all and for the other stuffs that i haven't mentioned they were just so so
<START> john knowles modern masterpiece a separate peace are one of many subtle and subtly is the watch word themes of love hate jealously denial and regret the 1972 version does attempt to address this style and what the book is a love story with war looming in the background br br the 2004 version does not use subtly at all but in the portrayal of the story what is staring you in the face when you read the novel is a love story and yes maybe it is arguable a gay love story in the novel and 1972 film version there are sexual undertones everywhere in the writings and dialog in the 2004 showtime film version these tensions were omitted and the actors were in there late twenties playing teenagers which caused for mature acting taking away from any tenderness or hesitation of innocence in youth br br i did not like this remake for more reasons the hair that broke the back was that phineas was given a surname on the letters he received from the draft boards is a character that does not have nor needs a last name john knowles did that intentionally br br though i accept the 1972 version the acting was at times a little amateurish so what it attempted to be sincere to the novel by shooting on location at phillips exeter academy that the devon acedemy was based on which also the writer john knowles attended as a student br br the directors and producers took all teenage exeter students with exception of parker stevenson whom attended the brooks school to play in a paramount film class act by preppies compared to this canadian college shot played with adult actors politically correct platonic version no veto on this sham try again the 1972 film version with john and parker stevenson was the real deal for a separate peace on the screen the showtime 2004 film made for cable version was not
<START> can't say this wasn't made well at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes and there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted but this is an oddly non hispanic film in the same way west side story was many years ago both the leads a brother sister team are excellent and memorable in their parts the setting a sort of underground car repair district in queens is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself but there's something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film namely what the sister feels she has to do to get by i can understand the brother's reaction but it just seems a little too easily come by to me the movie seems to suggest that people like these don't need our help that they'll find a way to survive without the usual support systems i wouldn't encourage anyone to believe that there would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted other than that as an entertainment it works well as an accurate depiction of a culture not so well i think
<START> there are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few let's start with the silly and annoying songs like ride little cowboy which just tended to accentuate the city slickers look of the silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for it br br i had seen the media hype before this movie was released and i saw interviewed on various tv shows and he had a very soft sweet lilting voice his body language was not exactly what people remembered who were fans of clayton moore and the lone ranger tv series did not help things by acting like a diva and talking trash about clayton moore after the producers got an injunction moore from appearing at conventions and other events as the original lone ranger clayton moore was not even allowed to sign as clayton moore the lone ranger he could only sign as the masked man the incredible amount of negative publicity that this move gave the film was only added to by the petulant attitude of who was very quick to tell reporters that clayton moore would be quickly forgotten once the movie came out br br sadly even after the movie was a total flop the company that owned the lone ranger refused to lift their injunction against clayton moore and he was never again permitted to sign anything except as the masked man and he could not don his black mask at any public appearances between diva personality and the negative publicity the movie got it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public worse yet a few weeks before the movie was finally released the news was leaked that voice in the movie had been over dubbed by james because the producers thought that did not sound very convincing as a cowboy the ridicule and derision that this news brought on the talk shows and comedy shows of that era put the last nail into the coffin br br but then there was merle haggard narrating his way through the movie apparently the producers were hoping that the macho image of haggard one of the outlaws of country music would add credibility to as the lone ranger the narration by merle haggard was just another annoyance that audiences had to deal with at times haggard rhymes his narration and it sounds like some weird kiddie movie combine the rhyming narration with the ride little cowboy songs and any credibility that could have mustered was destroyed by haggard and the soundtrack br br tonto was played by michael horse and as others have pointed out horse had a lot more personality than in fact perhaps because of allegedly combative attitude during filming it seems like horse was given a lot more dialogue and screen time than anyone would have expected of tonto tonto takes charge and often is the leader instead of the lone ranger i was expecting or hoping that billy jack would make a cameo as brother it would have made the movie a lot better horse is not only more interesting than but he says more and has better scenes perhaps it was a case of horse stealing the show from however since the movie was so wretched horse did not get much recognition unlike horse has had a very productive career in the film industry br br perhaps the last negative about this movie is the powder blue outfit of the lone ranger the material that was chosen for was more blue than what clayton moore normally wore at appearances that choice of color for the outfit just made look more effeminate in his role the comic book version had shown the lone ranger also wearing a red shirt and black pants and that alternative outfit would have helped look more convincing as the lone ranger br br the supporting cast mostly mailed in their performances they all look as if they were working on a tv episode and nobody seemed very convincing even the villain lost his edge due to the people around him overall i feel sorry for not only did he do a terrible acting job but it is obvious that the production and publicity were horrible and effectively sabotaged any chance the poor guy had even if he had been an excellent replacement for clayton moore i doubt that the movie would have done well as a result of the other factors as it stands this film is funny in a sad way
<START> ok i admit that i still associate sophie with la that was the main reason i went to see this film but it was so boring that i nearly felt asleep sorry but her talents as actress are not very convincing furthermore this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and cgi yeah for a b movie it is not that bad after having seen her in marquise some years ago also a very crappy film i thought that she would play more convincingly but la and may be the james bond the world is not enough seem to be the only good films with her is it her talent does she have a bad taste when choosing her films or simply bad luck
