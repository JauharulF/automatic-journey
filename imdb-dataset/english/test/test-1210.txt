<START> if you thought rosemary's baby was bad this one isn't much better easily one of the worst movies ever made like it's lame predecessor it goes nowhere fast br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it it can't be that bad surely firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the blair witch project yawn and does so very poorly so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a simpson's halloween special would be far scarier but if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice but overall i would avoid this film at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before viewing the best bit its only about an hour and a half thank god
<START> alright lets break it down why is this one of the worst films ever because there are so many answers to that question i'm having a headache come on cracker world mr the part with the arab guy its just awful i didn't really care about the whole white racism crap but when they did that thing with the arab guy i wanted to get the names of all the writers its really not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie it isn't even funny bad which was my first interpretation i hope the person who directed this movie doesn't commit suicide but it seems likely i don't see any other options don't ever watch this movie if you watch it u cant say u died with no regrets
<START> the saint takes over stars george sanders as simon templar aka the saint in this 1940 entry into the series it also stars wendy barrie jonathan hale and paul on board ship en route to the u s the saint meets and tries to make time with a woman wendy barrie who gives him the simon is coming to new york to help inspector fernack now thoroughly discredited due to a gangster frame up 50 000 was found in his home the gangster rocky roland drew of course was found not guilty at trial and he and his fellow mobsters pay the bill for the frame and attorney representation 90 000 in total today you need that to defend yourself against a parking ticket this was a murder rap br br rocky sends his bodyguard pearly gates to the lawyer's house to steal the 90 000 from the safe the attorney catches him red handed and sends him back to his boss with a message seconds later he's dead rocky meets a similar fate and on and on who's killing this group of gangsters the saint has to get one of them to talk so that fernack can be cleared can he get to anyone before they're murdered the woman he met on board ship reappears and figures prominently in the case br br few actors have a way with a line like george sanders and his dry wit good looks smooth voice and depth as an actor suit simon templar perfectly paul provides some humor as the nervous milk drinking pearly gates and jonathan hale is great as the sometimes exasperated but worried sick inspector fernack wendy barrie who appeared in many saint episodes is very good as the woman who captures simon's heart br br very enjoyable
<START> wave after wave of directionless nausea this film wants and at first promises to be quirky and original but is in fact obvious solipsistic and mired in clichÃ© driven dialogue which builds to a of awfulness and cheese by the end throughout the film we meet supposedly off the wall characters who are actually very dull and just don't quite work and who through the horrific screenplay like men in armour suits driving jeeps through mansion houses and spouting preppy existential obviousness accompanied by the of the film has occasional funny episodes often no funnier than a dog playing with its genitals which happened twice an index of the slapstick rudimentary humour of the film in general but by the end the film falls into an abyss' of complete detritus and the director's egocentric ramblings which made me want to gouge my eyes out watch this film at your peril
<START> definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life i can't find anything positive to say about this movie if this production is even worthy of that word br br this production is not even the standard of a low budget porn movie br br my question is simply why did someone look at the script and think hey i'm gonna make a movie out of this br br at the end of the movie i wasn't even hoping that nicole was going to make itÂ she was really that annoying br br so for your own sake do not watch this movie unless you want to waste 85 minutes of your life
<START> i actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie i was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels i made it about an hour through before i simply had enough curious to see what the general movie opinionated public thought of this movie i looked it up on this site i was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great i needed to have my say and here it is this movie is absolute garbage it was a chore to sit through the jokes were uninspired rehashes from other better shows and movies and leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below that actually may be a stretch even for that age i'm all for slapstick ridiculousness but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness i have an idea lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed now that's funny ha ha br br movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality the marx brothers' a night at the opera monty python's the meaning of life south park bigger longer and uncut and the list goes on don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap br br by the way i can only assume that the reason that david bar katz the other writer did very little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted i'm actually impressed that leguizamo was able to recover after this mess
<START> first of all i would like to say that i am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that i rented it i wanted to like it br br i think that the main reason that i was so disappointed was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller in my eyes a suspense thriller for british movies is like something out of a ruth novel something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon br br this movie started out with the promising note of being such a film we have our main character that suspects a man that he does not like of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants his notions prove to be right but the idea that his wife might be involved does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime br br the elements of a good suspense thriller were in place at this point but from there i felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is the film might have been enjoyable to me if the outside box had talked of a twisted lover's triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller this seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film i felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did i felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized so i have to give it a lower rating than i would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations
<START> if you think piano teacher erika kohut isabelle huppert in michael haneke's film la pianiste is the ultimate degree in the personification of derangement perversion and darkness i've got news for you the piano teacher in elfriede novel la pianiste on which the film was based is twice as repulsive disgusting deranged and even more fascinating though there can't be words enough to translate the level of artistic proficiency that isabelle huppert has reached here above all other mortal actresses in activity today and who else could have played this character with such emotional power complete with the best piano playing dubbing an actor could deliver br br in the novel as in the film there are two big antagonists to the heroine kohut her own mother wonderful wreck voiced annie girardot in a part originally intended for jeanne moreau and austria itself the mother personifies perception of her native austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist fascist or at least authoritarian behavior sexual and emotional repression and let's say ideals which are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental breakdown br br la pianiste also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to the one you think you love we tend to think our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves which may turn out to be a huge embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake here kohut learns the lesson in the most painful and humiliating of ways br br it must be mentioned that elfriede is one of the best known and praised authors in austria and europe well now she's got a nobel prize and that autobiographical passages can be inferred in her novel as she herself was a pianist and had a reportedly difficult relationship with her mother the novel also includes long passages about childhood and adolescence so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now haneke chose to hide this information in the film forcing us to wonder how she got to be that way don't we all know a erika kohut out there but he very much preserves the fabric of the book in his film unbearable honesty to the point where most secretive horrendous feelings painfully emerge envy cruelty violence jealousy hate misery sadism masochism selfishness perversion etc all of them unmistakably human br br i thought la pianiste was a deeply moving film very disturbing and thought provoking with a handful of unforgettable scenes and that's just all i ask of movies it also made me buy and be thrilled by the book discover a fantastic author i hadn't read before and listen again and again to schubert so my thanks to haneke and isabelle on the other hand if you're looking for light entertainment please stay away my vote 9 out of 10
<START> there is a special heaven reserved for people who make the world laugh alongside chaplin stan and ollie the marx bros and fill in your own special favourites space must be made for everybody connected with airport 80 concorde the movie robert wagner in particular exceeds all expectations giving the comedy performance of a lifetime i would never have thought he had it in him the only way he could have been funnier would have been to have worn a red nose and a revolving bow tie british moviegoers will recognise the fat one from cannon and ball pretending to be a russian athlete a nice trick if he could have pulled it off but tragically he couldn't i have a 14 year old labrador more athletic and almost as funny george kennedy bless him has a part that requires him talk and move at the same time and my goodness he triumphs brow wrinkled with effort he utters timeless dialogue each word lovingly polished into coward like brilliance only once in twenty years does hollywood turn out a film like airport 80 all the years of toil and struggle the sweat the tears the lessons with lee strasberg living out of suitcases born in a trunk etc etc all come to fruition a work of art is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them on i think i'm ready for my medication now
<START> and the title says it all a cheesy sounding title that is a cheesy sounding joke of a film known as alien from l a why not just call it alien from south africa as this is the place where this movie was filmed my advice for watching movies that have been featured on mystery science theater 3000 do not watch the original version of the movie at all period always watch the movie with the theater shadow at the bottom of the screen with a man trapped in space with his two funny wise cracking robot friends sitting at the lower right hand corner of the screen it just seems better that way br br movie as it was originally seen awful movie as it was seen on mst3k genius
<START> the dvd release of this superior made for tv bbc drama is a more than welcome addition to my collection great acting gripping story and wonderful direction all add up to one of the best bbc dramas in years
<START> i must admit that this is one of the few lou costello films that i actually saw in the theater most have now been seen on t v and i must admit that lou is really enjoyable and he gets the girl too this was my first time seeing dorothy perform and of course i fell in love with her like so many others that day i have seen most of the work she has done and enjoyed each one her performance in the great race is one of the reasons i bought the disc in the first place br br every comment on this movie tells that this is the one movie that lou costello did with out bud abbott which is true but if lou had lived he would have made many more he really does a good job and doesn't have to rely on his old routines to get laughs i for one am sorry that the little man from patterson n j didn't get the chance to do that br br i hope this comes out on dvd some time so i can add it to my comedy sci fi collection
<START> i love this film maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do it kept me laughing for the duration duration of the film the next day and beyond i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40 i think sacha barren cohen was very and i do mean very good he is a genius and the reason h is such an idiot is because he can make people believe he is a complete idiot and make it funny at the same time br br very good film strongly recommend not so strongly if you are over 30
<START> i'm not a movie snob i've liked lots of movies that critics hate and i've hated movies that critics love however i have to agree with critics here galaxina is just substandard clearly intended to be a comedy it only has a few scattered laughs galaxina has poor photography it has poor special effects it has some pretty poor acting and the production values well the sets might as well have been made of cardboard br br galaxina tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called the blue star after a long voyage and some very unconvincing space battles the crew arrives at its destination a sort of wild west alien world there's a painfully unfunny cantina scene clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous star wars scene a chase involving space bikers and a final getaway br br the cast tries but can't breathe life into this turkey stephen and avery schreiber have done better work in other movies james david hinton is pretty good as a member of the crew the late dorothy stratten stars as the robot of title and while she looks great her role doesn't give her much of a chance to act br br you might catch this film to see dorothy stratten however if you're looking for a good movie you'll probably want to skip this one
