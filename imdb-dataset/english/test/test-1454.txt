<START> there's not really that much wrong with crash of the moons basically it's a few episodes of rocky jones space ranger merged into a film it is extremely dated however treatment of is a good example of this one has to remember that it was geared to be shown to children in the 1950's in this respect it succeeds if you like children's sci fi from the 1950's go ahead and take a look at it you'll see john banner in a pre sgt schultz role he does a pretty good job in it all in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10 not great but not bad
<START> i registered at imdb solely for the purpose of warning others about this movie does anyone ever get funding for projects like this that's the mystery farewell to harry might be the worst movie ever except that i tried to erase the others that rival this idiocy bad plot not credible logic runs throughout i can't spoil this movie for you by revealing anything that would make your experience less enjoyable there is nothing enjoyable about this movie i have the cd and will send it to you for free it is that bad first come only served if i know you this offer is void because i wouldn't inflict this movie on anyone not on purpose you have been warned
<START> this is definitely nolan's most and thought provoking piece not to say that memento or insomnia are bad but they were definitely up to more hollywood standards while following is more of an indie flick the story is very brilliant and very well developed overall watch this if your a fan of any of nolan's work i'm sure you'll be able to appreciate it more
<START> when i went to see bon voyage i expected a good skillful on the order of grand hotel 1932 and les enfants de paradis 1944 it was better than that with few exceptions none of the characters were totally good or totally evil just as in real life the acting was wonderful especially those who played raoul and camille the photography was amazing as it recreated the period perfectly and managed to be shot in around bordeaux during a time of new public works but managed the look of june 1940 costumes and make up were accurate there is so much in this movie that it's worth a second viewing it's exciting funny and ultimately touching n b be sure to see it in a theatre with good quality projection it's in wide screen and in the theater where i saw it the in the first 30 minutes had the subtitles at the bottom in focus but the actors' faces slightly fuzzy this was ultimately corrected but detracted from the pleasure of the film
<START> this is a good film for die hard chucky fans okay i'm sure it's not as good as what the child's play movie were like but this can get really funny and enjoyable chucky's laughs are hilarious br br spoilers br br now not one doll but two meaning double the impact jennifer tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie br br if you have seen the child's play movies this would be a worthy film on your chucky collection but if you've never seen the child's play movies before this'll will be a new start of course you'll not have a clue on how chucky got into his current state cause i'm not telling you but you'll figure out why chucky is very popular br br overall a very enjoyable movie
<START> the hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from agatha christie and of course poirot it' s set on a country house on a weekend as always all the guests are suspects and it's up to poirot to figure out the truth with movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so i'll stop here what i loved in the hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way when poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example everybody seems to be the culprit there's that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story br br you can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experience br br the actors are all very good as a curiosity notice edward hardwicke who played dr watson in sherlock holmes nice to see him after a few years suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time br br i did find out who the murderer was but still it's not predictable and it's also very believable br br so in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure br br
<START> stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie's leg cast string and manages to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation calms down stan gets ollie's clothes as the doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with a sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and a little predictable classic comedy it isn't great but it's a black and white film worth looking at stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian okay
<START> honestly mr if you do a drama movie in a high school setting following a bunch of teenagers through a school day and if you mess up the time frame and jump back and forth if you do that you can't use the exact same visual story telling device of elephant which is using a camera that is passing of from one character to the next and having scenes shown 3 times from different angles you just can't do that because this is such a blunt rip off its hard to believe anyone gave this more than a 5 rating br br where elephant which was released 3 years prior to this movie uses school shootings or to be exact the columbine shooting as the focal point for its script 2 37 uses teen suicide and seeing the reviews the shock value of that subject worked its the same slow story telling a lot of dramatic piano music all leading to a finale you know from the beginning at least the characters look like they tried hard to be somewhat different in that department so you got a untypical gay guy who looks acts like a stoner skater a hunky lover boy who can't deal with his gay side brother and sister from a rich family who both got their very own problems and here comes the nose dive br br you also get a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ever a guy with medical conditions who wets his pants because of 2 syndrome who actually never heard of the invention of diapers but rather pisses his pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and does so every day wow as hard as this movie tries to be realistic this is the most absurd thing i have ever heard he gets beaten up on the toilet and is obviously ashamed of it but doesn't wipe the blood of his nose when going through the whole school with wet pants and a bleeding nose thats new age realism directly leading to the twist and final character who turns out to be the suicide victim br br after watching the very realistic life of teenagers one day including incest rape teen pregnancy bulimia parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject mentioned before kind of like your very realistic daily soap trying hard to be we watch a girl die we met once in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but that the guy she had a crush on left the room when she was talking to him in a thoughtful piano playing sequence btw seen that somewhere before and it gets even better before slitting her wrist in a painful long scene of yes and no she asks 2 guy if he is ok constantly smiling and then she cuts her wrist with scissors in a school toilet br br now you got a movie that is a total rip off of elephant fails with some really sloppy story telling the whole rape incest thing was pretty unbelievable too by the way and people call this a shocker br br what the heck is going on is all it takes to take some pseudo dramatic music boring story telling and adding a shock subject on top and people think there is a major deep message here i think elephant is way overrated already but that movie was the original while this here is an obvious rip off failing on many more levels i have never ever seen a more brazen stealing of a whole movie concept in my life and believe me i watched a hundred of horror movies so i know how low you can go there this is a total let down in all departments its nor realistic its stolen its damn slow and by all means i wonder whats more useless another romantic suicide many give this point to the movie which makes me wonder if they only watch romeo juliet all day long because there is dozens of movies which deal with the subject in a clear non romantic and more realistic way or this ridiculous set up come on i am still trying to work out if 2 guy or the suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous
<START> two hands restored my faith in aussie films it took an old premise and made it fresh i enjoyed this movie to no end i recommend it to those people who like guy ritchie films bryan brown was fantastic and just about perfect in a role tailor made for him ledger was dumb and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me
<START> one of the better teen comedies to be filmed during the 80's valley girl has a young nicolas cage in a starring role deborah foreman is fun as the object of cage's desire and whatever happened to her look for veteran actors colleen camp and frederic forrest as julie's hippie parents they're quite funny
<START> two little girls strike a friendship one tries to convince the other she's a witch the other is a pushover who bends to the would be witch's will on and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls with many a dramatic cut away as they pose shocking questions you know the kind sweet little children shouldn't ask such as how do you make a deal with the devil oooh creepy br br in the end the pushover is sick of being controlled by her witchy friend her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end but by the time it comes you won't care in the least br br i can imagine this film may have been frightening to a very religious 1960s mexican moviegoer but it doesn't even hold up as a charming relic it merely drags on it is boring it is pointless it is not to be watched br br there are many here who have a lot of good things to say about it based on their knowledge of the director's other works and of course that common denominator everyone says about pointless films ah the cinematography is wonderful those reviewers probably have a point but for the ones who found this movie with no prior knowledge who don't care about its photography its atmosphere or its whatever else it has for these viewers then who just want a good movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half do yourselves a favour folks br br skip it
<START> johnny knoxville has gone insane br br in the first jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff Â his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme candid camera Â but in jackass number two he's really off his rocker br br beginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull or later when he rides a rocket a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket and especially when he stands willfully in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of to the stomach knoxville is a madman in the first film bam and steve o Â notorious party animals Â were the daring ones but you know it's pretty bad when you see knoxville enticing them to do a stunt br br this is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone constantly trying to one up each other it will eventually end in death for one of the cast members Â in jackass 2 steve o nearly loses a leg to a shark knoxville as aforementioned is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket and so on and so forth jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2 and frankly i can't imagine any stunt out performing the bull run in the opening scene of this film Â that's incredible footage it's almost unbelievable and i wondered whether it had been faked but apparently it was 100 genuine which is actually kind of frightening and in terms of extremes jackass 2 far outdoes its predecessor Â it also feels more cinematic than the first film with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original mtv television show br br unfortunately the boys were given too much freedom here and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity Â i can enjoy the occasional poop gag but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet or see steve o take beer up the butt yes honestly gets grating after a while even the frat boys in the screening i attended Â who were enthusiastic when wee man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair Â were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film it's not a matter of getting away with as much as possible Â it's a matter of saying is this even entertaining or funny many times sadly it really isn't br br but for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people's faces there are some brilliant hidden camera bits wacky director spike adaptation dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked with sagging breasts and no shame and my personal favorite skit involved knoxville as an irresponsible old man out for lunch with his grandson letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people that's classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an r rating it's a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff Â including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank Â with poop jokes along the way br br still there's enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing and it's really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights
<START> i was 13 yrs of age when i saw this greatly underappreciated film at the adams theatre in newark nj i purchased the program and later bought the soundtrack still have both i am now 55 yrs and have not seen it since possibly once on network tv in 1960's one of the greatest casts ever assembled great score and production please let another generation see this great film it was my introduction to opera and aided with my understanding of tolerance please family of or release this classic soon
<START> the third film from the polish brothers is their best most beautiful imaginative film yet though many audiences will have a problem with lack of traditional dramatic structure stick with it jack the plot is difficult to summarize so just know that the story includes agents trying to evacuate a city god in a cowboy hat the selling of angel wings and a sick orphan but it all works m david extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at the performances of the actors working with the polish brothers' offbeat script are pitch perfect and give the film its emotional punch the strong willed audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story the comic and moving actors and finally the incredible courage and command that michael polish shows behind the camera again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience a great great great movie
<START> i went along to this movie with some trepidation the original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting and unfortunately my fears were realized this is a humorless piece of work and i sat in the theater waiting for the wit and humor to begin i'm still waiting it seems updating the storyline to the present time just didn't work and the altering of characters an absolute travesty why did they introduce bette midler's character when she disappeared just as quickly as she arrived the related character in the 1939 original was an integral part of the plot the women in the cinema laughed a few times but nothing touched me as being funny with the exception of a line from meg ryan talking to her mother about her situation and telling her that 'it's not like a 1930's movie' i sorely wished i was viewing the 1930's version it was all too touchy feely stick together' and really needing some of the acerbic wit and clever dialog from the original play i still watch the original movie and pick up a line that i have never caught before there is no sense of closure to this new version and whilst the 1939 movie is politically incorrect by todays standards each thread was tied up and when the movie ended it did so strongly this remake should be labeled with a warning for any viewers if you know the original don't bother i felt cheated by losing part of my life in a cinema watching this unmemorable piece of fluff bring on the jungle red
