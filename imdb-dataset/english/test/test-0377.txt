<START> based on the actual event this epic is set in the year 221 b c and tells the true story of the unification of china action packed and filled with intrigue passion betrayals and unforgettable battle sequences it held my attention throughout in spite of its 160 minute length br br the king ying played by li is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of china and becoming its first emperor his lover lady zhao played by the beautiful actress gong li devises a plot whereby she will travel to the neighboring kingdom of yan to set a fake assassination plot in motion which will give the king an excuse to invade yan however she falls in love with the assassin as the king becomes more and more ruthless br br there are subplots and tragedy and constant high drama there are scenes of great beauty and of abject cruelty there is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space br br the deep characterization made me think of shakespeare and tragic events that call to mind greek drama and yet it is totally chinese as it deals with age old questions of whether the ends justify the means and raises the questions dealing with life and death and good and evil and all the blurred edges in between br br it is the story of individuals against the backdrop of history a history that has shaped china for the past two thousand years i was swept up in the story as well as the moral questions raised there are no easy answers and this was one of the strengths of the movie br br recommended but be prepared for the violence and gore br br

<START> normally i wouldn't go to the trouble of commenting on a horror movie sequel because it's usually assumed that they're bad and if you watch them with a healthy disrespect they can be very fun and enjoyable to taunt laugh at however this chapter of the ongoing halloween saga came close to up everything the original stood for in the very first movie dr loomis said very pointedly i might add that michael myers was evil and this tries to explain why doing a bad job of it i might add in my opinion he was much scarier when he was just a blood hungry freak the whole goth cult thing was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the halloween equation the result was a boring predictable movie that was not scary and not bad enough to be funny
<START> 2001 wasn't perhaps eric roberts best year both raptor and this came out watched raptor a while ago and really thought it sucked and being erics worst but that had itÂ´s share moment of fun and d standard this one doesn't have a thing br br tommy lee thomas is the name of the probably worst actor in these days the story lacks any punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a snail breaking in curves br br the two thing that stands out are martin kove and eric roberts you could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticism br br i say thank you roberts see you next time and hopefully a better one
<START> describing stalingrad as a war film may be a bit inaccurate sure it centers on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history in the most expansive theater of the most costly war in terms of lives money and that has ever occurred yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction the visceral storytelling and harsh images though make it something more than a war film even more than an anti war film stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and undeniable hell br br the film is fraught with visual descriptions of the worst kind of war one that is intensely personal and close where days are spent in taking one city block only to have it re taken in a surprise assault the early form of modern urban warfare that the germans came to call rat warfare is depicted in brutal and uncompromising terms the characters war in sewer tunnels rail yards and from building to building in the hellish bomb scape of ruined stalingrad only to be defeated by the unforgiving russian winter br br the film deals with the issue of nazism and the vilification of germans in that period in the way that many other films from both germany and the rest of the world do its characters are a group of soldiers swept along by the winds of war and simply attempting to make it out with themselves and as many of their comrades as possible alive the characters do not fight the soviets out of any ideological hatred between national socialism and soviet communism not for any grand dream of or racial superiority they fight only because if they do not the enemy will kill them and if the enemy does not then their own officers certainly will for refusing to fight this portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film br br a sort of ground based companion to das boot stalingrad frames the epic struggle of world war two in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary german soldier as a sort of hero made tragic by circumstance and a brutal government that would pervert his sacrifice
<START> created by dennis spooner was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of interpol based in geneva created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle if a plane landed at heathrow with no one aboard if a man was found wandering around london in a space suit if the passenger of a rolls royce suddenly into a skeleton if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead you called on to sort things out br br peter wyngarde played king' a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases king caught the public's fancy and was later awarded a spin off show he was ably assisted by american joel and the delectable rosemary unusually for a '60's show the department was headed by a black man curtis dennis peters if the show looked and felt a lot like 'the avengers' it was hardly surprising it shared many of the same writers and directors the colourful titles were designed by chambers partners and are worth tuning in for alone as was the case with so many i t c series the music was composed by edwin his theme for has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all time br br predictably the show looks a little sexist and dated now but don't let that dissuade you from tuning in imagine a hybrid of and the 'austin powers' movies and you've got br br trivia note the episode 'a small war of features a young sir anthony hopkins in a major role
<START> i have never seen american werewolf in london but this movie was very entertaining when renting it i thought it was a horror movie but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects i thought the transformation sequences were nicely done but effects wise the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built off each other nice the transformations reminded me a lot of werewolf transformations in other movies but the werewolves themselves are very beastly and not very dog like gore i do believe there is too much in this movie which really takes away from the horror when every frame has blood in it taking the violence seriously is hard br br j hurst 8th grade
<START> for awhile i was hooked on shows like ghost hunters and destination truth and stuff even though i thought they were full of crap i found them interesting and entertaining and that's why we watch entertainment tv it's fun to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow caught on camera is not just some shadow but some insane asylum tormented spirit or something so long as you can snap back to the real world later br br that being said enjoying paranormal state requires more than merely shutting your brain off it requires you to consume lead in large doses on a regular basis during your childhood then suffer repeated head trauma then take up huffing paint in your teens then you have to get high drunk and watch br br paranormal state is beyond the pseudoscience which i can enjoy with a degree of critical thinking that you'll find on ghost hunters which i still find to be reasonably interesting and entertaining program it's pseudo everything br br the show follows the adventures of a group of students from penn state university not to be confused with university of pennsylvania lead by ryan as they take it upon themselves to exorcise demons and spirits using ceremonies from whatever religion seems most dramatic at the time ranging from catholic exorcisms performed by college coeds to spells cast by socially awkward to native american cleansing rituals to their credit these are performed by native americans if you believe in or you're catholic or a follower of a traditional native american religions i think you'd want their cleansing rituals performed by someone who isn't a maladjusted college student with some free time i don't remember the scene in the exorcist where the priests threw up their hands and said it's no use call up an after school club from the state college this one is too much for us they've probably read the wikipedia article on exorcisms the show is frankly insulting to the intelligence to the viewer the show's opening title sequence has ryan talking about the paranormal research society saying that when he came to penn state notice you don't see any shows where the host says the same thing but instead of penn state he says when i came to mit or after i got my theoretical physics degree he found other people with similar interest in the paranormal he says they are sometimes warriors i remember when i used to pretend i was a warrior and i fought ghosts i was six then the emotionless ryan brings out the flamboyant and obnoxious chip coffey who pretends to go into and become possessed by cussing at the cast awesome i thought people had learned some sense about how ridiculous the idea of psychics and mediums is after crossing over went off the air the show takes itself way too seriously as this small group of societal misfits pretends they are battling against some ancient cosmic evil production values are low stories are boring and unlike ghost hunters which will occasionally catch something anomalous although likely explainable but interesting nonetheless on their equipment ps requires you to believe that the noises and creaks that they hear are evidence of demons ghouls and possibly the only thing scary about this show is that there are people out there that take it seriously the only thing paranormal about it is that the people on it are able to make each episode while keeping a straight face br br call me jaded but i feel like the great mysteries of the universe and the afterlife are too great to be solved in a half hour tv show by a journalism undergrad at a state school br br all that being said i highly recommend that everyone watch this show at least once if for no other reason than the sheer entertainment derived from watching a truly terrible movie or tv show or you can make a drinking game out of it i think the second would be preferable
<START> although this was the first hunter s thompson documentary i have seen it was average at best despite the of huge star appearances such as johnny depp bill murray gary busey and a few others i was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting what kept me watching was some of the old clips from fear and loathing in las vegas and where the buffalo roam not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know i still think they were milking it because it could have been compressed down by at least half still if your a fan i would you'll like anything that has to do with hunter best regards
<START> this film is one of the worst adaptations of pride and prejudice ever filmed and if jane austen were alive she would demand that her name be removed from the film austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between elizabeth bennet and darcy it is also a commentary on the class structure of regency britain this film focuses only on the love story thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel br br there are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film in the film the dance at which darcy snubs elizabeth is not the refined dancing done by the gentry to which the bennet lucas and darcy families belong but is rather the dancing of the lower classes the gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance there are costume and hair problems too the custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear when outdoors women of the regency period were not so liberated as to forego the bonnet requirements in public the worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of elizabeth in her nightgown and coat and mr darcy sans cravat and vest at which they admit their love for each other this is an unforgivable liberty with the novel no respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour br br but the worst thing of all with this film is the mangling of austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he she can write like austen the writer of the non austen dialogue not only lacks austen's talent but also has no feel for austen's style the juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring br br as for the acting the best is done by judi dench who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy brenda blethyn takes some liberties in making mrs bennet less awful than austen's portrayal her portrayal is interesting and seems to work donald sutherland is miscast his affected british accent is terrible and he portrays mr bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century matthew portrayal of darcy is flat i can't imagine anyone falling in love with his mr darcy keira knightly is a pretty elizabeth but her portrayal of elizabeth bennet is far too modern knightly focuses on the elizabeth's but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time she would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period br br if one is making a period movie one must be true to the period this film needed an historical adviser who actually knows something about the regency period it also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of austen's text i can only hope emma thompson decides to do a film of pride and prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds br br the best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the english countryside chatsworth is well used as as it was in the 1995 bbc adaptation but pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film true fans of austen will rush home to watch their dvds of the far superior 1995 bbc production with jennifer ehle and colin firth or to read austen's text in order to wipe this version from their minds
<START> set in a california detention camp in an future an english film crew capture proceedings as young students and political are put on trial under a fictional act' that allows the united states government to suspend civil liberties for its own citizens in cases of emergency without the right to bail or the necessity of evidence in such cases the government is authorised to apprehend and detain anyone they believe may engage in future activities of sabotage the group on trial includes a feminist a black panther and a folk singer br br those convicted by the a conservative tribunal have the choice of a lengthy prison sentence or three days in punishment park in which they can attain their freedom by reaching an american flag in the desert they must accomplish this without food or water they are also to be pursued by armed national guards and police who can return them to the camp if captured to face the penal sentence attributed to each person convicted the reality is different those that choose punishment park are hunted and killed or brutalised with no hope of gaining their freedom after a policeman is found dead in the park the park seems to be a training ground for the police and guards who need to master these acts of suppression so they can be put to use in open american society br br shot on 16mm and in the documentary style developed by in his celebrated culloden and the controversial the war game for the bbc he interacts with the prisoners and guards and observes the unconstitutional trial inter cutting between them to create a totally convincing political movie that still remains vital and relevant using his knowledge of the medium has produced a driving relentless and ultimately frightening film portrayal of an entirely fictional american political detention camp that would not convince if it wasn't for his flawless construction many of the actors are amateurs improvising with broad characters the sparks fly in the trial scenes in which each case is heard in part to the fact that kept those on trial away from the jury until the filming of those scenes also claims that the actors are often expressing their own opinions which certainly explain the ferocity as well as the believability of their performances br br the film has been heavily criticised for the opinions of those that see it it has been claimed that the film is reactionary and unequivocally represents that conservatism and war are the root of america's social problems while these criticisms may be valid it is important to consider that the film is working on a fictional metaphorical level and it is perhaps the realism that the film so cleverly constructs that encourages such a heated opinion on its content in fact the films most important theme is the problem of itself the judges and brutal law officers are on one side and the convicts are clearly on the other with no concessions made on either side this seems to be what the movie is really about the new law and the park itself is the outgrowth of a situation where mediation between the two political positions has been lost br br made during and in protest to the vietnam war and the treatment of those who opposed the war in america the films main themes of governmental persecution of its own citizens and conservatism on civil liberties still strike the same chord in the era of the patriot act and the identity card it also strikes a disturbing chord with news footage of guantanamo bay and the treatment of iraqi prisoners at the hands of allied forces br br the threat of internal is such a volatile issue that the film cannot fail to connect with current attitudes to the subject not surprisingly the film has had a checkered distribution history being marginalised to an extreme due to its content but the disturbing fact that this movie is that can still remain so relevant today suggests that the wait has not been for nothing punishment park is a film that has had to fight to be seen anywhere and it demands your attention
<START> this might be for those who have been to summer camps but it sure isn't an entertaining camp i went to one before but it didn't make me scream up and down for joy instead it made my head hurt br br the first thing you notice is that bill murray actually had some hair in the 70s yeah and he also didn't mind running some but to get him to run a lot you would need to give him a woman to chase after br br its not that some of the stunts can't be funny for example the running joke with one of the councilors who is always waking up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed instead its that the jokes and stunts were poorly setup and executed it just failed to be funny br br to somebody who loves comedy this is a pain others are glued to it for life i wish it was more like leonard part 6 but it doesn't come close f
<START> the show is at least partially faked so is not reality just pretending to be reality which makes me believe at least anyone without face blurred out is a fake episode br br proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed there is already camera crew on the boat before he gets there can been seen as his boat approaches br br the actors playing ambulance officers didn't remove his shirt or expose the wound in anyway so they work on it which would never happen in reality br br they also parked the ambulance in the car park and did not drive up to the emergency entrance which does not make any sense unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there
<START> ever i always wanted to write that many years ago in 1993 as i recall it one of my former classmates persuaded me to watch what he called a epic masterpiece to this day it stands out to me as the worst movie i have ever seen the acting the story the effects everything is bad unless you are one of these people who just loves to appreciate trash you should pass on this however chances are that since you are reading this you've already seen it br br out of almost 500 movies this is the only non short i've given a 1 10 br br i haven't seen any other low budget asian warrior flicks so i guess there's even worse things out there scary br br p
<START> the first time i saw this film it was with this cute girl i was attracted to we had a lot of fun laughing at it and generally making fun so my impression was that it was terrible but watchable for value then as part of our anniversary we watched it together again on video as it turns out the movie is just terrible and unwatchable it's amazing how cute girls can change the way the world looks
