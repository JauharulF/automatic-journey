<START> i never ever ever thought i'd write the above four words but actually she's the highpoint of this little flick br br as the movie was packaged when i rented it it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn't have her medication which keeps her stable it sounded like a cute concept for years all we ever saw of spelling was as donna martin in 90210 and an endless parade of dull lifeless tv movies it sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little and considering that with her tv success and her rich daddy she couldn't have any financial reason to do this movie i figured she took the part because this must be a low budget jewel br br wrong br br instead spelling's part is small and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines when she's not on the screen the movie crawls so badly i could've sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape this would've worked so much better if spelling's storyline had dominated and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and phil the least irritating kidnapper
<START> the best british comedy film ever for years english comedy television programs have turned into films and have flopped 'are you being served ' army' the list goes on however the popular dark humoured bbc television show 'the league of gentlemen' has managed to not only create a film which has managed to not be a flop but has also managed to be the best british comedy film ever with its dark and horrific twists and turns the league of gentlemen's apocalypse is british talent at its best its intriguing demonic storyline written by the league of gentlemen mark gatiss steve pemberton reece shearsmith and jeremy dyson matches with the gents and guest cameos superb acting this i hope is not the end of royston vasey not after this great success anyway don't think that if you have not seen the league of gentlemen on the telly that you will not understand whats going on its all well explained and by the end of the film you will be happy with the result but you are still left hungry for more mmmm special stuff
<START> a film that reveals the unease of modern men and women in life when confronted to death we are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven religion is declared dead yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death especially since we can push it away for quite a long time what's more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything know everything and do everything that was quite typical of the end of the 20th century today things are changing especially when the president of the united states himself barack obama in a public speech to journalists speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end objective or achievement the film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that was starting to evolve into a truth obsession an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly reachable post modernism had not reached hollywood yet though today it seems to have reached the white house so some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back technically it is possible but the result is not surprising it old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious one has to do with a drug addicted father of a vietnam veteran who commits suicide another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death included another still with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in grade school out of racism sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness it is so naÃ¯ve that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice the film though is interesting but in something quite different the setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of any detail is baroque morbid decadent quite in the style of death in venice or greenaway or some other works of art that deal with making friends with the basic enemy that death is of course that does not save the film but at least that makes it worth watching br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines cegid
<START> i have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched but in my opinion screenwriter shane black lethal weapon kiss kiss bang bang crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming the final action sequence is one of the best i have ever seen in any film the cast in this film crackles davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a sequel samuel l jackson is hilarious as her sidekick mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks if baffles me how anyone could not like this film it packs so many thrills and its so funny the wisecracks in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later in my mind the first matrix film and the long kiss goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90's incidentally shane black made a fortune when he sold this script at the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny it's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance cause they would have witnessed renny harlins best film and davis like you have never seen her before long live the long kiss goodnight
<START> i am a big fan of british films in general but especially gangster movies unfortunately this film was shockingly bad i think its pretty depressing that this film is getting any good customer reviews the idea that this film is gritty and realistic is laughable i have read and heard fist hand quite a lot about the real life events shown in this movie and they have nearly all been glorified with over the top violence etc the only gritty true to life event in the whole film was the range rover murders where some overblown bouncers got rubbed out for messing with people they could not handle this film is a disgrace to british cinema it has no plot and no decent acting and just relies on being violent gritty and realistic as some people like to put it the sort of people who made this film should not be allowed near a budget or film camera just as the sort of people this film is about should not be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent little tale of no consequence
<START> this movie sucks did anyone notice that the entire movie was shot in like 2 rooms there are never any outside shots and if there are its obviously film taken from somewhere else this movie blows hard painful to sit through too stay far away
<START> some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons one for eating one for breathing and the other one for s ting this is not a movie for them br br but for those who enjoy using the brain the whole movie is a metaphor everything is there for a purpose every single detail the coffee mug the red couch everything is a underestimated masterpiece br br it is hilarious is raw and totally realistic that's how we actually interact it is a royal comedy total causality br br just hang on don't let the first scene shock you hang on and enjoy the show
<START> during world war ii two soviet russian soldiers try to avoid being captured by occupying nazis as they trudge through snowy terrain searching for food and safety if you happen not to like black and white foreign films you may still enjoy in english the ascent director paces the film extraordinarily well despite its being a largely introspective piece of work her untimely death in a car accident made this ms final film unfortunately br br after the opening mission is declared there doesn't seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods but and a changing setting make it unexpectedly exciting leading players vladimir as the spiritually wounded and boris as the physically wounded successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism their allegorical performances under sharp direction provide a memorable and thought provoking take on a familiar story br br 4 2 77 vladimir boris lyudmila
<START> this movie was an absolute waste of time it's nothing but a wanna be gangster movie it contains a very predictable plot my feelings are unsympathetic to the characters and the dialogue is mediocre at best half the time you are looking for something else to do because the movie is that boring since you already know what's going to happen the other half of the time you're desperately hoping the protagonist grows a pair of balls or just ends his life by jumping off a bridge or something also the secondary characters are for the most part one dimensional there's no depth to any of the characters in this movie no depth
<START> wicked little things has an excellent synopsis empty house beside abandoned mine in woods with tragic past family moves into house and strange things begin to happen little creepy children begin to pop up here and there doing creepy little children things but that is where the cleverness and potential fun ends this group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier and now appear roving the woods poor make up with weapons looking for flesh to eat oh i get it this is a ghost zombie movie hmmm while i can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre this just didn't work what was the children's motivation in seeking to devour flesh why did they need weapons did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage giggling because they felt this was going to be a cool scary movie i found that after thirty minutes i felt the familiar resignation that i had just wasted my time on another modern crap fest while the acting was good and the setting cinematography of good quality as well the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether a bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised rodents br br this movie is not scary and while i can appreciate the story perhaps have even enjoyed it if i had read it instead of watched it i still have to say that wicked little things is more accurately called wicked little turd
<START> one day a red alley cat is fed up of being kicked by people and attacked by dogs and muses that life would be better if he were a skunk he then paints himself black with a white stripe down his back and adds a bit of limburger cheese to make him stink at first life couldn't be better for him the dog flees and the butcher abandons his shop letting the cat walk off with a pile of meat just as he is thinking everything is perfect he is noticed by a real skunk not just any skunk but the overly amorous le pew mistakes the poor cat for a female skunk and pursues him thinking his protestations are just shyness our poor cat thinks he has escaped when he throws a skunk skin from a tall building so that will think he is dead at first it seems to work but as he sneaks off sees him and instantly forgets the dead skunk in the end the cat realises he was better off being kicked and attacked than being lusted after by a randy skunk there is a nice ending for the skunk too when his wife finds out what he has been up to br br this was a fairly funny introduction to le pew who back then was just overly amorous but now looks like a randy sexually harassing stalker although he was punished for his behaviour in the end
<START> linda lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater chuck traynor i don't understand how having sex with a dog which is animal abuse as well can be found to be entertaining or funny linda lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings we call ourselves civilized however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized
<START> this is the most energetic and entertaining ten minutes of film i've seen in a long time as a film student at nyu where this short has been screened several times i salute jim cox for his astute sense of style and pace for our generation i'm sure i'll see his name later on the big screen hopefully this short will find a market on tv or somewhere so this inspiring work can get the wide distribution it des
<START> as a canadian history major my first thing to say historical facts are not accurate how can a producer do that the deportation of the wasn't in when we see franklin in london but in how can he pass that in the movie the scenes in londo were useless too then for the story for anyone that read les canadians you have the story line right there it's the story of la that witch add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending sure it brought tears to my eyes but that's it then there's the fact it's apparently set up in city but it's mostly shot at the de sure it's a historical site and it's accurate to the time but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in city overall if you're looking for a documentary of new france go get a people's history a real documentary on the history of and new france if you want a love story that will bring you tears a story set up in a wonderful forest watch new france
<START> george cukor is and always will be one of my favorites the unsung hero of his generation nobody mentions cukor in the same breath as john ford howard hawks william wyler or billy wilder and yet look at his filmography from sparkling comedies the philadelphia story adam's rib holiday psycho melodramas gaslight a double life a great semi western heller in pink tights not to mention my fair lady or travels with my aunt he was at the service of his actors he never put himself in front of the camera i feel a certain tenderness watching rich and famous flashes of the old master still very much in evidence candice bergen gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the wonderful comedian she was about to become jacqueline bisset is a throwback to the days of greer garson and loretta young and hart bochner steps in teasing us promising something spectacular that will eventually materialize in 1989 with apartment zero meg ryan as bergen's daughter is already meg ryan as tired as the formula is it remains a cukor film and for what i gather one of almodovar's favorite movies
