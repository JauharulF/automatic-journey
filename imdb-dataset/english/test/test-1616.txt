<START> the title of my summary pretty much covers my review br br this is to me what teenage mutant ninja turtles was to someone 5 years older while i missed out on that little pop culture wave i embraced the toy line and t v series that was mighty max with both arms br br you wanna know how into this i was i went as mighty max for halloween br br thank god for the internet thanks to last week i was able to watch this great show from my childhood for the first time in over a decade br br i'm watching this right now having just been blown away by recognizing rob paulson of animaniacs and am also loving the celebrity humor in tar wars 4 minutes in and they have already mentioned by name clint eastwood governor arnold dustin hoffman john wayne and ace ventura hells yeah br br damn it is only upon writing this that i realize there is no way in hell i can give this series anything less than a perfect score any imperfections have been lost in the fog of time br br this is my childhood this is awesomeness this is the mighty one
<START> as a fan of author and humorous books of which van is not the best one i was looking forward to see this film i didn't catch it in cinema though and after seeing it on to tv i'm terribly happy i resisted buying it on video out of a good book they managed to make one of the worst movies in dutch film history all the good parts have been left out the story is changed not to its benefits all humour has been cut out what's left is a bad acted over dramatic non consistent film that i do not want to watch again ever br br i with this result and am happy that jan did a hell of a better job on topper sorry go see that one
<START> it's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so so film noir there just isn't a lot to say about it it is not memorable enough to add to your collection and i have a considerable amount of noirs br br paul henreid plays a tough guy in here he's not one i would think of to play this kind of role but he's fine with it he's a fine actor anyway br br everything including the cinematography is okay but not memorable one thing that stood out the abrupt ending that was a surprise it was also a surprise to see this under the heading hollow triumph i've never seen the film called that it's always been called scar br br if you read about a tense film noir etc don't believe it tense is not an accurate adjective for this film
<START> why did i buy this movie on dvd well the short answer would be i really don't know as for the longer version it pretty much comes down to the fact that i genuinely like ali and she plays alicia in this br br now does ali give a genuinely good effort in this movie i must say that it is one of the better and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress i am very much looking forward to see her in action when better material will be available br br this being said this movie was terrible and my score is given based on this 1 star for not being the worst movie i've seen 1 star for the performance of ali and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars there are worse movies for that br br ja rule should stick to rapping not my favourite rapper to say the least but some seem to like him and if he is contained there i would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scene br br ving rhames ah man wallace what are you doing here you used to be cool man just because michael caine is a fiercely brilliant actor who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good you don't have to copy him ving br br the rest of the semi big names in the cast it's ok there are bills to be paid and we all have to do things we're not proud of time to time br br the movie itself it so massively flawed it's pretty difficult to know where to start it's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together as were the director to say we need to tell this and we need to tell that there is a story unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or within it to say the least the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the time br br to sum up in one word
<START> ever since i first played it in 1998 goldeneye has been one of my favourite video games in fact i recently bought an n64 purely so that i could own it and play it more often the game is pretty much near perfect the single player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in bond's shoes with varied mission objectives convincing weapons and great level design even though the enemies' artificial intelligence is pretty basic by today's standards that only adds to appeal the method of obtaining cheats completing levels within a strict time limit was also innovative when the title was released and even now i still haven't cracked some of them br br the game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players and while this isn't as advanced as the combat simulator in the game's sequel perfect dark it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of rc fire
<START> okay my question who's the idiot that wrote this movie giving it the same name as dean awesome book its terrible nothing like the book you got the dog and the watcher but there the similarities end might be good if you haven't read the book though but it disappointed me really br br they should make a new one and let koontz write it now that would be a good movie i'll say it again this movie disgusted me absolutely disgusted me it was terrible it was absolutely nothing like the book i would never again watch it
<START> the standard bearer of all movie serials the definite good guy flash gordon versus bad guy ming the merciless though the special effects seem awful by today's standards for 1936 they were top notch but the essence of the story is the battle between flash gordon buster crabbe versus emporer ming of charles middleton crabbe and middleton are terrific in their parts and the supporting characters playing dale arden dr princess aura prince vulcan and the rest are all very good this serial is far superior to the 1980 movie basically because crabbe is much much superior to sam j jones as flash gordon br br this serial is the standard bearer for all movie serials no question about it
<START> this film is a sleeper because rod steiger's is the only big name in the credits yet all of the supporting actors fit well with his character it was fitting that in his last film rod steiger reminded us once more of his inventive power as an actor he portrayed a grandfather's impulsiveness stubbornness and acceptance of the end of life in a characteristically individual and convincing performance because his character was close to death the story brings us closer to the most precious things granted to us the privilege of life relationships with family members and the empathy of those who care for us his search together with his grand daughter for one of his sons provided enough suspense to keep me waiting expecting a highly charged climax such as the meeting of two long separated elderly lovers who were also on the cusp of death in forever young i wondered how the meeting would be staged and how tightly my emotions would be wound by the time he and his granddaughter reached the end of his quest i was delighted to find that the story brought more than i expected the delightfully satisfying climax brought for me a greater appreciation of the value of the precious gifts of life love and family that are enjoyed today by me and by all of us
<START> the people who don't like this movie seem to have some academic vendetta against it those of us who don't hold the original can totally enjoy it br br my husband who had never seen the original said i don't want to see a girly movie i assured him that the women is just a great movie not a girl movie he had a great time he was very glad to have gone and enjoyed it more than the boy movie we saw the day before burn after reading br br spoiler i even think the new ending is better maybe not quite as fun but it was beautiful at first i couldn't understand why they had made certain changes to the plot br br but when i got the end and debra messing gives birth and brings the first male into the movie i cried that's one thing to love about men Â they are our sons
<START> i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute a feel good saturday night movie i wasn't expecting anything great figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised br br the dialogue was pitch perfect most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely ash christian was perfect his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see he could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character it was wonderful to see jonathan again i didn't know what he would do after ashley fink is gem a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work br br there are moments in the film that could have used some work but all in all not a bad time at the cinema my friend described it as a gay angus napoleon dynamite but it's something more than that it's a character study into what it's like to grow up gay in a small town the pain is there but the humor behind that pain that only age can make clearer is magnified i look forward to seeing more of ash christian ashley fink and jonathan soon
<START> one minute into the untold and it s already ripped off techniques from the blair witch project and predator does this mean we ll be seeing lots of trees we sure will will we be seeing an austrian bodybuilder blowing things up well this film has the budget of a tvm so the answer is a resounding no does anyone like these soft porn shows like bedtime stories good because there s a scene in this that resembles these type of shows unfortunately the only thing you see is cellulite do you like it when the screen fades to black during a tvm great because this happens between every scene in the untold in fact it happens during every scene too did you enjoy millionaire a major fraud fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded major charles ingram the contestant who tried to swindle the show out of one million pounds seriously one of the characters looks like major ingram i kept expecting him to say it s bear it could be a bear but it might be a bigfoot cough cough yes it s a bigfoot cough it s definately a bigfoot cough yes i m going to shoot it final answer chris br br oh and have i mentioned that all the above are the good bits br br the untold isn t the worst bigfoot movie i ve ever seen that accolade firmly goes to night of the demon which i saw over twenty years ago and i think i ve only seen less than a dozen films that are worse in all of that time but that said the untold is still a very poor film in just about every aspect especially editing as some other reviewers have pointed out it feels like whole chunks of the film are missing while there s other bits where scenes are spliced together in the wrong order this is a really bad film that deserves far less than its rating of 5 1 i give it 3 out of ten and i m being very kind
<START> madonna has been rocking the boat for over 20 years and with that comes a lot of experience obviously and a lot of knowledge she was never the one to think about yesterday au contraire she seemed to know what is going to be popular tomorrow she bravely takes all the new trends technologies and incorporates them into her own acts her world tours have never been 'average' when madonna performs she gives 120 everything is bigger better theatrical and meaningful she takes inspirations from east west and makes then unique everything is given a deeper meaning and the confessions tour is not different from the very beginning you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair she starts with bang then she does brave circus poses on a horse high up in the sky she does everything she can to entertain you she remakes her own songs giving them a modern feel she sings on a disco cross she almost comes in the middle of the stage and with her amazing dance crew that know no dimensions of fear the show is absolutely more than you bargained for it's a spectacle an audio visual orgasm that cannot be put in words lucky are the ones who actually experienced seeing madonna on stage pushing fifty she is still in an incredible form recent sticky and sweet tour is even more ground breaking which proves nothing else that madonna was is and ever be the one and the only queen of pop
<START> this film was probably the best scary film i've seen in years chilling might be a more accurate description the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept since noone truly knows that answer you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry the rest of the cast were somewhat shaky however since the focus was on sara novak carly pope her performance anchored the movie the at times poor acting abilities of her costars were not an issue since it was not their performances that fuelled this movie thankfully watch this movie you should enjoy it br br t
<START> with all the potential for a good movie in its gorgeous settings cast and cinematography this film's lacklustre script leaden pace and wooden performances produced only a major disappointment with decent direction editing and musical score this could have been a good movie perhaps a dark version of blake edward's '10' instead of a weepy version of ron howard's
<START> luis bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was obscure to me my first experience with him was the discreet charm of the often considered his greatest work with which i became so frustrated and bored that i eventually shut the tape off likewise belle de jour which is almost certainly his best known film and also generally considered one of his many masterpieces didn't interest me very much at all i didn't hate it like i did discreet but i didn't like it third i saw l'age d'or finally i had gotten somewhere fourth los olvidados also good still neither l'age d'or nor los olvidados blew me away great films but not masterpieces br br is my fifth bunuel and i like it just a tad more than those other two it is about a priest from spain now in mexico who refuses to live in the kind of luxury most priests live in he wants to be more like jesus leading the life possible he's also willing to forgive everyone for anything and to suffer without protest i'm pretty sure bunuel does not sympathize with the character and sees him as rather self righteous however i only assume that because of my knowledge of the director whose most famous quotation is thank god i'm still an atheist which he apparently said in an interview over this very film i get this information from john baxter's book about bunuel if you're interested the interviewer who dragged those words from bunuel's mouth must have been himself confused about one who was more predisposed to believe in religious conviction who also knows nothing about bunuel might see the priest as a heroic figure this is especially true if that viewer has his her own criticisms of organized religion the priest may be somewhat self righteous but he seems to be basically a good man when he harbors a violent prostitute in his room in order to protect her and presumably to save her soul people begin to find out and assume that their relationship is sexual his superiors assume the same and punish him for it later on he suffers even worse punishments from clerics
