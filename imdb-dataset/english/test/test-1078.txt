<START> the intricate plot great visuals the world's greatest car chase ever make this movie a lot of fun to watch the beautiful charlize theron adds to the enjoyment the sound score is outstanding add to all this an energetic cast that also seems to be having a lot of fun making the movie
<START> i just do not see what is so bad about this movie i loved this movie i thought this movie was the best film in the series though part 3 is the best in the series i still gave this film 10 out of 10 because it is great i don't see what everyone hates this movie who would not want to see just a little bit of critter action i wished that brad brown would of appeared in this one because it might of made it a little better those who like a little bit of drama because wait i won't tell you you will just have to watch it this film also contains a few popular actors who are i won't tell you because i hate it when people give spoilers so i do not want to be one of those people well i guess that is all i have to say about this movie
<START> andy lau and lau ching wan are both superb in johnny to's tautly directed crime thriller which puts most western efforts to shame think of it as the hong kong 'heat' only better everything about the film screams class from the performances to the soundtrack the cinematography to the script the tone remains serious throughout but the film has a nice line in black humour friendship and romance at it's heart sure it gets a little preposterous later on but it would be a hard hearted viewer who didn't find something to love about this movie thank god hollywood hasn't yet re made and ruined a classic do yourself a favour and see this film
<START> monday october 02 2006 so i got together with my dad as i always do we ordered some japanese take out turned off the lights and pushed play i'm an avid fan of horror movies however the cavern released on dvd this october was most certainly a let down it seemed promising meeting all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine drawn out beginning with antagonistic character present a cannot be omitted sex scene and the all too familiar pre spook when they spook you unexpectedly but it turns out to be the idiot buddy then finally when it got down to the nitty gritty i was ready for some real gore action the director i admit was keen of course you would have to be to fill in an entire 81 minutes with people running back and forth in a space about wide it all begins when some college bound get together for yet another cave dive they all seem like seasoned pros very serious and spiritual about the whole cave experience this time they bring a new by along some annoying photographer too blinded by his national geographic cover to understand the full dangers of cave diving as they descend deep into what they call hell pit they soon realize that they are not alone in the chasm of death i will politely leave out any spoilers if you are naive enough to not heed my advice and avoid wasting your time although the atmosphere and background music was spooky and there was sure a lot of blood and gore when the moments approached to witness some actual dismemberment it was more like watching porn without the full frontal the camera work was purposefully dark and sketchy i guess the director used it for effect i suppose the thing i like most about the movie were the moving characters they deserved acadamy awards for those touching bickering scenes i almost shed a tear when they finally got it a tear for joy if you like dry horror soft porn and you hated braveheart then this is the right movie for your next saturday night
<START> does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents one edition featured charles bronson robbie coltrane being interviewed about his new movie br br it's about a man an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner br br and after what next for bronson br br we're using a new angle my family don't get wiped out but i go after creeps just the same br br this accurately describes the evil that men do it's a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn't down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained br br bronson is a retired hit man who isn't giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of the doctor not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture it's never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents br br as you may guess it's a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctor's sister being a lesbian so some t a can be included br br in many ways it's like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday afternoons believe me this movie won't be shown until well after the watershed
<START> i don't know where this movie was shot but because it was shot on location it has the authenticity that this story deserves it is the story of a young english woman who is taken prisoner by the japanese in southern asia at the beginning of wwii with a group of other english women there is no prison camp for women so they are forced to march for months from place to place because the japanese don't know what to do with them the courage and resilience of the english women and the bravery of the australian soldier who tries to help them is the core of the movie this movie is very long maybe 10 hours so you can watch it as it was shown on pbs as a series which actually adds to the feeling of the endless journey this woman makes from england across this remote island and finally australia story cinematography location and actors combine to make this a movie not to miss my only question is why this hasn't been released on dvd
<START> i saw this a good while ago but i just cant get over it i have looked everywhere to try and find out where i can get a copy of it but i have not been able to get a hold of it i really reccomend this movie and if anyone has any info about how i can get a copy then let me know thanx
<START> saw this at newport beach film festival the other day the film is really exceptional the crowd i went with all loved it funny poignant and great acting i'm tired of the tried and true hollywood romances who can relate david max is really amazing as the sure and true lover of the ultra screwy grace natasha who is also excellent when max falls for grace we believe it why because love at first sight is crazy and we're dealing with two lost and maybe not so crazy souls also of note are diaz as hector and rosanna arquette as a sexless sexy neurotic both roommates of max and grace before they embark on their trip to wi and finding themselves don't miss this one its something special p s the soundtrack led by kevin of bare naked ladies fame is really super super cool as well
<START> this isn't a bad movie it's fun to watch for the first time however it has absolutely no replay value at all when you try to watch it again it gets so boring you have to turn it off i give this movie a 6 out of 10
<START> tobe hooper fresh off mainstream success with 'poltergeist' aims for the skies this time around is an adaptation of colin wilson's 'the space vampires' the script by dan o' bannon and don varies a bit i was told the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by earth a few weeks after the films release so i've read br br the story concerns a shuttle mission commander by steve railsback sent to investigate comet as it passes by earth all goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet the team investigates the massive structure and discovers bat like creatures looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too in odd stasis coffins the crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow br br a bit later the ship returns to earth but no contact can be made by nasa and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission upon docking with the churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight but the three humanoids remain however it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown br br soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her if you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust the goal of the three is to drain enough of the essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well br br thankfully the commander survives re entry in the pod crash lands in texas no less and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed london dry of their souls br br tobe hooper of 'the texas chain saw massacre' 1974 does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date the production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry production designer john fresh off 'the bounty 1984 ' uses every bit of four stages at studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such cinematographer alan hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'star wars vi return of the 1983 and three consecutive james bond episodes hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects oscar winner john innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'star wars' 1977 manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers heck even maestro henry mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci fi horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel in the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of steve railsback and newcomer mathilda may vampire queen railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like nobody's business that comes in hand as his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on his soul gorgeous french actress may doesn't have a heck of a lot of lines were there more than ten but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence job accomplished and where do i sign up to be victim i really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clichÃ©s and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable almost everything is accounted for here bats their true form resembles a large bat coffins the stasis fields resemble these transformations they scan your mind and can be anything massive sexual appeal miss duh not to mention they even include the old standby stake through the heart this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart the only thing they didn't touch on was religion but i think that the vampires using the cathedral at the end as home base might just be a bit of a wink and a nod br br in short yeah right 800 words later is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles the effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged at least at the time and horror and sci fi fans engaged 4 of 5
<START> calling was good but it could have been great the concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that might have been explored in future unfortunately the writing and an actor let the show down br br the writing wasn't too bad but there were holes in episode 13 drop dead gorgeous an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim this was so toxic and killed so quickly the victim had no time to run or even scream for help yet there was no plausible explanation for how the killer obtained such a powerful poison br br in episode 15 the getaway the off duty policeman responded unrealistically in the second diner scene he meekly tells the robber to drop the gun and when she doesn't follow the order and in fact turns the gun in his direction he allows it to turn into a standoff and then escalate into a hostage situation Â the very situation he'd been warned about his response should would have been to shoot the robber when she failed to follow his order and upon her turning the gun on him there are other faults in the stories but i'll leave it with these two examples in spite of the writing faults i did like the show br br the other problem i had was that i just could not accept eliza dushku in this roll in my opinion she is too inexperienced and lightweight to carry this part she never walked anywhere she marched and far too often she came to an abrupt stop on her mark br br she also lacked any really emotional facial expression or intonation she either has a pensive look or a cute smile rarely are other emotions apparent when she tries to appear dramatic she begins her line looking away and turns her eyes to her fellow actor or alternatively she begins her line looking at her opposite and then looks away both are annoying when done as a replacement for true emotion an example of her lack of intonation is in episode 20 two weddings and a funeral during her second wedding speech is devoid of emotion eg hearts in our hearts br br i liked all of the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable with improved writing and a lead change calling might have made it
<START> this wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny entertaining sweet and memorable it's difficult to decide where to start br br from the opening number rainbow connection paul williams's excellent score sung with gusto by kermit d frog which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about throughout the story this is one fun movie br br essentially it's a road trip movie where kermit travels cross country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain along the way our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors comedians singers and musicians who coincidentally are muppets like kermit himself is this how the muppets really started approximately how it happened kermit tells us br br not since it's a mad mad mad mad world has the cameo formula been used so and successfully the aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their odyssey some just blink across the screen but others have very memorable cameos steve martin's amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best puppeteer jim henson's nod to his inspiration edgar bergen is especially touching br br anyone who ever watched the muppets tv show will get to see all of their favorite characters they're all here the puppetry work is magnificent look especially for kermit riding a bicycle how dey do dat in jokes and references to old movies are everywhere but the best one liners are reserved for kermit himself an example when the crooks are terrorizing kermit and piggy she affectionately says to her short green and handsome beau i wouldn't give up this evening together for anything would you uhhh make me an offer i also love the gunfight at the ok corral scene brilliantly absurd silliness br br gotta get movin' right along now but to summarize a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age or movie genre taste highly recommended
<START> craig brewer is now officially a writer director for whom i will see any film by no matter how bad it may look his debut hustle and flow was one of my favorites from that year with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic fallible characters i wasn't quite sure what i would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort the cast seemed great the trailer used music effectively however it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity and fast fortunately black snake moan hits all its marks dead on the acting is astonishing the writing superb and the editing style as well as juxtaposed music riveting the whole way brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption br br the first moment i knew i was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning like he did with hustle and flow brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up the 70's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best from here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both lazarus and rae each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross the editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and wife leaves him for his brother each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that to sex and laz to the bottle only when rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear br br samuel l jackson is fantastic as the older farmer trying to reconcile his life with god and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him there are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of with his captive patient you never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well also the character of rae is not chained up for very long despite what the trailers would have you believe the situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two as for that chained girl christina ricci really shines i never really saw her as anything special but this role is a true breakthrough for her this girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away her nymphomania is not for pleasure but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism mention must also be made of justin timberlake again showing some real acting talent where this guy came from i have no clue but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out br br while not as solid and consistent as hustle and flow moan still ranks equally to it in my mind because when it is on it is spectacular towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with this little light of mine singing out and earlier the interaction between captive and captor when the chain is first introduced shows some top notch work the truly magical moment though is when jackson sings yes that is him throughout like it was terrence howard in hustle the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker if i don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year i won't be surprised what these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of one thing i think i really enjoy with work is the fact that he doesn't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been or how bad life has been everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people we don't have saints here but fallible people looking to right their ship if the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness no one really knows but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could
<START> i have recently become a huge fan of patton i think he's the most deliciously original comedian to come along in ages he is refreshing and fearless in his routines which run the gamut of topics from how much bush sucks to the sleazy exploits of 1970s producer robert evans i'm a longtime fan of maria and her wide eyed innocent schizophrenic routine whenever she effortlessly switches her naturally high pitched voice to one that is clipped and throaty i can't help but giggle i liked brian posehn long before i even knew he was on just shoot me and there is something so innately funny about his aging nerd persona all three of these talented unique comedians headline the comedians of comedy a netflix documentary about their u s tour they truly deserve to be stars and this tour gave them the recognition they so richly deserve i thought no i knew i'd like this movie br br but i was wrong instead of the three comics each getting their own routine segments the comedians of comedy is bogged down by meandering and dull documentary scenes that contain no humor no insight nothing of real interest i think there is a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand up routines total in the 109 minute movie what a rip off come on is anyone really interested in seeing our stars banter in their rv where's the humor in seeing posehn in an arcade and a comic book shop does anyone find random diner scenes particularly funny if this movie couldn't have shown our comics strutting their stuff at least make it about what life is like on the road it's not even about that worst of all the comics never appear to be having real fun admits how bored he is doing a radio interview posehn sheepishly admits to how much he sucks at giving a tour of his home and nervously improvises every time the camera is pointed at her and her humor there is only sporadic br br sheesh these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional amazingly crafted humor that is a refreshing change of pace from the brainless entertainment of mainstream comics like dane cook instead we have to sit through their mundane everyday routines on the road in a substandard bore of a movie whose quality could easily be surpassed by any student film if you can locate any of or performances on dvd by all means do their talent should be a joy to behold not a chore like it is here
<START> if this film won the lumiere award for best french language film then what kind of garbage is coming out of france these days br br the subject matter is an important one how the african economies are kept as economic hostages by the international organizations that are supposed to be helping them namely the international monetary fund and the world bank about 40 of the governmental budgets of several african nations go to payment of western debt while their people suffer from disease and illiteracy br br but the subject matter was treated in the most dry manner that could be conceived by man dryer than the sahara that surrounds the country of in which this film takes place more monotone and action lacking than any documentary i've ever seen and i'm a fan of the genre one witness after another comes forward in this trial that is captured on film that condemns the world bank imf some critics may site the colorful visual asides within the film but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen they belonged better in a coffee table book than in this film br br even the characters in the film say something like this trial is boring and when will it be over everyone in the theater laughed were those people on the screen reading our minds br br danny glover had a brief appearance in this film it is a televised movie within and it was set within morocco or it was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti western i've ever tried to avoid the only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was where a caucasian bad guy accidentally shoots an african woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse whatsoever perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the world bank and how it is unintentionally killing africans br br and one last technical parting shot the subtitles were difficult to read with so much light colors on the screen and not enough black outline to the subtitles themselves br br i've already summarized the movie for you don't be fooled by the hype no need to see this film you'll never get these two hours back in your life
