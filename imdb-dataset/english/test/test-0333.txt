<START> the only thing good about this movie is the artwork on the promotion poster by h r geiger anti nuke protesters who all looked like punk rockers of the late 1970s and somehow became non violent except for their leader splatter occupy the cities fraternity boys descend on the to do some violence on them and turn them into victims bad acting and bad plot then descends on the real victim you the viewer i gave this a 2 because a few sexual scenes at least give it mst3k potential br br
<START> why this film was only released in 4 states is beyond me i thought this film was a divine story the name says it all seeing other people this movie has more logic than laughs which i suppose is why it works so well common sense also makes an appearance in what would seem to be another puerile sex comedy alice is getting her feet frozen in the cold when she feels irrationally about the way she might perform for her fiancÃ© not just sexually but as a partner and friend etc this starts what seems to be an almost archetypal journey for the both of them one fling after another leads to trouble as if it wasn't a bad idea from the start witty dialogue and comic set ups make this one funny as hell nicholson and mohr set the tone of the film early on and keep the promise they anticipate other highlights are lauren graham andy richter and helen slater in her first theatrical film in 10 years climax begins to take an insane turn but a simple ending makes this one far more enjoyable than most movies today mohr fans will see something different in his ed character and fans of helen slater will enjoy her shiny moments of a quick but excellent come back any richter takes home the award for most moralistic character romantic and funny or just plain fun seeing other people is a gem which needs to be noticed
<START> out to sea was a great movie i expected comedy and from about 10 minutes into the film to the end there was comedy and laughing points jack and walter are great together and the addition of rue made it a wonderful movie that should be seen over and over again
<START> tourist trap is a genuinely spooky low budget horror film that will surely satisfy horror fans it contains extremely strange atmosphere and there are some quite unnerving moments of total dread and fear some scenes are downright bizarre for example there is one scene when chuck connors sits down to have dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and starts conversing with him before its head falls off there is very little gore but the violence is quite strong for pg rated horror film the mannequins look very sinister and the climax is horrifying david schmoeller returned to make several other genre films including puppet master and netherworld still tourist trap is definitely his best horror film so if you want to be scared give this little gem a look br br rated pg for brief nudity violence and profanity
<START> i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous although a musical i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well as far as her dancing i think she was excellent even betty grable pretty much endorsed rita's dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it betty grable was an excellent dancer the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she's also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever you'll have to watch the film to find out
<START> too bad they showed palm trees that could not be more inaccurate for connecticut in october this was filmed in new zealand this martha case had been for 20 25 years her family worked hard to keep it alive and when mark decided he did not want to be remembered only for his involvement in the nicole simpson case which could have been to his reputation if it already hadn't anyway he followed along as the police tried to get enough information to write a book with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships martha formed unattended boys coming of age without a mother around to help and a dad who was always looped br br plus the fact that they portray the real martha as if she were a movie star she was a cute sweet girl next door type other than that the other characters were really great especially jon foster and toby moore who played as michael and tommy respectively they were good as well the costumers had to keep it all in the 70s look and back up to the 90s br br it kept my interest even when i caught on about the guy
<START> you may be interested to know that barricade was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a year before alice faye's popularity reached such a high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed it fared modestly ok at the box office br br faye refers to a murder during her nightclub stint in new york city and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the film was to start instead it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence including a complete song number by faye was never filmed however the rest of the story is pretty much intact and made release of the film possible at a running time of 71 minutes br br a tired looking warner baxter is too old to be believable as faye's romantic interest and is merely perfunctory as the broken down reporter audiences today would be offended by the depiction of chinese using fractured english phrases like me make noisy key luke is one of the chinese loyalists but plays his role in a low key straightforward way arthur treacher is all but invisible and yet gets fourth billing on screen due to editing changes in the story originally joseph schildkraut had a role in the film but his part was eventually edited out br br a mishmash of a film that will serve as entertainment only for the most die hard alice faye fans who will get a chance to see her in a dramatic role albeit a weak one charles winninger is totally wasted as a kindly man running the american consulate br br despite all the weaknesses there are a couple of scenes involving narrow escapes that are effectively played and karl freund's b w photography is top notch
<START> i loved complete savages why did they cancel it anyway they should have made a second season and so on god they always cancel the good shows and leave all the boring stuff nothing interesting at tv since complete savages is gone this show was a great idea a single firefighter father with five crazy sons and a lazy dog each and every one of them has his own madness in that house tj is always the kid always the smaller one kyle rocks he breaks everything he touches he's always on detention he's always doing the wrong stuff but still he's so funny by all the things that he does sam is the smart one he's always shy and stupid when it comes to girls finally he ends up by dating angela chris is the sports guy who doesn't have much to do with school studying and stuff like that he's always funny and finally jack the rock of the show the oldest of all the macho guy the rock star but still as crazy as everybody else nick is helpless with these guys oh and i almost forgot uncle jimmy he's the man he's like a 30 year old kid he's like doing the same stupid things that the boys are doing i always wondered how did he end up by being a firefighter and the dog is the image of all the savage family the thing is this show had everything to become something really big it had everything man but of course they canceled it
<START> this movie turned out to be better than i had expected it to be some parts were pretty funny it was nice to have a movie with a new plot
<START> my my my peter cushing and donald pleasance must have been desperate for work to have lent their talents to this turkey a horribly muddled story about satanism in modern day greece land of the minotaur aka the devil's men is a misfire on more or less every level imaginable it has precious few scares always a slight flaw for a horror movie don't you think weak performances countless scenes where characters foolishly wander off alone or turn down the opportunity to remain in the safety of a group and some rather irritating editing techniques which add nothing whatsoever to the proceedings i got prematurely excited at the prospect of cushing and pleasance working together 17 years after the flesh and the fiends but this film isn't worth getting remotely excited about it's a huge let down and rather an embarrassment for its much leads br br in a remote region of greece outsiders such as tourists and archaeologists keep going missing and local priest father donald pleasance suspects that something sinister is afoot he writes to his friend new york private eye milo kaye costas asking him to fly out to greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery in the meantime three more visitors beth ian nikos and tom robert who are all personal friends of father go missing while snooping around nearby greek ruins milo eventually arrives in greece but is initially dubious about father beliefs that the missing people have been snatched for satanic sacrifices milo and father are also joined by laurie peters the girlfriend of missing man tom together they uncover the activities of a minoan devil worshipping cult headed by creepy carpathian exile baron peter cushing these crazed cultists have been sacrificing their victims to a statue of the minotaur furthermore they seemingly cannot be killed by normal means so father has to use a variety of religious artifacts in his fight against them br br land of the minotaur should have been much better than it actually is the plot is so wacky and improbable that it has all the hallmarks of an enjoyably goofy cult camp favourite but the handling is just awful director costas has no idea how to link the narrative together cohesively so the whole thing progresses like it was being made up on a day to day basis he also has no idea how to coax convincing performances from his cast so they are left to embarrass themselves in either dreadfully hammy pleasance cushing or dreadfully amateurish peters performances what's worse is that the narrative makes no sense why would father seek help from a private eye who is utterly flippant about his beliefs how does know that the sacrifices only occur during a full moon how can the minotaur statue speak why is one one of the sacrificial victims instructed during a vision to stab father only to herself be stabbed a few scenes later before getting a chance to carry it out and most baffling of all why does father drag milo halfway around the world to help him when all he needs is a crucifix and and some holy water to dispose of the bad guys these questions and more will pop into your mind during land of the minotaur but alas there are no answers to be had frustrating dumb and disappointing
<START> i never comment on a film but i have to say that this was one of the worst films that i have ever seen i feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students but this was horrible i did not buy the lead actress and felt i was in acting class with her while she was on film her decisions were very safe and i feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions the direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves the end may have made a little more sense if there was someone narrating the events and not a song i love patsy cline but she her songs appear quite frequently in films maybe the song selection could have been a little more original the song crazy was such a clichÃ© as i said before i never comment on films and have seen my share of good and bad but this was the worst sorry
<START> computing can there be anything more boring sitting in front of a computer all day typing away at some keys all day every day tap tap tapping that's much of the problem with this movie the heroine sits in front of a computer tapping the keys and no matter how many looks of agitation she gives or how much suspenseful notes the composer strikes or how many extreme close ups the director uses there's not much excitement down to the fact that there's few things less exciting than watching somebody on a computer br br there's a few other problems too much of them factual errors regarding how computers work is it possible to hack into a computer that is both turned off and not connected to the internet i guess that when the net was made 10 years ago very few people would understand how computers worked so the screenwriters would have been able to bs at length but since we now live in a global village where nearly every household in the western world has their own computer the audience are certainly very clued up on the factual errors of this movie and of course there's too many instances where someone acts stupid or out of character at crucial times in order to progress the plot which makes the net a very mediocre movie
<START> this movie starts out great and sucks you in most acting is good until patrick swayze with his texas twang everyone else sounds british like even the muslim shows up and proves that he can't act you can live with that until the first fight scene where all they all fall to pieces why does patrick swayze fight baddies with an ax when he just stuck his sword into the ground 5 minutes ago br br there's further of swords a few minutes later and people knowing about other people they shouldn't know about other reviewers mentioned troubled production and it shows br br at the end i just didn't even care about the fight scenes sure the cgi dragon was weak but the storyline was the biggest letdown

<START> if you get the slight enjoyment out of pink floyd's music you will love this movie the score is completely pink floyd and of course the drug element plays a major part in this movie giving you the doubts about life within the weakest moments this movie also touches the heart with the story about love and the people around you there is also a huge connection with the world around you with the environment of a personal island this thing tell me i need ten lines to sum up a movie but i am done that is all you get that is why this movie is a 6 1 which is a major upset to any movie with a score like this take a look at requiem for a dream and the fountain equally good scores for our generation but overestimated
