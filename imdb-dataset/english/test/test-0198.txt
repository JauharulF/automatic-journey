<START> this is a very touching movie this is a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather a villager brings his grandson to the city to get his eyes treated but comes to know that has some rare cancer of eyes and has to undergo an operation and will lose both his eyes the movie is all about the emotions and the turmoil both them go through and how they accept the whole thing the movie avoid any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way though the movie is in marathi language is not a barrier at all it proves that to make good movie you do not need item songs superstars and usual masala excellent performances this is india's entry for oscars 2004 hope it gets the nomination at least would rate 10 10
<START> anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film it's interesting they titled it the hole the production values are good for a short film the hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on i speculate if this was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat many hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience regardless of story and content br br my honest opinion 3 out of 10 for this effort maybe next film will deliver
<START> closet land is an amazing terrifying piece of cinema it features only two actors in a single set but never loses your attention the set design is imaginative and troubling the staging of scenes maintains your attention while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror the acting is outstanding with alan rickman and madeleine stowe having the duty of carrying every scene br br i first saw this film in 1991 soon after it came out on video it didn't play in theaters where i lived not surprising given its political content it should be seen though it features a brilliant staging of the torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in its citizens the country is never named which makes it all the more striking it could be anywhere east west 3rd world 1st world it illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone when government becomes the ruler of the citizens rather than the servant br br madeleine stowe is a children's author who has been dragged from her bed in the night and subjected to terror and torture she finds herself in a room with alan rickman a seemingly pleasant at first it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to go but fear causes her to remain and the terror escalates she is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture the interrogator uses sensory deprivation temporal manipulation confusion auditory manipulation role play and twisted logic to break down the author she is humiliated and forced to endure strenuous bodily positions deprived of food and water br br through it all she refuses to give in to do what the interrogator asks she is told that it will all end if she just signs a confession a simple little act she refuses through it all she employs defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood it is slowly revealed that she was the victim of childhood sexual abuse to survive she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from the abuse these mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and turn the tables on her interrogator she starts attacking his own beliefs and profession forcing him to examine his own life and motives in the end she is free because she maintains the freedom of thought the interrogator is the one trapped by the state br br this movie was made during the height of the cold war apartheid and at a time when the crimes of many governments throughout the world made daily news it is even more timely in a world where enemy combatants are held and interrogated in secret prisons denied legal rights or counsel where ethnic cleansing lays waste to whole societies and humanitarian aid is denied it demonstrates that the individual can stand up to the state or other by refusing to give in to fear and terror
<START> this is one of those movies that is so bad it is awesome it has everything an early eighties movie needs flared pants big moustaches chicks with farrah hair and most importantly ninjas i have a few choice moments to recant for you cole's army buddy has a strange monkey like face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw he gets his ass handed to him about every other scene by the thugs wanting his land so he gets drunk through the entire film at one point his farm workers finally return after being run off by the gangster guy's hired goons and frank i think his name is frank is so moved he shouts to the whole group lets have a cock fight and they all gleefully move to the cock fighting area of the farm to begin the festivities this is funny on every level possible whether you take it dirty or literally it still warms my heart another funny thing is sho kosugi's little grunts and over animated ninja style movements i remember this dude from when i was a kid and he used to say he was the world's only real ninja he had ads in martial arts magazines if i remember correctly my friends and i were a little ninja crazy during the time this movie came out and i can recall seeing it in the local theater many times i was wondering as i watched this on starz last night why every sleazy american gangster type always has a stronghold in the phillipines and wears a white steve martin suit as a matter of fact this guy goes way beyond that in requiring all of his thugs to wear white steve martin suits there is a scene where it looks like 20 steve martin impersonators are attacking a 1970's sears underwear model cole as we wind up for the final battle cole very clumsily breaks into the bad guy's headquarters and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who fires off a round from his pump action shotgun not 30 feet from the bad guys and no one seems to notice or care cole wearing a completely white ninja outfit proceeds to sneakily ascend a staircase then does a flip right into the area where all the bad guys are the second in charge tells him he didn't need to kill everybody as they were expecting him then gives him a ride to the bad guys huge cock fighting arena don't ask me why cock fighting is a huge part of this movie but it is when they arrive cole is still wearing his ninja mask even though everyone involved knows what he looks like without it the final battle is approaching as cole has killed everybody and now sho as i like to call him reveals himself to have kidnapped cole's lady aka frank's wife and they meet in the cockfighting arena you ever saw sho then very politely i might add releases said lady and the battle is about to start they do their bowing and start circling each other both masked by the way when they join in battle it appears cole becomes someone else intermittently ala finishing the game a funny spoof on completing bruce lee's game of death cole eventually comes out on top kills sho who dies with honor by being decapitated and all is well next we see cole after ruining everyone's life is about to split town again but not before foreshadowing the brutal death of a fat guy with a hook hand and then he inexplicably winks at the camera freeze frame credits done
<START> this series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet being a staggering five years in the making one would be hard pressed to expect any less i did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones which is naturally only a minor gripe br br david attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative leaving enough room for one's imagination and well spaced out so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery if you get the opportunity try not to watch a translated version of this series br br a definite must see for anyone interested in the intricacies of our blue continents and easily the best documentary on this subject i've ever seen
<START> good actors good director well acted well directed but where's the movie did they have an script or just improvised it all at least it is a short length movie only 80 minutes including credits nothing seems to happen in this film nothing at all a couple of small time drug dealers caught in small time troubles but you'll never get a clue of what's happening nor even what are they talking about in some sequences of the movie tons of f 's and motherf 's but nothing else br br for the people who love abel ferrara's films such as the funeral 'r xmas is going to be a big disappointment as it's been for me what was he thinking about did he really think that this was a good movie and if he didn't then why did he made it
<START> while the new pride prejudice film is gorgeous to view and the soundtrack is lovely we are not seeing jane austen's pride and prejudice the film is for some reason set back in the early rather than the regency period where the novel is set as scholars have long shown the estate is ram shackled and looks like cold comfort farm yet the in the novel are gentry class they own a farm but the pig does not walk through the house nor is the of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home scenes are re set from the novel and lest we forget jane austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason for example the film puts the big darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a temple as opposed to inside the collins' why did jane austen put it in the because while lizzy and darcy speak with total if brutal honesty to each other in this scene the have never shared an honest word why the rain and the outdoor proposal it looks like jane eyre meeting rochester and when elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama one expects her to cry heathcliffe at any minute austen has been judy dench is a great actress but lady catherine is supposed to be tall and striking the petite tom hollander is a brilliant actor but mr collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy looking which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor lizzy is matthew is another favorite of mine from mi 5 on a e in p p however he is more the young heathcliffe never smiling though austen observes in the novel that darcy smiles at lizzy quite a bit and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust and much of austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech mr has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why darcy would have him as a friend and why jane bennet would love him the bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear it deviates from jane austen's novel so much that any student who watched it thinking she could substitute viewing for reading would fail
<START> i couldn't spoil this piece of crap if i wanted to after watching dark harvest 1 i thought this has got to be the worse movie ever made then i watched dark harvest 2 and that made 1 seem a little better then i watched dark harvest 3 or tried too the only thing i have to say is when is this going to end very bad acting and really bad special effects the only good thing about this movie was the boob shot don't waste your time of money on this piece of crap and now i have to write 3 more lines to get this to submit i was going to sing a song but i can't think of any right now but the movie finally ended though it had an ending that might mean they are going to make another one of these
<START> this is a rip off of already crappy hollywood movies like scream and i know what you did last summer the story is classic some high school students tries a prank on the asthmatic misfit but something goes wrong terribly wrong when you watch the movie you know what'll happen before it happens all the time not good if a movie tries to be scary the actors are quite ok and the girls are cute after all they're asian so i'll give it two out of five on the
<START> young ambitious nurse ms rosie is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere during the course of 3 days she encounters strange happenings even a patient in her bedroom watching her yet she still stays the mental patients are all a little eye rolling by the judge but my favorite was the old crazy biddy rhea macadams the storyline is okay at best and the acting is surprisingly alright but after awhile it's gets to be a little much but still it's fun quirky strange and original br br note the thing inside the basement is hardly horrifying so the title is a little bananas
<START> lance henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a b movie even in this case starring along side charles napier master control program and joe don baker as always he does a great job of being the bad guy but the plot is just bad don't even get me started about the ending and the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty is it just me or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute also anytime glass is broken in this movie the editing is so anti phenomenal lastly after watching this i figure david warner is dying for tron 2 0 to finally get the green light br br unfortunately for this will be the third movie i give the rating of 1 10 joining iron eagle iv and no mercy
<START> despite a silly premise ridiculous plot devices and low budget tourist trap br br manages to be striking an inventive beautifully scored film a must see you have to throw rationality out the window to fully appreciate what the director was trying to do if you can manage that you will be in for a pleasant surprise also take note that this is one of the few semi classic horror films that wasn't spoiled by numerous sequels
<START> i bought this on vhs as terror hospital and when i got home i checked imdb and was like omg it's the legendary nurse sherri so here's another one from al adamson who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about film making since the blood of dracula's castle days where that earlier effort is a more or less totally lump this one mixes it up a little adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid the incompetence sure half of the movie is a blind post op football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind or nurse sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork or a wee bit of abstract student film quick cutting to go with the pulsing blob effects in the possession scene or the most gratuitously half hearted topless bit ever or god knows what else i forget to be honest as dumb ass pieces of sh t go this one runs toward the high end congrats al
<START> awww i love this the tale of the cat and the moon doesn't really need an synopsis as that's what it is the cat chasing the moon to a spanish poem it's the artistry that's interesting in fact there was this animated short called the fan and the flower that was an academy award winner last year 2005 yeah almost same thing which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off br br but this is a really good short with stark black white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction if you believe cats are poetry in motion see this and you'll believe it more br br also it has such a touching end br br polarisdib
<START> when i first heard that the subject matter for checking out was a self orchestrated suicide party my first thought was how morbid tasteless and then a comedy on top of that i was skeptical but i was dead wrong i totally loved it the cast the funny one liners and especially the surprise ending suicide is a delicate issue but it was handled very well comical yes but tender where it needed to be checking out also deals with other common issues that i believe a lot of families can relate with and it does with tact and humor i highly recommend checking out a must see i look forward to its release to the public
