<START> no matter what country your in you have to buy this show sure it is australian and if you ever seen any attempt of our comedy's they pretty much suck but with the they aren't boring forty year old men making bad puns they are a team of people who talk about current affairs pretty much in australia make fun of our crap ads make fun of our politicians and so on br br the guys also had a show in 2002 called which was not as successful as the war which had only started this year so everything they talk about is current news which is really good considering no matter how boring or tragic it is they try to shine some humorous light on things
<START> one word for it hilarious i haven't watched at movie like this in a long time at points in the movie i totally forgot it was a movie i just felt like i was back watching viva la bam or even watching say my own friend going through something like this it was realistic and i liked how bam ryan rake and brandon and the rest of the guys didn't try to hard too actually act they to me were just acting like their famous idiot selves there were a few scenes that i adored more than others like in the shower holy i laughed so hard he honestly was probably my favourite character besides he really in my opinion made the movie just a bit more hilarious it's basically a must see for any fans of the crew
<START> the marriage of an upscale new york city couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out it took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door a neighbor tells us the busy distracted husband takes on the motherly responsibilities and grows closer to his son but soon the wife returns highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic familial unit with young justin henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between dustin hoffman and meryl streep but the dynamics are intriguing and involving and director robert benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness marvelous classical music canny editing and surefire bits of humor streep's character is designed to be a cold self centered witch but i was ready to feel a lot more for her than benton probably wanted it all has to be painted in terms of black and white good and bad with hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent the film never falters from its preconceived path and very fine acting nearly saves it but i'm not sure where benton was steering the film in the final act and the closing scene is awfully abrupt from
<START> i just watched this film this morning and i found it to be a great showing of the richness of faith babette gave them another way to look at life not a replacement but an enhancement she shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her i see the story of god in here he sent his only son to man man could not possibly give anything that would equal that so for our small sacrifice we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it in this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with a small interpretation of god babette showed them that life and god can indeed be beautiful in it's fullest sense the love that god's son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it even the film is a metaphor it seems slow in the beginning but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end it was truly a feast
<START> during filming was vanessa redgrave taking it was like she was reading from an autocue i've seen more life in a wooden spoon or perhaps that was all part of the character whatever it was very very annoying i kept wanting to shake the screen to hurry her up i read the book a long time ago didn't like much about it except that descent into madness was very well done but i don't think rupert graves showed this very well his acting was all on the surface the connection between his life and is not very well done either but i suspect the attempt is to show the sacrifice soldiers made to enable people like clarissa to continue their vapid lives the film is very bitty and has no real unity to it hated it
<START> this is a hollywood film the credentials of those involved are not revolutionary this film will not change the world however it is well made well plotted and well acted which counts for a lot br br it's the cat and mouse story of a disgruntled former cia assassin who feels betrayed chasing a secret service agent who was protecting john f kennedy when kennedy was killed in dallas the agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992 or certainly in contemporary america this would be assassin mitch leary john malkovich in a tour de force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the president he imagines he has common cause with secret service agent frank clint eastwood at his cool calm good naturedly grouchy best who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the warren commission blamed unfairly leary believes for the assassination of president kennedy the tension is up through some phone calls from leary to leary wanting to keep close but not to betray his location and plans br br rene russo is excellent as lily raines a fellow agent with whom develops a grown up relationship it is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers even if russo is a fair deal younger than eastwood at the time of filming russo is a calm capable agent who is able to go toe to toe with the quick witted in friendly banter it is a nice part for russo allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man the acting by the leads wolfgang peterson's competent direction the thoughtful use of music in plot development and excellent cinematography make this a film i can watch over and over
<START> i'm not sure if this is a comedy or not but i found it pretty comical isobel is possessed by the devil somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that part exorcism and part soap opera you'll at least get some laughs there's the paranoid jealous dad satanic sister valley of the dolls mother and then the cowboy boyfriend all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear isobel it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode but i actually paid to see this instead of the cool head twisting sailor cursing and crucifix humping that regan did in the exorcist you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay loft yeah it's chuck e cheese gone wild so if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending this is your movie
<START> watch it with an open mind it is very different nothing's cutesy about this very well done realistic tale of tarzan the animatronics are well done for '84 christopher lambert was brilliant imitating language and behavior i wouldn't be surprised if he took lessons from jane goodall
<START> i was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite italian directors d'amato has dabbled in everything from horror post apocalyptic to hardcore porn he has touched upon genius a couple of times with films like omega and emmanuelle the last cannibals this documentary is a and informative guide to the films of d'amato he is interviewed throughout with english subtitles rolling across the bottom of the screen the excerpts from his films are narrated by a narrator with english subtitles the documentary proved extra interesting when it analyzed the often censored emmanuelle in america here d'amato the faked snuff scenes in detail and recalls some funny stories in fact good ol' joe is very warm and funny throughout always wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette the one aspect of this documentary is that it spends little time on d'amato's horror films like anthropophagus and the brilliant omega it spends too much time on the erotic cinema and hardly touches the post films but i can't complain it is wonderful to see d'amato get the respect he deserves highly recommended for fans of d'amato may he rest in peace
<START> i find it terribly ironic that left wing hollywood continues to hedge its bets making these awful lukewarm movies that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace it br br if you're a sixties survivor and a committed pacifist and you're hoping for an all out condemnation of war like born on the fourth of july or all quiet on the western front this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers actually question this war or any war or the idea of war they just gripe about having to do another tour br br on the other hand if you're a patriotic american who wants to see a story of courage and honor this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers loves america or even loves the service the way they pout and sulk makes them come across more like suburban teenagers than blue collar tough guys it's not we were soldiers and it's not sands of iwo jima it's not even mindless action and the war scenes are less rambo and more buffy br br ryan philippe so completely cannot carry this kind of movie though he's devastatingly sexy in a rough trade men's room bisexual sort of way it's hard to picture him as a slow talking' texas boy who wants to stand up and be counted this is no sgt croft in the naked and the dead he's more like joel in truman capote's other voices other rooms he can't sell you on the idea that he's been in combat and done his bit or that he wants his woman and wants her right now he fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes looking as if he would much prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from the rear
<START> i feel very strongly that this film was just like waiting to exhale with white females in the 1950's as in waiting to exhale all of the female characters got mixed up with men who were either married or no good the only difference besides the obvious was that there wasn't much humor in this film i would even say that it was tragic only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere hope lange's guy but even then there was conflict in this relationship br br the story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success unfortunately for them romance didn't seem to come easy although they were young intelligent and attractive this movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving suzy parker's character whose obsession of an ex boyfriend leads to tragedy br br this is a must see
<START> i have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years what staying power it has it was funny and creative i wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it it ranks right up there with dink another favorite i was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on rocky and bullwinkle these early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances while the early cartoons didn't address evil very much it was a much gentler and safer time they allowed us to develop our own talents and character
<START> food always makes a good topic in movies as chocolat showed babette's feast is the same type of thing babette stephane is a french cook who flees her native land after the repression of 1871 she moves to a very religious danish village the people in this village simply have no use for joy that is until babette cooks them one of her exquisite meals br br it's not just that this movie deals with bringing fun to a place that has never known it like other scandinavian movies and non hollywood movies in general it shows that a movie can hold your interest without the use of explosions car chases etc this is one movie that you can't afford to miss br br one more thing do you think that the danish word for feast sounds a little bit like
<START> i have no idea what the budget on this movie was but whatever it was they made it work i have seen movies that spend 100x the amount pearl harbor anyone and sucked worse this movie has everything david it naughton in the lead role as adam an average college student who gets wrapped up in a game called the great run by leon this guy rocks a genius with nothing better to do than come up with an elaborate game for a bunch of people to play but he doesn't just pick his friends he has a team of jocks nerds average kids and of course team who are the bad guys but this movie has no black and white there are many shades of gray adam is not the altruistic hero with no faults he treats alex p like crap and flounder is the way he is because of pressures from his dad and a cranky stomach the jocks play dirty but so does everyone else this movie rocks the scene at the factory classic johnny's obese male child can you write a better clue this stuff is gold jerry gold maybe i am from a different generation but i love movies that seem far fetched but still have roots in reality this never happened but it could eeeee eeee easter bunny easter parade oh and watch for a young paul rubens still working on that pee wee character ps that was is hot she must have been one bad actress not to work in hollywood anymore see this movie
<START> i feel really bad for reviewing this movie because i wish that i had only watched it as a concept production the covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen br br the story follows four five teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of a survivors of the salem witch trials they also happen to be a part of the secret sect called the covenant their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life force in small amounts and is highly addictive in theory this would make a pretty good action sci fi at least an interesting teeny flick br br but there were just too many glaring downfalls that don't allow this movie to reach its plot's full potential that acting wasn't good the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues for sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job the movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline or any feel of pacing br br the movie has it's moments but overall was a little disappointing br br a witchy 4 10
