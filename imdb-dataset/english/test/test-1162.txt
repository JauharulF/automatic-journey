<START> dude i thought this movie rocked perfect for just sitting around alone and watching at like 3am with just you and a bottle the whole time you are watching it you are thinking wtf what's gonna happen next dude just get with the chick already alright they are mushrooms this is odd but kinda creepy cool damn this whole movie has an erotic dirty naughty cold evil undertone to it it's subtle dance just keeps you drawn to it you're just waiting for someone to get whacked but damn wtf you get that and then some for the morally enraged stomach it is great running to the toilet to barf material any movie that can get that kinda reaction out of you deserves an award
<START> never posted anything here before but after watching i just felt that i had to write down my thoughts about it br br firstly do not compare this to blair witch this movie deserves far better than that simply put is probably one of the best horror movies i have ever seen and i have seen a lot br br i really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick but as a documentary filmed by a reporter i think named kobayashi and his cameraman without spoiling to much about the plot i can say it that it starts with kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister br br while the story might not be that original in itself what really hooked me with was the incredibly eerie atmosphere if you're looking for cheap scares and seat jumping scenes this movie might not be for you this movie is all about the mood it presents with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense the documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable br br this is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb although not perfect for the general part of the movie far better than in most other movies in this type of genre br br well enough ranting from me i highly recommend to everyone it is suspenseful creepy well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages
<START> a movie theater with a bad history of past gruesome murders reopens of course the bloody killings start anew written directed shot scored and edited with an appalling lack of flair and finesse by the singularly talentless rick sloane who later disgraced celluloid some more with the absolutely atrocious hobgoblins this horrendously ham fisted attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every conceivable way the excruciatingly lethargic pacing the painfully static grainy cinematography there's a stinky surplus of drab master shots featured throughout an annoyingly droning and redundant synthesizer score the flat non direction a tediously talky and uneventful script the groan inducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor the bloodless murder set pieces a pitifully unscary killer he's just some wrinkled up old guy in pasty make up the uniformly obnoxious and unappealing characters a abrupt ending and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninspired cast all ensure that watching this schlocky swill is about as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels drenched with sour vinegar this crud totally lacks the necessary crude charm and sleazy vigor required to be enjoyable junk instead it's just a bland plodding and meandering stiff that never catches fire or becomes even remotely amusing in a so shoddy it's smoking sort of way only a smidgen of nudity and the delightful presence of the always dependable mary woronov as a snarky sardonic secretary provide a little relief from the overall of this lousy loser
<START> i don't know what the last reviewer is talking about but this show is pure entertainment basically 2 dudes are put in competitions at a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios they mix up the scenarios for each show so it is not the same every time the panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call people out or admit it when they recognize game they will break down what the guy did wrong and what they guy did right some contestants are weak some are strong but what happens is always entertaining if you are a guy that goes out you can relate i've seen weak game i've seen strong game and this show is for real no doubt
<START> after seeing naked city and night and the city which is still my favorite dassin i was more than excited to watch his masterpiece o word criterion rififi br br now i am a little bit disappointed about the story br br so i have at least these five questions in my mind br br 1 in the final countdown louis shot from the inside a house the main character tony le he couldn't know if he is still alive or not but he didn't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house with the money to reach his car so of course tony wasn't dead and shot him big br br 2 in another important scene the specialist in cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring which was a part of the robbery a woman which was working for louis in a night bar stupid because before this character wasn't that stupid and of course louis knew directly that tony planned the jewel robbery small br br 3 after the gangsters behind louis murder mario and his wife tony and his best friend joe planned a revenge against louis gang at the same time they don't care for the security of joe's wife and his five years old child of course louis gang kidnapped the son cheap and simple br br 4 the perfect heist of course this is the best 30min long scene in the whole plot without any word spoken in the whole time but was this a perfect heist comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example tony was taken a fire extinguisher to banned the alarm also too simple br br 5 the gang went to the house of mario because they knew however the jewels will be there then they murder mario and his wife and then they are not searching for it no they ran directly out of the apartment and more they not observing the apartment after it so tony can go after a while which was the same day inside to take the jewels big br br over all it's a good movie because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene because of the very good cut the end scene in the car through paris is stunning because of a very good actor called jean because of this black white fever you will get while watching it because of some other reasons too other user wrote about but please don't tell me this is a stunning story
<START> this is the result of the town of california making a home movie and subjecting the rest of the world to it legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey this movie is rightly thought of as a bad movie part comedy part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non actors not acting the plot has something to do with a giant monster being created from the garbage and pollution in the area and going on a rampage the monster which we don't see until the final 20 minutes is rather cool looking but isn't cool enough to warrant watching the preceding hour of boredom frankly even hardened bad movie lovers are going to have a tough time getting through to the end this is a stinker
<START> i have never read the book but had always heard good things about it so when the movie came out i considered going to see it but never did now it has come out on dvd and i have thought of renting for a few weeks now last night i finally picked it up i am very glad that i did br br cinematography was incredible in this movie the scenery etc all made you feel like you were in kabul the acting was all very good although i am sure some of the emotions were lost in the translation and the story itself was good and pure and uplifting yes the story was very sad but at the same time uplifting br br and i will be honest as a white american made me see aside of kabul and afghanistan that i never picture in my mind when i think about it showed me a afghanistan before the taliban showed me a place that was beautiful showed me a place with good hearted people i community that was like a family aside from a few bullies br br anyways i recommend this movie to everyone it is one of the best i have ever seen
<START> oh yes i have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling the acting in this four hour feature is uniformly bad so bad to the point that i find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production could possibly earn a living as an actor i still wonder who did the casting each delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character none appear to have a true relationship family or otherwise with another the direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing were the film editors asleep br br the costumes appear authentic to the regency period but the fabrics look 20th century and colors especially the blue colors are jarring and i don't believe were available in early 19th century fabric except perhaps in silk br br also the hair the men have obvious 1970s haircuts and the women have big hair especially the woman playing anne elliot br br all the female characters young and old are quite lovely but this doesn't make up for the lack of acting abilities the actress playing anne looks as though she is in her forties while anne elliot is supposed to be 27 years old i mean where was the makeup and lighting crew if we were to find the woman playing anne believable she spends much of her time gazing pensively with her eyes at the level of the horizon whether indoors or out i wonder still what that was suppose to convey regret perhaps yes this production is regrettable br br the actress playing louisa was truly appalling she screams squeals giggles and leaps around like an ill mannered twelve year old my apologies to anyone twelve years of age reading this that i found myself eagerly awaiting the moment when she knocks herself out how this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me most would back off when she first opened her mouth to giggle and shriek br br the actor playing captain wentworth portrays someone so bland and colorless one wonders why any woman could pine over him for eight years br br the of the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained how did they get together again not because louisa was in a coma that is certain no there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film br br i rate this production two stars one because it is work and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely the only reason i could watch the entire production is that i was off sick with the flu and i got it from the library br br if you enjoyed the book see the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds i would recommend this film even if you have't read the book
<START> peter o'toole one of our finest actors is magnificent as a reserved school master who is dedicated to teaching young boys he meets a show girl and falls in love the story is one of love and devotion clark adds spirit and sensitivity not too mention a remarkable voice you will enjoy this film even though the ending might not be a happy one i enjoyed it
<START> i feel dumber after watching the first 20 min luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly not because of the budget of the film or the special effects just simply good acting and getting simple things right and most importantly not being lame but i guess this was produced for those sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is ''a good be scared of rating films low save your under appreciated high scores for in a life time keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinions don't spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds peace love
<START> i think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car to get stripped deserves whatever happens to them br br the guy wade who went to a barbershop and asked for the he man haircut wasn't my type but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed that's a little too high maintenance for me br br also fun but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks like elton john only gayer but that whole plot goes nowhere br br blake was hot i could see myself with him if he wasn't so into his girlfriend who is a phony paris hilton in a bad wig no in her handbag though but that would have been really precious i don't think girls who look like that go to football games anyways nick the car thief is the sexiest one of the best parts is where a football lands by him and instead of throwing it back he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football see that's just the kind of guy he is he has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wife beater her bra straps are showing for like 1 2 the movie br br mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this
<START> jim performances as the harem girl and a u are amazingly funny on a level surpassing chaplin and keaton linda is great in her once in a lifetime role as the hometown waffle waitress longing for adventure unfortunately the remaining 90 of the movie was unwatchably bad due to the atrocious plot the makers of ernest goes to africa did not rise to the creative challenges inherent in low budget film production only worth seeing on cable
<START> what ever happened to shows with united parental figures the parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the children instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative they let her get away with murder they can't ever agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with the children and instead they do nothing yeah great plan just ignore their behavior because they're cute this show tells the already manipulative preteens that watch it that the divide and conquer technique is the best way to get their parents to cave the oldest children are constantly running amok and getting themselves into all sorts of impossible situations but there are no consequences for their actions yeah great television all right
<START> by the acclaimed surrealist bunuel is an attack on the catholic church and its loss of values it is not a visual film and i think it would have played better on the stage bunuel takes us through this man the that lives like christ lived a true follower i e in poverty and without a care for property and what the next day some might call it a parallel to christ's story but any follower and practitioner of the word life should be like christ in a way but in essence bunuel also inquires into the ogle of man's selfishness and need to sin and how goodness may save us all it is a bold statement to make that may enliven or recite to memory the movie for some truth be told the is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it his selfishness is his folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin with the same face on each side lots of people represent sides of a coin in this movie all with both faces the same but the movie isn't exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its ethical and within the movie's own doctrine not top notch bunuel but a surreal dream sequence that bunuel stages where the message of the movie is framed and is worth noting for it shows you the capability of the director bunuel
<START> sadness was the emotion i felt after the screen went dark puzzled was another why would two seasoned screen vets like matthau and lemmon sign on to this putrid project i'm under the impression they didn't read the script before the cameras started rolling all the cast is wasted in this unfunny uninteresting and unimpressive movie sadly enough this was one of elegant edward last projects here as the heavy dyan cannon tries hal linden looks bored donald o'connor reciting a few lines laden with profanity i'm not with the legion of decency my point is they were spouted purely for the strangeness of hearing him use off color language that is a desperate attempt to infuse humor into a picture he actually did deliver the film's only morsel of entertainment when he about on the though i save my harshest criticism for the leads walter matthau should have known better he still delivers great solo performances iq dennis the menace etc his character although affable is rather dull and one dimensional seen him once seen him all jack lemmon gives another one of his trademark weepy just too darn sensitive male portrayals when he starts that mode i vicariously want to hand him a box of tissues out to sea is painfully unfunny and whoever produced this mess should be made to walk the plank
