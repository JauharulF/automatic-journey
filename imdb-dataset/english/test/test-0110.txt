<START> now don't get me wrong i love a good film and after watching the thin red line and loving it i was eager to track down terrence two earlier films and having just watched days of heaven my enthusiasm to see badlands has virtually disappeared br br i have noted much rave about the beautiful photography but i saw this film on a terribly old vhs tape which made it look pretty awful all i can say is i hope the photography was superb because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this film not since the replacement killers have i fallen asleep during a film this film felt so long and it wasn't the editing was choppy and disjointed the storyline non existent the voice over was an incoherent ramble the characters weakly developed and the whole thing was uninvolving i know that malick was uncertain of how to do the film he consequently shot a heck of a lot of footage then spent around two years editing in an attempt to piece it all together this is very apparent on screen everything looks chopped up every time a scene seemed to gain some momentum or some character development it would obtrusively cut to boring scenes of people doing boring things it was as if someone had tried to cut together a story out of stock footage of people farming the few good points are the music and the chase scene near the end but those things are no where near enough to maintain interest i would normally let a bad film pass by without being too vocal but when it is so highly over rated something must be said br br maybe a farmer would like it
<START> it's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film most early german films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early german romantics like e t a hoffman and others in fritz lang's der tod also from 1921 death personified takes a young man away from his sweetheart but in lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior neither of the young lovers deserves to die but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death br br in victor however repentance is always an option destiny can be altered and death deferred through the characters' choices although scenes of the phantom carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie these horrific images of death as the great leveler are compromised by death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale david holm a brutal drunk who because of a perverse hatred of humanity spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone he comes in contact with br br one new year's eve holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion as the first person to die on the stroke of midnight holm must become the driver of the phantom carriage and collect souls during the new year the phantom carriage driven by an old acquaintance who had started holm on his road to ruin comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery along the way holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him br br perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the selma novel on which the film is based but i would have preferred to see david holm unable to escape his destiny and to see his repentance come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and herself and to see holm suffer for the consequences of his sins by being made to collect their souls it would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others in the film however the nature of destiny isn't the message redemption is the driver of the carriage allows holm's spirit to return to his body and he rescues his family in the nick of time his repentance smacks of scrooge's repentance in a christmas carol br br if the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you there is still much to admire in the film's images the special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the day and still hold up which is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a hand cranked camera also the restored film on new dvd looks fabulous
<START> ah batman returns is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original with batman returns it came pretty close we have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains catwoman and the penguin we have michael keaton back as batman and he's still awesome than ever michelle pfieffer the perfect choice for catwoman and was perfectly cast into place as much as i love and is such an incredible actress annette benning she couldn't have been catwoman she doesn't really have the look danny devito who could have imagined him as the penguin he was just great and terrifying br br batman returns with a more loving community of gotham city they are celebrating christmas time with max shrek played by a creepy christopher walken the perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the penguin and the attempt to make him loved in gotham when she survives and is awakened by cats she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats but there is also another active villain the penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of gotham city can batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well br br you'll have to see batman returns is just as good as the original batman despite the first one remaining the true classic this one still takes you for a ride and come on i mean we've got michelle in leather her classic moment of just meeting batman and the penguin meow is classic there are memorable characters lines and sets you'll have a blast trust me br br 9 10
<START> another lame attempt to make a movie gritty and thought provoking whatever the hell that means they have al pacino say a lot of words like television killed football yeah whatever this is another movie that showcases oliver stone's delusions of grandeur if stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and kid rock songs he even throws cameron diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons it's a shame that diaz and pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad br br ever since scent of woman writers and directors have used pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines his characters are nothing more than loudspeakers their voices covering up what would normally be redundant and trite he needs to reinvent himself showing how he can act without yelling he has to stop feeling sorry for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like organized football is messed up and act out a good story
<START> ettore scola's masterful rendering of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience it is a worthy successor to the classics such as senso and il as well as rosselini's the 19th century is indeed a fruitful source for italian filmmakers the period settings and trappings are beautifully realized here but the story is timeless and could occur in any period what is so intriguing in this story is that the hero becomes trapped in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds himself the vigorously pursued object of desire and he is quite powerless to extricate himself from the alarming circumstances handsome and callow giorgio giraudeau is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but light minded married mistress and falls prey to the dangerous passion of enamored the ugly and sickly daughter of his stern commander girotti the resulting anguish and ensuing tragedy this unlikely pair undergoes make them both understandable pitiful and immensely sympathetic to viewers bernard stellar performance will captivate and leave a lasting impression not to be missed
<START> yet another recent comedy that shows that hollywood can't even do the basics when it comes to film making that it used to do in its sleep for decades if the writer director had any brains they would have based the film around stamp's character of tyrant boss jack taylor when he's in the film early on it's nothing special but it is mildly promising and occasionally amusing once he departs for the majority of the film and kutcher has his 'hilarious' adventures house sitting with guest after boring guest dropping in the film totally disintegrates br br as a result what should have been a passable turns into an inept stinker
<START> peter boyle was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gun ho bigot making me hate him everytime he used the n word i watched him and his big mouth and wanted to punch his lights out just think peter boyle was a monk once now a supporting actor in everybody loves raymond susan sarandon making her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in his own dirty water i noticed a large ann doll creator john was the only thing that susan could actually trust and love and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes if you really want to know about the way out 70's with drugs free love and pipe dreams then enjoy the excellent direction of john g rocky and the karate kid i always thought that peter boyle should have been blown away in the end this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others
<START> this is a film that left me breathless wanting to learn more of the afghan history and traditions with todays evil doer mantra reality it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs br br casting was impeccable the scenery simply marvelous the acting was first rate and the fact that the academy overlooked this except it's music is unforgivable br br the script is wonderful and such and emotional journey provoking an ugly cry from this watcher br br a film worth watching a second and third time
<START> there is no reason to watch this film br br why many reasons first up the acting is awful there is hardly a line that isn't but that is hardly surprising given the banality stupidity and repetitiveness of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth it is awfully written one of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character's line br br repeat br br yes they repeat it for the whole movie br br the whole movie br br yes the whole movie br br etc br br in movies like this you generally know who the bad guys are and what they are after all the good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys setting up a good with x in my grasp i will rule the universe villain is the first stop in any cheapo sf plot but in this turkey you tell me br br as i understand it our heros are a bunch of mass murderers sent into the past on a dirty dozen type mission they are sent by a fascistic totalitarian state to stop some other mass murderers from altering the course of history the new history would not include the rise of totalitarianism and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the earth a dead planet we know all this because this movie has one of those handy long on screen situation reports just before the action starts telling you who is who and what is what it's an indication of who the producers think their target audience will be that it is narrated as well as appearing on screen just to save the audience from taxing their brains too much by doing a lot of reading so just who are we supposed to be rooting for here i guess we are asked to believe our hero undertakes some sort of journey from totalitarianism to love peace and understanding while shooting loads of people but that doesn't work as an arc because we are shown he is a decent ish human being right at the start when he tries to rescue all the civilians aboard the rebel station br br i guess the makers were aiming at some sort of deeper than normal complexity in this film but they just ended up with an unholy mess with more plot holes and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or so of your average crap sf movies br br the opening credits were nice
<START> a dark yet humorous tale involving a cop who has a first hand experience with vampires and decides he must quit his job to pursue these evil beings most of the film contained questionable acting plot props and filming the fight scenes were as hokey as a middle schooler's rendition of a wwii battle the lines delivered were spoken as if the actors had no motivation for being there the props were bad because they did not even look like they could function in the slightest amount the majority of the film appeared to be shot in someones basement in some scenes you could see the rafters overhead in a scene that was not supposed to look like that of a basement the plot had no motivation to move forward or go backwards it just appeared to stand still at times with no reason for some characters actions i felt at times the sounds effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more of a cartoon series it is similar to the movie blade in that he is an african american vampire hunter however that is where all similarities end and the movie looks closer to a saturday night live spoof
<START> in the final days of the year 1999 most everyone in taiwan has died a strange plague has ravished the island supposedly spread by cockroaches the disease sends its victims into a psychosis where they act like the insects eventually they die the hole takes place in a crumbling apartment building which is especially well created kudos to the set designer its two protagonists live right above and below each other the woman is on the lower floor and the pipes above her apartment are leaking fiercely threatening to destroy her food supply not to mention her sanity she calls a plumber to go check it out and he accidentally pokes a hole through the floor of the man's apartment the two have never met before and they come into contact through the hole br br the script is quite brilliant few films are simultaneously this funny while remaining completely human deeply exploring the human condition especially feelings of loneliness and despair tsai's direction is simply beautiful like a lot of other taiwanese directors he uses a lot of long takes but unlike say hou hsiao hsien tsai doesn't overuse them in fact i don't know if i've ever seen them used better they're always effective and never tedious br br it would be wrong to review this film without mentioning the musical numbers yes the hole is also a musical and a great one at that in the film's best scenes which is saying something considering how good all the other scenes are the man imagines that the woman is a singer almost a cabaret singer these numbers are fully choreographed often with backup dancers and singers in a stroke of genius tsai has these elaborately produced numbers take place in the crumbling building the signs of apocalypse and decay this provides both a sense of pathos and absurdity br br the hole is a film that begs to be seen it ought to be a cult classic if nothing else before i went to see this i was told that it was a decent film but probably tsai ming liang's least good one well if that is true i just cannot wait to see another one 10 10
<START> 2006 shown in the u s as the golden door was written and directed by emanuele this film is different and i think better than most movies about impoverished people who leave europe and come to the united states br br the film begins with scenes in a poor rural region of sicily we always hear that sicily is a rocky island but you won't really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first half hour of the golden door br br the middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the u s most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the third class section becoming seasick and then show us the statue of liberty not this movie we get a sense for life below decks and it isn't charming we never actually see the statue of liberty either br br finally the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of ellis island and then the immigrants are walking through new york's lower east side not here the ellis island experience occupies about one third of the footage br br vincenzo amato is outstanding as salvatore mancuso who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world charlotte gainsbourg is equally good as lucy reed a mysterious englishwoman who also speaks fluent italian br br there are some strange touches in the movie especially the sound track with songs by nina simone there must be some symbolism there but i couldn't make sense of it br br another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on dvd still large screen or small screen it's worth seeking out
<START> though some would prefer to comment on the value of bond movies in the connection of learning frequency and while most of the jargon that tends to limit bond to a meager 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable contention there are several redeeming that extend the credibility of sean connery in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by jessica tandy in driving miss daisy while connery had been less visible in the latter his woman seeker qualities had maybe not cast a frown on the face of embittered spectators as it would in this latest rendition which to most involved approached the 007 theme with kind resentment albeit while the general flavor had been altered great for those who interest others while faking to be who you're not
<START> i am very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie br br i watched the film 9 years ago and i still remember how angry i felt to sit in the movie theatre and to look at this mess i am a big fan of john boorman's work i really like his movies so i went to beyond with big expectations but i felt like watching a dumb cheap chuck norris jungle movie with all action scenes cut out even the soundtrack was very annoying br br i can't believe that john boorman was the director because this movie was so badly done i think the burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle
<START> when i first saw the previews for this movie on tv i thought that this could be a funny movie i was wrong all though i am not totally against movies that make fun of others some are actually funny such as the first scary movie this was one of many that have been made as of late that are not the humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull br br i feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as varsity blues friday night lights stick it etc and if you are anything like me you try to pick out each movie instead of paying attention to whats going on in this one even the adult humor in this movie was dry do yourself a favor and save you money and time and rent don't rent this movie
