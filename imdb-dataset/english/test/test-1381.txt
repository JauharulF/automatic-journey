<START> i've seen just about all of the coen brothers' films now and i have to say this is one of their better films i wouldn't dare say it's better than the big lebowski but it was very good in it's own right br br i thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times i loved all the characters especially tim blake nelson delmar and john turturro's pete br br there really isn't anything bad i can say about this movie but this movie isn't for everyone it might be safe to say that if you liked the other coen brothers' films then you'll hopefully like this one too and if you liked what you saw in the trailer i think you'll like the film but don't hold me to it br br anyhow i hope that you like d the film as much as i do thanks for reading br br chris
<START> not for the squeamish but the number of twists inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology gorgeous visual extremes together with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most stunning horror films i've ever seen it descends into utter madness along with characters but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose there are copious amounts of bloodletting accompanied by some nasty sucking and squishing sounds but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud as he tends to do chan wook park keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters br br and there's a lot of literal leaping keeping in the vein of vampire myth pun intended they have superhuman strength and can nearly leap tall buildings in a single bound to coin a phrase the first time our heroine is carried by the across the tops of buildings by the troubled vampire priest it has all the magical romance of lois lane and superman but this romance becomes increasingly disturbing but driven by a strange and conflicted 'love affair' not by mere horror br br the acting is superb particularly ok vin kim the gorgeous actress in the female lead role who at 22 shows a range that is remarkable the character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type she careens from innocent to impish to vixen to demon with utter conviction this is a really smooth and nervy performance br br if you love real art in horror or are a fan of oldboy don't wait for the video see it immediately
<START> it's pretty good all things considered a must for anyone perplexed about the opposite sex i e all of us the trailer doesn't give away any of the plot for good reason br br the premise is absurd so it's nice to see that it doesn't take itself seriously it's like someone from the bbc children's department decided to make a film for adults that's not a bad thing imo br br 7 10
<START> hitchcock's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of but also the 'look' of anthony perkins he projected a kind of clean cut innocence a young teen idol type of persona he was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like especially in the 50's when this ultra chilling aspect of mental illness split personality psychosis was relatively unexplored in film which is exactly why the casting of him as norman bates was a slice of true hitchcockian genius audiences were taken by surprise to put it mildly br br that's why this re make does not work even a little bit in spite of trying to be an exact copy whereas anthony perkins looked like someone you would never think of as being a serial killer vince vaughn is easily imaginable as one he lacks the frail look of perkins and his acting chops are clearly inferior as well at least in this role honestly has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as genuinely as anthony perkins while it was a pointless re make to begin with the miscasting of the story's most important character sucks this film down completely br br as a side note i feel that hollywood's propensity for re making great movies because 'young' people refuse to watch anything that's not filmed in color not only stinks to high heaven of corporate greed but is exceptionally disrespectful to the original work as for viewers who can't watch black and white it's their loss hopefully they'll mature sometime in the future and no longer require shiny colours to hold their attention when they do they'll discover that sometimes black and white works far better with the background muted the story and performances are that much more front and center and in many cases the mood or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography is just not attainable in colour
<START> i think the consensus is pretty unanimous about this recent tv miniseries it's okay but it's a far cry from lonesome dove it gets compared to the latter simply because this a prequel to that famous story br br moon is definitely worth a watch for any fan of westerns just don't expect it to be as intense as lonesome dove steve and karl urban are not robert duvall and tommy lee jones and the characters they play aren't as strong as how duvall and jones portrayed the same two guys some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison but you have to compare it it's the story of the same two leading texas ranger characters woodrow call and gus br br the main difference i found was that this prequel is a lot of slower and more the two rangers and their women at times yet i didn't mind that because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally likable and agreeable people they were played nicely by linda clara forsythe and elizabeth banks maggie they helped make this long movie palatable if you've seen pictures of women in the old west none of them looked half as pretty as and banks though they were a joy for these male eyes to ogle maggie's son newt was a wonderful kid too the kind of boy every parent would want br br the most interesting character i thought turned out to be inish scull played by val kilmer as in the western film tombstone kilmer almost steals the show from the leads scull is really an original if i ever saw one a strange dude indeed br br actually all of the supporting actors in here did a fine job from keith robinson's to wes studi as buffalo hump i always find studi to be fascinating no matter what role he plays i wish he had had a bigger role in this miniseries br br one thing this film has in common with lonesome dove and other good westerns the scenery and photography it's just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch we also have an excellent director of this film simon who directed lonesome dove and an another outstanding tv western crossfire trail he also did two of my other favorite feature films both based in his home country of australia lap and quigley down under br br unfortunately although i enjoyed this moon is nothing as good as the above mentioned films yet i still watched all of it and was sorry it ended if that makes any sense it made me want to watch woodrow and gus again this time with tommy lee and robert br br note the title page says this is 360 minutes that must have included the tv commercials the two disc dvd version i saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes
<START> this film had everything i need in a film women skateboarding violence music by h i m and tony hawk the artwork and camera effects in this film is amazing the music in this film is the best i've heard in any other film each track goes so well with its scene i thought the acting was really good considering none of bams crew have been in scripted films before although the whole concept of the film is the story of ryan dunn and his girlfriend who is sleeping with hellboy behind his back is a predictable and age old story they way its acted out is very unpredictable for example falcone and the gas tank himself dunn breaking bottles behind the and all the don vito scenes this films is a must see
<START> minor spoilers br br a woman gets pregnant but not by her husband she develops 'something' inside her or at least thats what her husband thinks they go through a lot of hard times while she is on the brink of a nervous breakdown the husband contacts an ufo professor and with his help they try to find out what is wrong with her br br minor spoilers br br the story could have been a bit better or at least be made less predictable but the movie is catchy and it got me and my sister hooked through the entire movie without a problem the acting is very good and the filming is much better than normal if you compare this to your normal b alien movie the effects are good and something is happening every second of the movie the characters are really likable and apart from a stupid nurse in scene they are all very convincing in their roles br br i thought it was a good movie and can recommend it if you like alien monster abduction movies br br 7 10 the story could have been a bit less predictable
<START> a real insult to the original spoorloos which is one of the most genuinely disturbing films and i intend this as a compliment i have seen in the last years br br where the original is chilling and brilliant the remake is flat and even boring especially the happy end finale takes away what little suspense there was in this film in the first place br br while such a distortion especially grafting a happy end which wasn't there previously is quite frequently the case in hollywood remakes of european art house movies and could've been expected the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this inane mess was created by the very same filmmaker who did the original spoorloos br br why mr sluizer decided to ruin his masterpiece in such a fashion is beyond me br br avoid this abomination at all cost as it might spoil the original for you even if watched after that let alone the other way round
<START> this is the greatest example i can think of to prove the theory that when hollywood runs out of good ideas they make an awful sequel and ruin the first one now don't get me wrong i absolutely love the first beastmaster i even liked the third one pretty good but this movie is atrocious i am a huge fantasy sword sorcery movie fan and i hated to see such a terrible sequel made to such a classic as the first beastmaster so why do i hate this movie so much well where do i begin first of all the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous dar and his evil older brother who was nowhere mentioned in the first movie huh cross over into our world via a handy dimensional time portal gate ya see earth just happens to be on the same parallel plane as world whereas with the first movie you're led to think the movie just takes place in the past but with this one you're shown it's a completely whole other world altogether that's just one of the many things i hated about this sequel it didn't work with masters of the universe and it sure doesn't work here either movies like this should take place and stay in their own time line and their usual surroundings for christ's sake what's next hercules in new york er uh bad example moving on br br after a device called a neutron detonator to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom so it's up to dar his ferrets his eagle and his tiger not a spray painted one this time to go off and save the world but along the way they have the help of a young cool and hip senator's daughter who gets caught up in this whole mess and she show's dar around l a takes him for a joyride in her bmw and helps get him out of tight situations here and there how convenient right and speaking of convenient i found it awfully convenient and easy for to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen highly destructive nuclear weapon even with half the u s army and l a p d after him waaaaay to easy even for an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world there are sooo many plot holes in this i don't know where to begin like why did go to the l a zoo for at the end of the movie he absolutely has no reason whatsoever to go there and wouldn't that be like the last place you'd lure your greatest enemy who just so happens to have the handy ability to control animals br br and don't you just love these kinds of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at one guy they still don't manage to hit him the police in this movie belong in the police academy series they are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind even the title of the movie makes no sense beastmaster 2 through the portal of time they never actually went through a time portal because the movie isn't set in the future of world it's set in a parallel world along ours in the astral plane so they never actually go through time only a dimensional world along theirs so no actual time travel is involved at all this movie tries to come off as funny and it does not because of the humor but because it's just so bad and that's putting it mildly the acting dialogue plot characters and ending are all so cheesy it's hilarious what more can i expect from the guy that brought us return of the another bad sequel sorely missed here is don wonderful directing and serious feel of the first one avoid this stinking piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and stick which the first one and maybe the third one if there's nothing better on t v
<START> it's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of three colors red without letting people in on some of the ideas that has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy the more i see them and think of them and imagine myself in their world the more i get its theme that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion in blue juliette binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected in white an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will against the odds conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle and now in red all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other people's lives br br this young girl is appropriately named valentine a luminous irene jacob who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway not that she is without some baggage she has a boyfriend unseen who also demands to know what she is doing at all times she has a brother who troubles her and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard she strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health but when she takes her to the owner a retired judge jean louis he does not want her i want nothing he coldly says and elements of blue suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man who also lives in anonymity and apparent free floating freedom conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people this male version of juliette binoche's character at first shocks valentine she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror but a chance event has her back at his place and here is when he begins revealing who he is and his great loss br br at the same time is unfolding a parallel story the story of a young man auguste jean pierre about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from valentine but they keep missing each other chance is the word like valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits elements of chance pepper her life and he has a girlfriend who also supplies people with reports about the weather one of them happens to be the old judge he knows more about her than auguste does and he's never met her like god or prospero he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression we meet again it's this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes red so beautiful and transcendent because time is in reality a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it there are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames so many things would be different br br such is the case with valentine and the old judge i believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond she is that woman whom he did not meet by chance or not and is whether he knows it or not trying to make amends hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the social outcast but it doesn't end there one of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container where julie did not see her and would not have helped her anyhow and fresh from his public humiliation sneers at her thinking someone is worse off than i am valentine is the one who helps her frailty in need can happen anywhere and even applies it here in a minor character br br now red is so much more than a story valentine the old judge auguste even rita the dog these aren't characters confined by storytelling an american version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbed down ending red is so devoid of a linear defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and place br br adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal this is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films in blue julie's husband had a mistress and she also betrays olivier when it's become clear she's emotionally dead in white dominique has listen to her moan over the phone which becomes an important device in red as she has sex with a man while the billboard of contempt looks on in red the old judge's tale of love and betrayal gets re enacted and all this time valentine's billboard image looms over them like a of what is to come at the same time that rita the dog valentine's car struck bears seven pups life renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously filmed with care and love why do i say six you'll have to watch the movie and wonder
<START> i have a strong feeling that what you think of this film will strongly depend on your frame of reference if you've never seen a miyazaki film before then it will probably confuse the heck out of you if you have seen a miyazaki film before then it will still probably confuse the heck out of you but you won't really care that's because i found that the first time i saw one of his animated films i tried too hard to figure out what was happening and why and it impacted my enjoyment of the film now that i have seen just about every miyazaki film i see the bizarreness and just take it all in enjoying the beauty of it all in many ways these films at least to western audiences is like drugs lots of strange and beautiful images that don't always initially make sense but sure feel great to see of all the miyazaki films this might have the most unusual and incomprehensible story line even more so than spirited away and princess mononoke or my neighbor totoro but like these and many other studio films if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a fabulous tale but because it is so hard to describe and others have already done so i won't even go there br br as for the artwork it's very typical of one of these japanese films though there was one noticeable change there was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds this was not a bad thing at all the lovely pastel like look was very pleasing and unique in some ways it looked like a tiny bit of bill art style was infused into a typical miyazaki film with a high frame rate exceptional character animation which imbued them with tons of personality and a great wow factor this is an exceptional film for all ages though clearly designed more for younger audiences the totoro fans especially it is a bit scary here and there during the storm segments but there is plenty of great stuff for adults as an adult at least chronologically so i loved the cute stuff and applaud the other worldliness of the film br br a great film among miyazaki's best i don't give it a 10 because i am hesitant to ever do that plus i did like a few of the studio's other films a bit more particularly totoro but that doesn't mean you shouldn't rush out now and see it do it and do yourself a favor
<START> this has to be one of the if not the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this piece of sh t i felt as though i should write to madonna and demand compensation for my time but now i feel that i should write madonna and demand a great 80s album considering she can't record a good album to save her life anymore in return for this disaster br br on to the movie itself which can be summed up like this br br it consists madonna jumping around acting like a spoiled teenager who lost her way she is trying to impress this absolute douche of an actor who plays the in the movie but the best was the ending i was staring with my jaw on the ground into the television as the credits rolled by thinking to my self that's it that's the ending what a piece of sh t if madonna wasn't a pop icon at the time of this film this movie would have single handedly destroyed her career and the funniest thing of the whole situation was that i just watched the damn movie to see where they placed the song who's that girl well guess where they placed it at the end
<START> i got this on a double feature dvd called scream theater and it's no doubt one of the most terrible movies i've ever seen and i've seen some really bad ones school's out and of three girls who if they're teenagers i'd eat my hat are talking about non stop party so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict for a slumber party meanwhile a psychotic has escaped the local bug house where one girl's father works is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs and sporting wide open eyes i guess that's to show he's bonkers of course since he has a bone to pick with that particular doctor off he goes to his house the location of which is apparently common knowledge in the meantime some dumb jock types are slamming down beers and out to scare the girls and of course the loony shows up too and starts cutting throats and that's about it as the heavy metal music chugs along in the background or maybe that's not it but really that's all you need to know unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk you'll find little of interest here and even if you are wasted most of the time you'll still probably find your intelligence insulted 1 out of 10
<START> it is more a subtle story of the fact that in indian household how most decisions are taken by the man how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires not to give the woman pleasure and in such a type of scenario women invariably have two choices either to accept all this and take it into their own life which is usually the case or not accept this and try to mould things to satisfy themselves which makes a movie br br fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option which women choose for themselves no sacrifice not to serve anybody else rather a decision for their own good somehow the whole idea of justifying lesbianism didn't find an acceptance in the indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self expression then the whole debate doesn't even arise
<START> the following review is one from the wrong side of the tracks meaning two things you will hear nothing but praises coming from me and don't be fooled by my rating i also could tell you that this review contains no spoilers but technically that's a lie br br well screw the review i'm just going to ramble a bit it has been a while since i had so much fun with such a bad film and if you cannot enjoy this piece of utter drivel then you simply have no sense of humor first off this movie was meant to be taken seriously and that's the main aspect were the fun is coming from the story a doctor's son is terminally ill daddy doctor decides that a hart transplant must be the only way of saving his son so in true mad doctor style he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick of course the gorilla heart is much too potent for a human so sonny boy transforms into this hideous ape man that immediately breaks free and goes on a killing and raping spree because that's simply what any horny beast would do isn't it the make up of our ape man is hilarious there's simply no other way of putting it the guys' face looks like a turd i'm talking human excrement here the solid brown kind beautiful the gore in this flick is wonderful too aside from real footage of an open heart surgery we also have incredibly fake but quite nasty looking blood gore effects a decapitation an eye gouging a throat ripping the of someone's skull it's hilarious and indeed it's quite incomprehensible why night of the bloody apes ever made it to the notorious uk video nasties list because all of the nasty things portrayed in this film are simply too ridiculous to be taken seriously oh and there's only one bloody ape running around in it too by the way so needless to say that la is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and convincing tale of science gone horribly wrong br br when not trying to shock with poorly staged acts of bloody violence or random portrayals of female nudity this movie manages to be highly entertaining with ingredients like nonsensical dialogues cheap cardboard sets plot stupidity and incredibly bad acting just a few random examples maybe about the sets one can clearly see that the set designers just used the same walls doors windows etc over and over again to be build various different interior sets e g one side of the hospital room the window side where the unconscious wrestling girl lies looks suspiciously similar like the window side of the basement laboratory from where ape man escapes the set designers also took one of the side windows from the laboratory made it a bit larger and just placed it in the conference room of the hospital all the walls in any building are the same grey ones then there's the setting of the park clearly shot in a studio you can see on several occasions that the grass is loose whenever there's some struggling fighting raping going on the grass just shifts and shuffles and you can see the grey concrete from the studio floor beneath it br br just a few random lines that come out the actors' mouths br br in the conference room where all the doctors are debating the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl a disappearance that would of course mean bad publicity for the hospital daddy doctor intelligently utters we find ourselves in a situation that is difficult br br during that same debate a colleague doctor cleverly remarks a sleepwalker any sleepwalker gets up hereby providing a solid excuse for the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl br br after our investigating detective through the amazing process of his own logical deduction concludes and tells his superior that the murderer must be a half man half beast his superior answers that it's absurd adding the line it's more probable that of late more and more you're watching on your television many of those pictures of terror truly one of the best lines of the movie br br other sources of laughter br br the two scenes were daddy doctor and his igor like assistant kidnap the gorilla from the zoo and unconscious wrestling girl from the hospital these well thought out acts of abduction are like taking candy from a baby br br daddy doctor speaks to god a lot doesn't he br br sonny boy calling daddy doctor papa on more than one occasion br br an old lady screaming aaargh a dead man a dead man a dead man a dead man br br the plot periodically stops to wallow in scenes of women wrestling only to go on again and do nothing with that concept sure daddy doctor replaces sonny boy's gorilla heart a second time with that of unconscious wrestling girl but do you think something spectacular happens after that like ape turd man growing breasts or something trying to rape men this time our leading living wrestling beauty norma doesn't even go into a climactic wrestling contest with ape turd man near the movie's finale but ape turd man does start to show some motherly love near the end almost and i say almost in true king kong style i e the top of a building and people on the ground pointing and screaming br br okay i think that's enough now i chipped in more than my two cents here rational rating for this sleazy piece of hilarious dreck 2 10 rating from the wrong side of the tracks 8 10 go see this film people it is well worth it
