<START> when i finally got around to seeing this film recently it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance yet another hollywood cg live action rehash of an established cartoon franchise nothing special or memorable whatsoever designed in every way possible to appeal to very young children and very immature adults making heavy use of comedic devices such as farts poo eating and the size of theodore's butt br br this film would bother me a lot less if it weren't such an obvious step down for the chipmunks even their characters i found were changed for the worse for this movie while in the past each one of them had a very distinct personality here they all behaved like immature smart alecky children with add constantly bouncing erratically off the walls it especially bothered me to see simon portrayed in this way he's supposed to be the smart serious nerd who acts as the straight man to alvin's crazy antics but here he's pretty much a carbon copy of alvin one joke in the film even implies that simon only thinks he's smart but really isn't and honestly if i had never heard of the chipmunks before seeing this film i would have agreed br br in my opinion this film is just another obvious cash grab and i'm more than a little sorry it was even made the fact that it's a kid's movie doesn't excuse its flaws to excuse a stupid movie that degrades a classic franchise just because it's for children is insulting to children and any kid would deserve something more intelligent than this film
<START> i don't understand the exaggerated good critics about this film except that a lot of people from venezuela are understandably very excited based on that the venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the region br br the movie first of all is too repetitive a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles so you get the impression that it's a time filler a time filler is also a good point as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clock br br all actors are quite bad by exception of the venezuelan guy edgar ramirez who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the venezuelan recruit pedro br br by the way this is not a representative movie about the people of the region caribean zone it tends to ridicules them
<START> my friend took me to a screening of this movie in hollywood and it was awesome it's a film noir with amazing acting great script cool music the whole thing was very well done and entertaining don't know if it is getting a release in theaters but this would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at blockbuster this is the kind of movie i love low on budget but big on style and imagination i hope alexandra holden gets more big parts like she has in this one she is fantastic
<START> 'take and 'you've got and roughly jam them together and what do you got this god awful movie custom made for dull normal adolescents the plot very closely follows 'you've got served ' three ghetto afro this time living in john water's far from their time getting failing grades in high school and dancing in dilapidated 100 year old buildings with mamas to finance their expensive baggy hip hop clothing tastes they steal cars and deliver them to the local chop unlike john tony travolta who worked in a brooklyn paint store so he could purchase his polyester disco clothes br br tyler gage one of the black three musketeers gets caught trashing the local fame high school and is forced to perform janitorial duties he meets nora clark a 26 year old white high school student and discovers he's irish american much to the chagrin of his black buddies mac and skinny br br as in 'you've got crime doesn't pay and skinny the youngest member of the trio gets shot by a bad bad leroy brown that doesn't stop the heart stopping finale
<START> this asterix is very similar to modern disney cartoons soulless technically good and the usual in jokes for adults maybe it's because this is the first cartoon i watched after laputa castle in the sky but it was quite disappointing br br the plot is contrived and forgettable but it involves asterix and going to the territory to rescue a spoilt teenager who then learns humility and finds love as well oh and initially they don't get on but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship yadda yadda br br the best bit is to watch out for the little jokes the vikings get all the best ones such as the chief's wife giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid or the vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy literally oh and olaf the dumbest viking is actually hilarious as much for the voice acting as the dialogue br br for example aboard the viking ship after a speech by abba the captain's daughter olaf who is this new guy captain that's my daughter cod brain olaf your daughter's a man
<START> this is one of my most favorite movies of all time pretty pathetic you say well yeah it is but chris is incredibly incredibly funny his innocent brilliance comes out in this film more than in any of his other films look at both motel scenes when spade gets caught with his zipper down and the other just go away for the love of god
<START> so totally unique and entertaining another great canadian invention a regular joe dan and a bunch of misfit delinquents aka puppets all share residence at a half way house its dan's job to keep an eye on four to society' and help them to rehabilitate bill the homicidal dummy the cigarette smoking dog buttons the nympho teddy bear and cuddles the comfort doll the five of them find themselves in all sorts of odd predicaments despite their homicidal and often overtly perverse sexual tendencies it's hard not to find them lovable br br i give this show a 10 10 simply because it provides good entertainment without needing a huge budget and exudes a canadian flair that makes me proud
<START> i found this to be an entertaining account of the challenges an independent film maker might encounter something i never even thought about the film managed to keep my interest the entire time and i actually laughed out loud more than once i'm not a film maker so i know nothing about the technology but i though it was well edited and flowed smoothly telling the story as a disclaimer i contributed to this effort after the fact providing music for the soundtrack but i was not involved in the creation of this film and i could not tell you a thing about repo man except that i remembered seeing it way back when i'm not really a sci fi fiend i enjoyed the comparisons the film made of punk rock file making to punk rock music my wife went with me to see the film and she did not know a thing about it before hand and we had a great time
<START> on the scale of 1 to 10 i gave this a 4 i thought the film was not very good with too much violence and not one character to like br br on an erotic scale i give this a 6 many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness i always enjoy nudity and nancy travis and faye grant come through but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic
<START> bad bad movie when i saw the synopsis i was expecting something like ring only with video game instead of tape nothing of the sorts happened i'll admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not it br br first of all choosing real life person countess is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story anybody even vaguely familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this hungarian end up in this movie choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much much better br br then there is whole you die in real life as you die in the game concept as i said before interesting ring like story but instead of developing it into good story line it sort of just flows along with no explanation given why did this game became such as it is why it was created and so on waste of good idea br br and finally this movie doesn't even have gory of funny parts that can if not save at least make crappy horror movies watchable death scenes are too quick and acting is too wooden to be funny br br avoid if possible
<START> being featured at the 2006 cannes film festival and gaining quite some fame this movie appears to be another modern and profound school drama br br it's about a bunch of adolescents who get through a revealing and desperate day at school everything's circling around a suicide shown at the very beginning to some extent that happens at 2 the characters are somehow all connected with each other what moves them is described via short interview sequences strictly shot in b w the characters are well written the acting is intriguing especially teresa palmer as melody and frank sweet as marcus are discoveries br br let's stick to the movies' technique that's what really impressed me there rarely are cuts most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists like in gus van elephant some scenes are presented more often than once but each time from a different point of view here character this surely evokes a slowly developing but grabbing atmosphere that drags you inside literally the colours are vibrant somehow unfitting considering the tough plot but that's nothing less than a clever contrast a disturbing fine thing' the use of lighting is adequate all the time underlining the characters' actual mood and finally there are decent placements of music br br 2 37 somehow itches you from the very beginning it does not compromise nor does it serve laughter it rather strings together what psychologists would define as terror moments this movie substantially focuses on emotional there ain't nobody who's not to handle some kind of neurosis even the depicted minor parts e g the teachers seem to be in some state of disorder and that is what keeps this movie from being really good its summing up of piercing tragedies is unrealistic to its very bones there is no friendship love smiling truth passion there is faking humiliation despair sickness and beating up it's like being hit in the face real hard all the time but you are numb after the first hour this flick keeps on hitting you until it reveals something quite instructive in the end br br for being sensitively and superbly acted 9 for being technically innovative and original 9 for being unidimensional 3 br br makes a solid 7 out of 10
<START> takes place in a small japanese rural town where people are going mad they go nuts over and spirals the crisis is getting worse because people are turning into snails and appear everywhere has to be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies i have seen the plot is really clever and the gore scenes are really funny as the film doesn't takes itself too seriously is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is top notch the characters are likeable and there is enough shocking surprises to satisfy fans of japanese horror despite of some hilarious scenes the overall tone of this film is pretty dark is not as good as ringu ju on or audition but if you like japanese horror movies you won't be disappointed 7 out of 10
<START> i recently purchased lost horizon on ebay having vivid memories of the things i will not miss number from childhood i am an ancient 29 i also recently finished the novel upon which it is based i was so pleasantly surprised to find a genuine hidden treasure a wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly told story subtly updated from the original film and by now quite a separate entity to the far more intellectual and thought provoking book by james hilton sally kellerman in particular has a radiant presence as the suicidal neurotic sally hughes who gradually warms to the charms of shangri la only liv flounders in her wooden portrayal of the schoolteacher a role far more suited to a julie andrews type the fact that finch and hussey are all dubbed isn't important as it is almost impossible to tell the songs do vary in quality the music being far superior to the lyrics but it is still a vibrant and engrossing film that really deserves a proper dvd release and a lot more recognition
<START> this so called movie is horrible the actors cannot act there is no plot i believe they need to start from scratch and film again i hope that they can correct the acting flaws in this movie i would like to see the trailer after they shoot it again maybe there is hope for it i am not out to hurt feelings but i believe high school kids can do a better job the wardrobe could have been much better sorry but this just did not do it for me i normally enjoy the trailers from this site but this one i cannot find entertaining i hope they take criticism well because i believe they will get much much more from others in regards to this film
<START> the photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor's revolt and the massacre at the town as much as the movie is a high point in the cinema it is also an example of realism by 1925 the soviet government actively used the arts including film as a means to spread the message of the revolution portrayal of the revolt on the battleship offers the viewer insight into the message of the soviet elite marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda
