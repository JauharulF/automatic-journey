<START> a recent re issue of the french crime film original title rififi chez les with its famous 20 minute silent jewel heist sequence now comes in the us in a gorgeous new print from the criterion collection with improved subtitles and some extras jules dassin was an american born julius dassin in connecticut who was forced to make films in europe because he was blacklisted rififi was well publicized in the us and did well in art houses later dassin became a lot more famous in the us for 'never on sunday' 1960 starring his wife the greek actress and political activist melina greece was again glamorized and popularized for americans and others with anthony quinn in 1964 the which was even a big hit in cairo the new rififi dvd includes a recent interview with dassin i did not previously realize that one of the main robbers cesar the milanese was played by dassin who stepped in when the original actor became unavailable he's one of the most memorable characters a dandified italian safe cracker who speaks no french br br although this classic has all the trappings of french film noir the black and white twilight world of well lit apartments shiny black cars men in suits the nightclub scenes including a dramatically filmed and lit title song performed at the club the stony faces and the in hand or mouth i don't think it's as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as melville's films do but there's the mesmerizing robbery which still holds up today as a tour de force it goes like clockwork with a fine sense of craft and teamwork among the robbers some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with things quickly go wrong after they go home and distribute the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a million dollar in it has there ever been a heist film whose perps lived happily ever after br br it's the wordless heist sequence that guarantees this a special place and dassin an american director who had an unusually varied and exotic career deserves full credit for that he took a novel so conventional he was going to reject it and added some key elements that make it special in the event he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation he needed the money too much jean who plays the lead character tony le was an actor rather down on his luck his grim face is perfect for the role he was later to play the lead in dassin's he who must die 1957 which used french actors in greece for a political tale is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film it pales compared to that also got us distribution it does have a good setting but it's wasted gone all bland and bright and of dassin's post hollywood oeuvre 'never on sunday ' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine is the popular choice and won best film at cannes 1960 'he who must die' the political choice the genre choice an odd piece is his with and tony perkins 1962 purists of tough guy hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor dassin's early films which include a prison drama force' 1947 a cop flick 'the naked city' 1948 and two hard core noirs highway' 1949 and 'night and the city' 1950 personally i tend to like french noir and american neo noir spinoffs better than the original american noir source material hence my enduring fascination with but dassin is rather unique in having not only made hollywood noir but then going over to paris and producing a memorable example of its fifties french derivative
<START> honestly at first i watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes i heard it possesses but by actually watching the film it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there truly it is one of the most well crafted and touching movies i've ever watched i'm a teenage bisexual and the film spoke to me about my predicaments sex religion love acceptance etc it gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who i am cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling dozes of heart warming lines and a bit of sexuality in it it made the movie more interesting some people compare it to brokeback mountain but i don't agree myself brokeback mountain has more drama while latter days is well balanced
<START> from director barbet schroder reversal of fortune i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class and i recognised the leading actress so i tried it despite the rating by the critics basically cool kid richard haywood half nelson's ryan gosling and justin pendleton bully's michael pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie 'the hyena' mayweather sandra bullock with new partner sam kennedy ben chaplin who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene e g non relating hairs the plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects it is just a question of if they can sway them away also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills chris penn as ray feathers r d call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst d a al swanson i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock's rope with the murdering for a challenge thing but this film does it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable adequate
<START> as one who loves films that appeal to intellectual as well as those that simply tell stories this film should have been appealing but as written and directed by catherine who seems to be playing out her own conundrums in film making experiences this tedious and talky film fails to arouse interest br br the main character jeanne anne is the screen form of a director frustrated in her attempts to film a convincing sex scene with two difficult actors grÃ©goire colin is the actor and mesquida is the actress the one bit is imposing the use of a dildo strapped onto the actor in order for her to drive the sex scene to fruition but even this sight gag wears thin quickly and we are left with a film within a film that feels more like a scenes' featurette on a dvd than a solid french comedy with class grady harp august 05
<START> this has got to be one of the best episodes of doctor who that i've seen since it came back last year there is a brilliant mix of amusement fear and tenderness all mixed up which equals one amazing episode the ood were brilliantly designed and i'm pretty sure there' going to be a lot of ood jokes in the next few weeks i myself am guilty of that already i particularly liked the way that we saw a different perspective of rose's and the doctor's relationship and the ending well it's the first time i have ever hidden behind a cushion i cannot wait until next weeks episode to find how they get out of this mess
<START> here you see mr eastwood in all of his glory i e at the top of his form as an actor and at the height of his physical appeal but the ladies depicted are hardly typical of the south then or now the young girls at the boarding school are incredibly naive some showing signs of developing into really depraved women and geraldine page full blown in her corruption hardly represents the mean when it comes to head mistresses of girls schools either then or now that is not to say that there isn't the occasional bad apple in any barrel mr eastwood has said this is one of his own two favorite films br br the beguiled does have an original plot a lot of attractive characters and many surprises in store for the viewer it's thoroughly engrossing and entertaining but not really realistic i know having grown up in the south and attended a girls' school and college moreover i have been acquainted with innumerable girls who did the same not to mention their laid back teachers or you might even say repressed professors who were a far cry from the headmistress depicted here she is downright comical in her depiction of a southern gentle woman who is not quite what she seems br br this movie was a little outrageous when it first appeared and still is i think but you won't be sorry you spent your time watching it
<START> ok imagine that every state in the us nay every country has exactly the same trees growing and ground foliage imagine also that a monkey camp so far off the beaten track you had to do the first half of the approach by river has a beautifully perfectly straight road leading up to it imagine a world where you have to wear a full biohazard suit to collect a floppy disk then you just drop it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket with no precautions as soon as you get back to the office a world where two nine year old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining this is the world this movie is set in br br on top of that it's one of the most clichÃ© ridden pieces of excrement it's been my misfortune to witness in many a year br br i liked it
<START> i really wanted to like this movie great cast Â walter pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic forbidden planet barbara eden and robert sterling as young lovers frankie avalon as a musically inclined sailor is a guy on a submarine a sailor even peter lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks maybe it's a good kiddie movie but i had trouble staying awake lorre was severely underused i guess he was a red herring like pidgeon Â you expect him to maybe go nuts and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark tank no such luck by the way why is there a shark tank on a submarine it's typical of the movie's lack of ambition they explain why lorre is walking the shark back and forth because we're seeing it but just expect us to accept the fact that there's a shark on this sub for some reason research yeah scientists are always doing that research stuff who can understand them of course if there wasn't a shark who would kill the evil psychologist lady joan fontaine i'm sorry but even kid's movies in the 50s are capable of being less predictable and frankly idiotic not to mention exploitative br br the first 10 or 15 minutes really got my hopes up great theme song sung by frankie avalon pidgeon leading floyd the barber howard mcnear actually sorry howie loved ya in blue hawaii and joan fontaine on a guided tour careful to skip the room with the huge warning sign on the door past peter lorre with aforementioned sharks and then we see a full screen shot of eden shaking her moneymaker to impassioned horn playing the movie quickly goes downstream from there there's no real explanation for the firestorm threatening the earth so there's a distinct lack of dramatic tension and no villain to boot instead character is made into an unconvincing red herring vaguely of the ahab variety i guess the caine mutiny was still fresh in people's minds and fontaine's character suddenly turns evil for no reason at the end oh i suppose the reason is that it's a surprise for the audience and it is kind of surprising since the only negative thing she's done is to talk bad about the captain's mental health and there's still no reason why she did the sabotage after she's revealed to be the villain very poorly done and unconvincing the guy who was the pessimistic bible nut was better Â at least his character made sense br br so what else could go wrong endless interminable scuba diving footage i never understand the appeal of that kind of thing a giant squid attacks the ship for a minute just so there's a monster for the theatrical trailer maybe that fooled some people into thinking it was going to be a fantasy adventure film instead of a half baked suspense movie about military scientists who are never wrong yes Â perhaps worst of all it's barely a fantasy movie much less a science fiction movie it never did anything for my imagination because the whole premise was nothing but another disaster apocalypse and these characters never experience any feelings of wonder or discovery i'm through with irwin allen i never liked his later movies anyway but this one got me by pretending to be jules verne when it's really just another formula exercise in disaster escapism the whole movie is just waiting to see which character will improbably turn evil and die he always hired an actor actress with a charming and personable screen persona to play these roles and that's the only element of surprise to be found since there's no logic to these characters anyway what a pathetic waste of time for these actors george pal's movies are 100 times better the only one that was lame was atlantis which not coincidentally was the most allen esquire full of wonder and excitement and Â think of it Â ideas other than a few effects scenes and barbara eden there's nothing worth seeing here in my opinion i guess it's good fun for those who are into disaster movies but i think they are a hollow and dull genre of films
<START> one chinese gang attacks and wipes out another gang in the beginning of the film unfortunately the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process oddly and without any discernible reason the gang solicits a volunteer to blame the massacre on and he leaves until the police decide to stop investigating now how one man alone is the one responsible for about 50 deaths is beyond me so sending this one guy away just seemed silly but that's the plot later when this man comes home betrayals and scheming have occurred leading to almost one hour and fifteen minutes of non stop killing br br if you are looking for a chinese martial arts film with much of a plot then you should probably skip this movie as its practically non stop action and practically no plot or character development even when compared to other martial arts films i would estimate that 80 90 of the film are fight scenes endless and reasonably well made fight scenes using knives again and again and again fight scenes if you want a film with a body count perhaps running into the hundreds as people are slashed kicked and slashed then this is the film for you the problem was by the end of the film there are literally no people left to kill and the film really lost my interest deep it ain't but if you want to see excitement and action only then this film is for you br br by the way this movie is set in contemporary times and no one thinks of shooting the hero until just near the end and when they finally do the logical thing it's too late and the effort is really really lame logical errors like this and the lady's suicide why make this a turn off your brain type of film
<START> incredibly vampire assassin is significantly worse than such atrocities as tequila body shots and zombie nation and those movies are terrible writer director star ron hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts possibly the worst camera work editing lighting sound visual effects music and fight choreography i have ever seen in a movie rarely do two shots cut together nor can you see much in the beyond dim lighting the terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast stretching the movie to a near deadly 87 minutes this is a truly laughable embarrassment for everyone involved obviously aficionados of terrible film making will want to see this but it's very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a bad movie viewer you are the fact that ron hall thought this was actually is astounding if you are a movie director and you actually think it's ok for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words slug before the title appears left over from your rough edit and you apparently can't muster the energy to edit those frames out then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting i am astounded that lions gate maple agreed to release this movie on dvd in spite of rudy ray moore's very brief cameo this movie is a work of supreme self indulgence on ron hall's part he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor and must also believe he possesses superior writing and directing skills but the movie is so unbelievably inept that it's hard to believe he'd actually want people to see it for fear of being brutally excoriated like i'm doing right now a jaw dropping insanely terrible movie i'm not kidding
<START> so it's a little dated now it's almost 30 yrs old amazingly enough i have this on beta tape and it still plays just fine if it came to dvd i'd snap it up in a heartbeat br br the drug humor is not appreciated nowadays as it was back then then it wasn't as much like driving without seat belts and child seats i can remember my father crying he was laughing so hard watching this i had coworkers in the 90's who'd seen it and i could bust them up by getting on the and saying br br great lines great spoof of the original and funny to me anyway even three decades later
<START> the main cast br br frantisek stella stanislav br br director vladimir gives this charming story of elderly folks enchanting twists that make the characters appealing really universal br br frantisek hana is retired and on a pension his previous occupation unknown he lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of forty four years emilie his son covets the spacious apartment as a problem solver as he needs to house one of his ex wives and several of their children the son isn't a vicious schemer just a guy with one past spouse too many and a blind eye to the attachment his dad has for the flat which he moved into after relinquishing a previous residence to the son br br hana and his also elderly close friend ed spend there more than ample free time doing small con jobs not for money but for the pleasure of putting one over on easily duped folks like estate agents a favorite ploy is for hana to act the part of a retired of new york's metropolitan opera returning home in need of a sprawling mansion ed is his companion as gullible fall all over themselves proffering chauffeured limousines and fine french restaurant meals in hope of a lucrative sale br br when not engaged in well planned scams the duo engage in quick ploys such as pretending to be railroad security agents so as to snatch kisses from breathless and teens trying to sneak onto trains chaste kisses that is there's no lechery here br br long suffering wife is obsessed with saving enough money to insure that the couple individually and jointly have a grand funeral an event the life loving frantisek is in no hurry to experience br br disagreements about money and promiscuous disposition of marital funds lead to a crisis whose resolution rings both real and endearing fishes for the viewer's emotions but he does it openly honestly and effectively br br autumn spring subtitled of course is a product of an increasingly vibrant czech cinema it wasn't shown widely in the u s but its availability on dvd will hopefully bring this affecting flick to a wide audience sadly recently succumbed to cancer so this movie is a to a fine actor who imbued his character with a passion for life's pleasures that must have reflected the actor's own values br br 9 10
<START> no one can say i wasn't warned as i have read the reviews both user external but like most of us attracted to horror movies curiosity got this cat come on we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room but you know that's horror aficionados are always dying to know what's in there even if we know it'll be bad br br the bottom line is that this movie left me angry not because it pretends to be real who cares gimmicks are allowed or because the actors and dialogue are so lame is this an unusual event in horror movies or even because the movie is so bad and i am being polite here what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp but also a half hearted lazy rip off at that br br i don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them but they didn't even try the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror or any movie
<START> yes i have noticed that there are other comments i think that is a good sign for a movie even if some are negative i have seen this movie 2 and a half times i adore it and would watch it again it is very smart but i can understand why some people would hate it they don't get it's appeal yes i have a weird taste in movies but this is a great movie some of the lines are just so quick like the whole scene in the chinese restaurant i started dying laughing that and when he was in the assembly line talking to the contact jude law was wonderful though it was humorous him trying to cover up his wonderful accent anyways i do not consider myself the movie goddess as some critics of this movie and if you have nothing better to do than write pseudo intellectual movie commentaries about films you hate online i feel sorry for you why don't you write about movies you like like me i just love how everything ties together it keeps you guessing even though you guess wrong the ending was interesting and not overdone it was purely clever i would not compare it to the matrix because i think people then get the wrong idea i went into this movie expecting nothing except jude law and a sci fi i was blown away i have no clue about any other of films but love this on its own merit another clever thing was the foreshadowing with the dog definitely watch this movie
<START> i decided to watch this movie because it has been noted as the scariest movie ever so that's what i expected unfortunately what i found out is that the movie didn't have a single scary moment in it and i'm the kind of person who jumps very easily the movie was nothing but terrible clichÃ©s and every time there was a jump moment it was incredibly obvious the pros of this movie would be the music and the odd scene thats actually shot well like the very last scene when she opens the door and you see in the reflection and when it swings back to him you see the ghost on his shoulders overall this movie really added nothing new to the j horror genre and all around lacked creativity and scares
