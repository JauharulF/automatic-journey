<START> one of the things that i like about pt anderson is that he has the guts to take talent that most people push to the side or have pushed to the side and makes them stars case in point a washed up burt reynolds delivers a great performance in this film and if proving adam sander can be a great actor punch drunk love wasn't enough here comes mark like you've never seen before br br i think many people pass up boogie nights cause they are anti porn or just flat out hate the adult industry and can't overlook that aspect of this film but underneath that is a great story about characters losing everything and battle to regain themselves there is a beautiful film and it's too bad that enough people see that
<START> there are too many people on this board who have obviously missed the subtle wit of this series br br this show is great because it's a hilarious parody of itself guys who are self proclaimed studs are given a fair chance to convince us of their seduction abilities until they hit the field just to expose their complete lack of game on national tv Â it's absolutely hilarious and the guys who are actually skilled are extremely compelling to watch as they effortlessly seduce the pretentious women that frequent these trendy nightclubs br br it celebrates unique charisma when deserved and mocks delusional when deserved either way it's always entertaining because unlike other dating shows it perfectly captures the authentic awkwardness and excitement of a pickup i highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor
<START> and quite frankly that just sums it up br br it is a small computer animated series that is filmed just like an animal br br the animation is almost flawless i thought the long necked swimming dinosaurs eyes looked fake br br however some of the model shots didn't look quite that realistic br br and i thought that park made a better t rex br br if this is the type of thing we see on a normal british tv series then i cannot wait to see what they can accomplish in the movies br br i give this 10 10 stars br br and the making of video was also great the dinosaur on the skate board was br br
<START> san 1 out of 10 so you want to make a serial killer movie but your budget is non existent your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are joe estevez martin sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies and todd bridges from different strokes there are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film the quiroz brothers have no clue br br first of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make bridges and estevez look like oscar caliber thespians really how hard is it to play a priest or an overbearing mother certainly a city the size of san francisco has a few professional actors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit clearly chris angelo and bonnie steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper or waitress they ought to be fine tuning br br joe rosete as the killer yes the serial killer is simply known as the killer is also pretty awful in a mentally ill method kind of way but i am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as his character is written with zero style or personality a boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie br br in addition the quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an abc family movie of the week there is no nudity or violence to speak of and the r rating clearly is for the adult style pacing this move meanders like an 85 year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on the only occasional horror comes from lighting face with a glare that makes it look like his lower jaw was removed br br i wasn't expecting a great film when i rented san but i wasn't expecting mind numbing boredom either
<START> to call x m a science fiction classic is due more to its release date 1950 its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for destination moon and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as sea hunt's mike nelson dad and wyatt earp br br the movie itself is bad enough to be good fodder for mst3k and is best viewed with commentary from joel and the robots this is the type of movie best suited to added riffing from the mst3k characters something preachy slow paced poorly scripted and full of painfully bad acting while unintentionally funny stuff like plan 9 from outer space don't lend themselves to satirical commentary because the movie constantly upstages the hosts really bad and dull movies like x m are ideal so add some stars to the rating if you are watching the mst3k version br br the basic story has the crew taking an unplanned right turn at the moon and ending up on mars what they find on that planet are the remnants of a human like civilization devastated by an atomic war only one martian is shown in close up a normal looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes the men look like the goons in the old popeye cartoons they scamper around the cliffs and throw boulders at the crew with amazing accuracy especially if they are supposed to be blind of course none of this is ever explained as doing so would require some sign of logical analysis from the writers of the screenplay br br the scenes on mars are presented in something called sepia color to distinguish them from the rest of the b w movie if this has you thinking wizard of oz you will be disappointed because it is just black and white stuff with a slight brown tint added to the print in post production br br in keeping with the moronic sexism of the movie the icy female scientist screws up her fuel calculations both coming and going her failure to measure up to the men causes her feminine side to surface and she and mike nelson coo sweetly to each other as they face their doom insert sound of gagging here br br the real stars of the movie are the reporters at the command center so much so that mst3k was inspired to specially salute these unheralded heroes the intrepid squad of are featured for the first 10 minutes of the movie then take stations about 12 inches behind the technicians and monitoring equipment in the command center later they are called upon to ask the moronic questions needed by the mission director to expound on the movie's already too obvious message br br the dvd has an extremely low audio level is not captioned and is accompanied by a trailer although you will be thankful that it is only 77 minutes it is still about 60 minutes too long as any 30 minute episode of the twilight zone has several times more content than this entire movie br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i think that this movie is actually entertaining although it lacks some features essential for this kinda' films first of all when doug and chappy start their mission they take off with f and during the combat scenes they are piloting f the second thing i dislike of this film is the ever repeating f 16 rolling to its right to escape from missiles why and flares haven't been shown in any movie yet third of all once you see the f 16 almost empty of ammo it appears again plenty of missiles the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft ain't good either however i think that using as opponent planes was really good far better than the f 5 shown in top gun but this movie isn't as good as that masterpiece br br a funny movie i love planes and i've seen it more than 3 times
<START> this movie is simply awesome it is so hilarious although the skating and other montages are played out the comedy is awesome himself and brandon are hilarious there will be moments when you can't breath you're laughing so hard plus there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh this is one of the funniest comedies i've ever seen
<START> vicente has made a terrible historical movie it shows the poor resources of the spanish cinema in the movie an script shows just as a faced to worried only for sex but sex with others not with her the technical mistakes begin with the wedding ring that shows isabel of nobody noticed that then the voice in off seems as a documentary actors and actress in the movie sometimes laughs take a look to the sequence when arrives to the council which want to keep her isolated the castles are almost broken when in the age of the movie they have been recently built crowds are just four people lights are bad placed compared with amelie poulain the french movie for the oscars it has no sense to speak about a bad movie like la
<START> i was going to use 'the german scream' as a summary but that was already taken lol it sums up anatomy nicely provided you're not alien to reading subtitles anatomy fits in snugly with the scream urban legend pack it's a teen horror set in a medical school where the students are going missing then turning up as experiment subjects in the dissection lab cue one plucky student investigating herself and uncovering a giant conspiracy br br provided you're watching the original german language film i can't comment on the dub having not seen the english edition anatomy is sharply written and cleverly plotted so that the tension never really lets up in comparison to it's american counterparts the mystery is uncovered much faster meaning that instead of being a slasher right up until the final reveal anatomy evolves during it's running time from a slasher come body horror movie into a smart and exciting thriller it's a gripping ride from start to finish br br hats off to the actors involved as well franka potente proves once more that she's an intelligent smart actress who can make any role come to life her central performance as paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from the spooky and their teachers pets are equally good a truly foreboding presence at all times br br it's also astounding that the movie doesn't drag much the pace is fast and punchy very similar to the earlier urban legend meaning that there's always something going on to keep your attention high if there's one downside it could be that some will find anatomy too gruesome for them but if you persevere through the first half's admittedly graphic dissection sequences the latter half with it's exciting thriller overtones will reward you i recommend anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teen horror but is a bit jaded with the american take on the matter
<START> this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it to make little like it which made it even stupider even some of the names were unrealistic the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie the most upsetting one was danny trejo a horror movie actor who is always dirty the other actors were pretty much clean as far as i'm concerned
<START> a ghost story on a typical turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects brothers had made their first shots on a tv show a couple of years ago as far as i know that was kind of a turkish x files they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects this time it seems they had what they needed and used them well this movie will make you laugh that's for sure and as well it might have you scared it has a nice plot and some young bright actors in it if you are a high school student in turkey you will find so many things about you here there are many clues in the movie about its story and ending some you understand at the moment some will make sense afterwords the dialogs were written very cleverly so these make the movie one of the best movies made in the last years do not forget this movie is the first of its kind in the turkish film industry
<START> not sure i've ever seen a black comedy from before but this is quite good actually the humor is suitably low key and deadpan to go with some of the gruesome activity and are fed up with working for their boss because he's always putting them down in fact he mentions that they weren't bright enough to unzip before peeing at one point they do what they have to to start their own butcher shop and when a workman is accidentally locked in the cooler overnight while fixing a light they hit upon something that makes their butcher shop far more popular than their old boss's in fact he's the one they sold their first to and it's partly his fault since he served them at a rotary dinner at his house and the guests raved about it and showed up at and the next day is somewhat horrified what has done but it doesn't stop there has risen above his sad little existence to be someone of some popularity which is new for him and he doesn't want to let go of that so the freezer continues to fill up with all manner of acquaintances and at one point a small swede from the park arise though because ex boss thinks something is wrong is also haunted by his twin brother who lived in a sanitarium for years in a coma and whom wanted the plug pulled on so he could get inheritance money to help open the shop when was taken off the he was revived much to horror and has a love interest too in astrid who works at the cemetery neither nor are well adjusted individuals and so things start to spiral out of control the deadpan humor really makes this and while this isn't exactly laugh out loud material it certainly is amusing it is somewhat creepy though considering the cuts of meat and body parts casually lying around especially since these two take it all so matter of fact if you're a fan of black comedies this is recommended i liked it quite well myself 8 out of 10
<START> did you ever watch a really bad movie and get mad about it even a movie you didn't have high expectations for well i just rented the movie dead line this is the us video title for now i have seen a lot of bad movies and watched a lot of b titles but this is in another league all its own it was put out on the asylum label and anyone that rents a lot of direct to video horror films knows this label when you rent one of there's you know what your getting a lot of marginal acting low budget horror but usually still pretty good not this one the acting by the three leads was beyond bad even fast forwarding couldn't help the tag line on the front of the box says in the tradition of depalma's body double the nerve to compare this to that classic movie the only true comment is the screams you will hear are real yea you will be the one screaming if you rent this
<START> man this would have been a bad episode of the original series i can't believe they actually spent money on this one i caught the second half of this on tv and having never seen this one before thought i would watch it boy what a waste of time more cheese than wisconsin br br
<START> i've never saw the first three but i know they're all better than this trash it's about some kid who throws a party wow sounds amazing sarcasm is it nooo it starts off with a kid laying in bed and he's getting woke up by his mom so the kid pretends to be sick so he doesn't have to go to school he goes to his uncle's house and rounds up some people and throws a party i didn't laugh at all while watching this trash i can't imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking man dis is gunna be big yo makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie i watched this knowing it would be bad but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of this just disgusted me two thumbs down
