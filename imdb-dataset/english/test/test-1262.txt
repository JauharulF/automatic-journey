<START> is the best movie of vijay one of the biggest hit in his career as i had not seen the movie so i could enjoy this movie even more the story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine vijay who had come to play a match there sees this and decides to help her the rest of the movie is how vijay helps her how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon the father's political cronies the movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end vijay is as usual very good in role of the player the bunch of vijay friends all have done their job competently a special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie the villain's character has been properly etched out and has portrayed it very well surprisingly for the first time i felt sympathy for the villain in the end the dialogue hi has really caught on with the masses the music by is brilliant and the song is a rage all over has to be credited with such a nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by the general tamil movie audience all over the world
<START> the first disney animated film without the strong involvement of disney himself this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting this is i believe the only animated disney film since the 1940's which is not based on an earlier book or other work but is rather an original story as others have noted the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in lady and the tramp and the kidnapping journey home story in 101 dalmatians br br but to overcome this flaw the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the disney animated films of the previous 10 15 years phil harris from the jungle book voicing one of the main characters follows his duet with louis prima in the previous film with another here with scatman crothers the quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from dalmatians with some nice nods to french impressionism it appears and the villain here the butler is strongly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well this is probably one of disney's least memorable villains the main story goes back and forth between the cats and the butler's ongoing difficulties with two rural hound dogs with great voice work by pat and george lindsey the various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen tramp and dalmatians the owner while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in sleeping beauty bears none of that character's nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous br br the real strength of the film is the voice work after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in the jungle book the tactic is continued strongly here with disney veterans harris and sterling holloway from the jungle book and eva gabor who would do a very similar character in the later film the rescuers as well as crothers and nancy all are excellent here particularly harris and gabor in the leads the character animation is as excellent as one would expect showing a variety of emotions well br br smaller children may be upset by a few brief episodes an escape from the path of a speeding train a near drowning by one of the children but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly overall there's very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other disney classics br br one minor oddity is the way some visual aspects of 60's culture are depicted among the jazz performing cats in supposedly 1910 paris one can't help but wonder why the story wasn't set solidly in the present other than the great deal paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time it really would have made more sense that way br br the songs while being pleasant and sometimes very enjoyably performed are not particularly memorable nonetheless the general energy applied here the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses far from the greatness of classic 10 s such as pinocchio or aladdin and not quite up to the 9 s one might give to sleeping beauty or 101 dalmatians this is probably a rather marginal 8 of 10 perhaps a 7
<START> one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint br br this movie has you guessing throughout and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen there are no bad guys or good guys makes sure of that the characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them you care about what they have been through br br use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of fast food movies and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable you love the feeling it gives you br br i have heard it said too often that there are no new stories to tell thank you for proving that false br br run don't walk to see this movie
<START> i had enjoyed the masters of horror series until i came upon this infantile dung heap br br this anti bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original batman done by michael moore political satire should be clever this however pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an l ron hubbard film br br in its campy inane way it accuses the republicans of stealing elections going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder it even takes a swipe at the second amendment and religion all that was missing was caesar romero as the president cackling in glee about how he orchestrated 9 11 br br i guess the ending was supposed to be the we support our troops moment but i think they would be more offended than pleased with the entire endeavor br br i'm sure the hollywood elites are sitting in their mansions patting each other on the backs for this pithy work while the anti war drones hail it as genius br br time to get fitted with new hats kids
<START> previous commentators have noted the similarity in appearance between this film and the third man director carol reed's classic film noir starring orson welles and joseph cotten this similarity strikes the viewer almost immediately it is indeed high praise to be compared to robert academy award winning cinematography in the third man br br the plot of stolen identity also has been delineated fairly accurately but in rather ordinary terms i found it highly creative and entertaining as common as the mistaken or stolen identity device is in both theater and cinema it is only a device and not to be mistaken for the plot itself consequently while the viewer may have seen this device a thousand times the plot of stolen identity is full of surprises and twists based upon this device it is the unexpected turns that make this film much fresher more original and engrossing than a plot synopsis might convey stolen identity doesn't rely on the kind of suspense that characterizes most film noire because there is no real mystery here instead it relies on constant smaller surprises in short the mistaken identity device is rather common but this plot is not br br finally although i was not familiar with the cast i found the acting to be uniformly good occasionally outstanding i easily could have imagined other actors turning this film into a melodrama with bombast overblown gestures and obvious facial expressions the acting is always more restrained and subtle donald is especially restrained and credible never blowing his cover with an obvious facial expression as we see too often in films that depend on the maintenance of subterfuge to sustain dramatic tension br br the only disappointment in this otherwise fine film was the very weak development of the love story sub plot as it stands it seems like an afterthought a mild surprise in fact tacked on to the end or perhaps during their shared ordeal the actors simply couldn't convey a palpable level of chemistry that i could appreciate this sub plot should have been made more apparent as the story unfolded all in all i thought this film was a fine little gem and i wondered why i had not seen it before try it you'll like it
<START> the last time i laughed this much it's a testament to the talent of rowan atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality without hardly ever speaking a word the whole success of the program rests on atkinson's shoulders but he carries it with ease despite the fact that the show only ran for one season anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber faced social so great is the talent and effort put into the performance at times exasperating at times lovable mr bean is an innocent unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate the brilliance of this character cannot be put into words you have to see for yourself br br the show gets almost too depressing at times like in the infamous new year's eve sketch or when bean celebrates his birthday by going alone to a restaurant offering himself a congratulatory card signed by himself and being served a stake he doesn't quite fancy still there are times when you can't help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which bean gets himself out of trouble like when he disposes of said stake in numerous clever ish ways or when he changes into swimming trunks without taking his trousers off first whatever your reaction to bean and his unorthodox lifestyle you're bound to throw fits of laughter while watching br br finally i'd like to point out that although bean is classified as a program for children it is just as enjoyable for any grown up with a sense of humour because the more adult jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick yes there is such a thing is funny no matter what age you are bean is the truest definition of a family show this is justly a classic and it always brightens up my day
<START> this film is probably the best new french film i've seen in this century so far there have been some great ones including noe's irreversible green's le pont des arts and none of them come close to les amants timeless glory br br the movie is a description of the events of may 68 and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of and a homage to the nouvelle vague movies of those days concerning the depiction of the riots in paris the movie is meticulously accurate i'm only 19 and i wasn't there myself but you know what i mean and the almost real time and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events in the streets of paris the riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed like the ones in bertolucci's the dreamers to which the movie is comparable in many ways instead they are filmed in grimy black and white shots courtesy of the excellent william the love story that is the movie's main concern after the riots in 68 is filmed in stunning and far less blurred shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environment br br this film is a beautiful love story and it radiates through it that the director wants to depict his own experiences of those mythical late 60's which makes the film all the more compelling but the film is also a homage to the whole nouvelle vague canon much of the dialogue evokes early truffaut and the length and non action and plot less structure is reminiscent of eustache or rivette there are even godard like effects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing bertolucci directly this film is no doubt an answer song to bertolucci's the dreamers and it is also a nouvelle vague homage but still it stands by itself as a beautiful and radiant love story br br bottom line this movie is incredible and if you love french cinema you shouldn't sleep on it it may be the finest french film since eustache's la et la putain
<START> granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of cinema br br the script was diabolical so bad in fact that i was almost crying with laughter at some of the things they came out with the acting was almost as bad they would have been better off casting traffic cones to play the roles they would have done a better job the murders were laughable the suspense was non existent the camera work was ineffective and the major plot twist at the end was disgustingly inappropriate it just gets worse and worse br br the granny is possibly one of the most unthreatening villains caught on film she looks like she is wearing a cheap mask from the supermarket the hair caused endless amounts of laughter and a frilly nightgown would you be scared by that i certainly wasn't br br if you like watching bad movies see manos troll 2 michael bay films then this is a must see those who don't like bad movies and don't enjoy laughing at shockingly bad dialogue avoid like the plague
<START> if there were an for film then this movie would get their most sincere approval if we all recycled our stuff to this degree we'd never run out of anything br br funny how i was reminded of this movie when i first saw i the phantom menace at least lucas didn't recycle his old footage br br this is a dud but it's a nice dud cute in spots i liked when the kid said damn rocks and if you like explosions even recycled ones you will get your fill br br actually for an obviously no budget film it makes out fairly well acting is weak but there is a little characterisation here and there story is predictable but will lead you along anyhow br br this is an everybody chases the kid type of movie which probably will appeal mostly to younger audiences i gave this one a 2 out of 10 br br i dug up my old vhs copy of this film i don't think it's on dvd
<START> ok this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked the zombie make up was extremely fake the acting is very poor and it doesn't really follow the first one while watching this i kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this i would say catch it on tv don't spend your money on it its not the worst movie i've ever seen but its on the list i started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again the plot was pointless i mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die they made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying if you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either the plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner with these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived out of a 1 10 i give it a 2
<START> this film is an absolute disgrace i thoroughly enjoyed the original airport and i can't believe how the same people could produce this twaddle nine years on first of all the acting is bad the original had actors who had done quality non disaster films before but this one uses actors who have done the disaster movie circuit already blakely kennedy wagner also george kennedy's character patroni seems to get promoted very quickly he is now the lead in the film but his character isn't strong enough to carry it off he has lost the charm and humour of airport 1970 and the character is now just boring have i mentioned the plot is it at all believable that someone would send a missile after the concorde no there are also too many loose ends scenes that have no relevance whatsoever to the plot the scene where the hot air balloon lands on the runway the chase of the thief in charles de airport are two such scenes both would be interesting if only they had something to do with the actual story there also many unanswered questions why does patroni open the window and fire a flare at the other plane why does robert wagner's character kill himself he must have another stupid and costly way of why is there no enquiry after the missile almost blows up the concorde why are the back projections so bad it looks as though a cartoon missile is following the concorde although it does work well when the plane lands in paris why does patroni think that he is in a flight simulator when he turns the concorde over why does he get a hero's welcome in the cabin of the plane after having terrified the passengers and why is the ending so poor if it can be called an ending at all given their one dimensional ness no one seems to notice this the blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's coach is the man who plays the saxophone is annoying and the woman with the bladder problem is just plain silly the scenes where susan blakely is lying on the roof of her conservatory and the when she tells wagner that she still loves him are quite awful in conclusion this film should have been the climax of the previous three airport films instead it is a diabolical sub moronic complete and utter waste of time money energy celluloid and talent remember when patroni asks the french pilot if he has ever landed on his belly this film certainly does the belly flop and lands flat on its pointy nose
<START> when i was younger and today mr bean is a work of genius three time bafta nominated rowan atkinson stars as the almost silent miming human looking alien dropped onto earth causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes he has tried to do an exam put his pants on in front of blind man he didn't know he was blind gone to church tried to dive at a swimming pool made lunch on a park bench seen a scary movie changed in his car had a picnic with a fly intruding spent christmas with his girlfriend matilda ziegler looked after a baby in been to room of the queens hotel in won a pet contest with his teddy driven on top of his mini on a new chair and even met and knocked out the queen guests included rudolph walker richard briers angus nick hancock from they think it's all over caroline quentin the day today's david schneider richard wilson the fast show's maynard and the vicar of roger lloyd pack it was nominated the baftas for best comedy programme or series and best light entertainment programme rowan atkinson was number 18 on the 50 greatest british actors he was number 24 on the comedians' comedian and he was number 8 on britain's favourite comedian outstanding
<START> the show was amazing and very professional madonna is a non stop dancing and singing for 2 hours the opening was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball and also jump was a really good performance the entire show was full of energy so it's kind of hard to say which were the highlights because every song had something special and unique i saw live couple of her previous tours drowned world and reinvention tour they were good but you can't compare with this one the dancers were fantastic the lights and the whole show were just perfect madonna still looks very good if you haven't seen it yet i highly recommend you to see it you'll enjoy the show from the beginning to the end madonna is still the dancing queen
<START> the beautiful country is a big disappointment it doesn't come up to my expectation a tall muscular guy is a son of an american gi and a vietnamese woman during vietnam war we were told that that he was treated less than dust in vietnam in the early 90s so he to america to seek his american father br br sounds like a heart broken material maybe but showing in this film i find myself having a hard time to connect to emotionally because the film is full of clichÃ© and i simply don't understand or believe him the writing of this film is a total failure the plot is full of holes it grabs some events on a needed basis trying hard to stir the emotion of the audience we are not that stupid and it doesn't work that way let's see what the film is trying to do so you don't feel boat trip yeah he was on a boat is hard enough let's have a storm over night and let the ship shake a little still not touched fine get a little kid to suffer the heat the hungry the sickness the violence with the adults on the boat hopefully that will do the trick to touch the audience still not touched you heartless sob let's ok i don't want to give any spoiler of the film but you get the idea br br the film is really long and slow it never tell us why didn't go to find his mom and dad until the moment in the film when he left to look for his mom and dad what has he been doing the 20 some years before he went to saigon to look for his mom and guess what he has the luck and everybody will tell him where to find the person he is looking for and he will find anybody without a scratch i really think the department of homeland security should hire those vietnamese who helped the beautiful country which one both vietnam and america seem hell to
<START> if i could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating i would i was stupid enough to pick this dvd up in the shop read the blurb and think that sounds quite good i'll spend Â£10 and buy it all i got at the end of it was a Â£10 coaster absolutely awful i don't even know where to begin i have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because i can't think of one good thing to say about it br br the plot is basically 7 people go into an unexplored cave one of them is a reporter no one else knows they are there when they get in the cave they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster there turns out to be no reason for the reporter one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume anyway the monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life this for no reason makes him superhuman able to glow see in the dark take bullets breathe underwater be in 2 places at once and have insane strength able to move boulders carry grown men as dead weight etc br br in the end scene there are 2 women left alive they wake up naked just covered in some bit of rug or something they then find a picture of a kid the monster then bursts in the door wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head says in the directors commentary it was a skull if so that would be the biggest crow i have seen in my life and quite literally goes like a kiddie on halloween i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave that is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one cut to end credits i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene br br there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end aside from all this the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off an absolutely terrible film you might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set fire to it it would be money better spent as like some clever person posting above me said once you've watched it you can't un watch it
