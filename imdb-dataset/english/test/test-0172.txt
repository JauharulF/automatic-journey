<START> it must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened br br the is peopled by such a miserable untrustworthy amoral spiteful unrelentingly dour group of characters as can be imagined everyone is stabbing someone in the back everyone is attempting to commit adultery everyone is trying to cheat someone that or they are being stabbed cuckolded or swindled nobody is cheerful nobody laughs nobody has a blinding stroke of luck or a really nice day it's hell with cockney accents br br i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the it's perfect viewing for the depressed it doesn't cheer them up what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sad arses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse they might be living in br br apart from the above as a representation of london's east end it is pure hokum the programme makers have evidently never been across town the first thing you encounter on the mile end road is a colossal mosque and this pretty well defines the racial majority of the population white british londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority a large advertisement hoarding presently near the bow road and sponsored by tower hamlets health care boasts that out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more ten healthy smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation eight of them are dark skinned br br what's more i used to work with a bunch of anglo saxon dare i say cockneys a few years ago and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience i've never had each day was like an oswald moseley rally they couldn't pass 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own and in terms that were repulsive and obscene and were the small change of conversation in fact their entire and extremely limited stock of adjectives fixated upon sex organs and their application alf garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison br br any programme that purported to represent london's native east end caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast even after the 9 o clock watershed imagine a ku klux klan script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark but when they weren't being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful br br i don't know how such a soap opera came to be this imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever and if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronic with cockney accents what's the point of that br br dull dreary unrelentingly and ethnically preposterous the most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation br br avoid it like the plague
<START> this is realism if rivette was seeking to give us a ground level study of a woman in a certain place and time and how she was able to influence and was influenced by the world around her he has failed miserably most prominently because we never get a clue as to why thousands of men would have followed her into battle there is certainly not enough exposition of the cultural historical context to define the country's need for such a savior and god knows there is nothing particularly charismatic about joan as she is presented here unless wooden posturing and flat line readings are supposed to indicate transcendent faith and determination the use of landscape is particularly uninspired we never lose the feeling we are watching twentieth century actors wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape and as for the battle scenes which in contrast to some commentors claims do take up a good 15 of screentime they look like look like some some history club from your local high school recreating a medieval siege although the kids would no doubt put more passion into it i will give rivette credit however for picturing a side of joan left out by other movies that of a petulant naive and narcissistic adolescent played by a woman all too clearly at least twice the age of the character she is supposed to portray obviously unable to understand her place within the movement she is helping to create or the world existing outside her own passions joan's outrage at her own soldiers swearing and astonishment at the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her are jarringly spontaneous and believable notes you suddenly realize such moments must naturally have occurred in an otherwise uninvolving historical representation unfortunately they also serve to point out precisely what is not addressed on screen what made joan special i must say i also continued to be puzzled and frustrated by certain foreign film lovers who equate tedium and lack of dramatic involvement with artistry and seriousness does this film really increase our understanding or involvement with the subject or with anything for that matter 4 10
<START> well of course the critics hated it this isn't a movie that's going for the big time critical acclaim but the fact is that it's really very good br br sure if you don't like that chris farley brand of physical comedy or the exceedingly dry wit of david spade you're not going to like it but for the rest of us the movie has many hilarious and for that matter quotable sequences and the plot isn't half as dumb as that of black sheep the parts that aren't meant to be humorous are actually done well not what you'd expect from a movie of this ilk and the acting is really pretty good br br tommy boy is without question chris best movie i give it an a and suggest you give it a view
<START> what a movie i have always liked the asian style of shooting and this movie does not disappoint at all photography is breath taking ranging from amazing landscapes to whirls of colours the main actor is really realistic in representing the painter whose paintings are astonishing the ending is also very well chosen very poetic the only remark is that they should have maybe shown a bit more deeply the connection between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women but altogether this is an excellent film
<START> occasionally funny but generally boring i did recognize robert from welcome back carter aka epstein as the ex celebrity criminal there is a knee slapping gut busting scene with the french lady having a bad reaction to american food s baio s kellerman and tom arnold are billed but have only minor roles you never get to know the characters and it's hard to care what happens to them not recommended
<START> sometimes i wonder if today's horror movies rely on human torturing to make people scared if so then there's a sad future for horror movies dee snyder tries to make you feel scared and terrified this movie does exactly this but not in a good way now there are some moments in the film where that there is a chance that snyder is saving this film from falling into a hole but let's be frank this movie didn't fall into a hole it was already in a hole and makes no attempt whatsoever to bring itself out of it when you finish watching this movie you are left sick depressed dirty and insane i have a feeling that was the intention of this movie what is lower than dirt

<START> any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter day peer in my opinion respectfully the of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive as a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare i favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things for those unacquainted with target priorities an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing rank and british studios back in the day frankly i prefer its quieter more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over produced hollywood movie ever could this reminds me of powell and pressburger's the 49th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman a favorite of mine john mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles so this is clearly meant to be mr portman's film but the whole cast shines as for the title sequence am i the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough production's lovely pre cgi gainsborough girl
<START> dillon fishbourne reno should have teamed up for a much smarter effort because this one slides in the b category and could have been done with no name actors and a much smaller budget since anyway 2 armored trucks and a wasted warehouse could not have coasted too much since the writers did not manage to come with a smart heist plan they targeted the dramatics of the situation but there was not much to exploit there either fishbourne and reno do not bring anything to this movie except the media interest they're only expensive advertising dillon is ok but this was a walk in the park the choices of the main character ty hackett are quite uninspired and the final with the reward is quite childish waste of time money actors and so on
<START> meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970's this movie plays more like something mr schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway a mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in florida and along the freeway of life the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor the problem is that what didn't end up on the cutting room floor probably should have now available on dvd it's kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost 100 million to produce had it been made in 2004 it rolls along and isn't too difficult to sit through and strangely enough in 2004 we're all still pretty much just br br hopping in our cars and going faster and faster heading nowhere
<START> let me just give you guys some advice if your going to watch this movie just to see a bunch of unlikable characters get slaughtered in a dozen different ways then you are going to love this movie because everyone dies a horrible death beyond the gore however there is not much else br br where should i start the characters do not appeal to the audience as there are no back stories for any of them there for i didn't feel connected to any of them in fact i didn't like any of them and i was so sick of them that by the end of the movie i was rooting for the disfigured creep to kill them all which he did by the way br br bad acting i mean i didn't get it take the asian tour guide for example first he spoke perfect english then after their little tour boat thing sunk he somehow got an accent out of the blue then later on went to speaking normal english br br one of the worst endings for a horror if you can call it that after the monster human mutant thing kills almost everyone he is killed by the last two remaining idiots or so they thought the monster human thing is finally killed when the beauty and the geek stick a pole through its heart nick it was hard to tell and presumably it died right in front of them within arms reach but later on it comes back and kills them wtf i mean why didn't it just kill them when he was right next to them i mean it was just way too retarded it was like the writer didn't know where he wanted the story to go or he was a few minutes short of 80 min so he added some more retarded twists to the movie so people can get 80min worth of crap instead of br br what i didn't get was why didn't they just kill the damned thing while it was unconscious instead they just walked away from it like idiots and left it so it could come back and kill them the only reason i gave it a 4 was because of the gore which was actually the only thing that i watched this movie to the end for that and to watch them all get killed no i'm serious
<START> well i'm not a movie critic or something like that but i have my opinion for this movie i think that the best in this movie was amanda bynes she played her roll for my look very well i have watched many her movies this i liked most when you are watching this movie you just can relax come down and watch it you don't have to try to look for subtext or something like that you just watch it movie is really great maybe i liked it for actress maybe for all the scenery but i liked it the whole atmosphere that was created in one moment i just felt like i was in that university in that room it is not another drama movie that is made to win oscar it is just nice movie to watch in your free time
<START> early jackie chan film where there is no sign of the chan persona we know this is chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re cloned by countless producers and studios all through hong kong taiwan and mainland china its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult jackie chan to super stardom its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short as a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie i was watching it in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that i watched that day had i not noticed jackie in the film honestly i don't think the film is really worth bothering with there are too many other better variations except if you're interested in seeing where jackie chan started
<START> this movie is so bad that it actually gets funny one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my entire life the funny thing was that the trailer had scenes in it that wasn't in the movie just by watching the trailer i would have saved a lot of my time it actually showed everything that happened in the movie except for the conclusion and that was also so obvious br br it's honestly hard to think of a reason why this movie was made this is just so bad horrible br br i would give it 0 out of 10 if that would be possible there is nothing else to say about this movie
<START> in the world of shorts most of which aren't this film is a gem br br a quiet concise peek into the world of a young woman who's a reader for a blind woman here the stellar elizabeth franz this film bears the textures layers and visual storytelling of a sumptuously painted still life br br the dialogue is minimal the cinematography is stunning and the direction sure clear and compelling i saw this film in a film festival held in a loud and crowded tribeca bar and within the first two minutes and for the first time that night the crowd fell quiet br br that says it all
