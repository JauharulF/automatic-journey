<START> dull acting weak script worst spanish movie in years i was br br attracted by the naked beauty of paz vega but as an actress br br she's useless you almost can't understand what she's saying br br about the story there's not much coherent to say we heard of it br br before but as this is a modern carmen we find a few changes the french soldier is now a basque soldier himself is a character in the story carmen is a dangerous in love with a famous br br matador and she can speak fluent basque br br can anyone understand this mess
<START> this is so poor it's watchable br br the plot deals with a grizzled spaceship crew happening upon a drifting apparently abandoned russian craft br br in the empty vastness of space the two craft accidentally collide and 'alien' esque fun ensues as a cyborg from the russian ship menaces our crew br br the spacecraft interiors are clearly a dolled up factory set metal walkways boilers piping in this entirely unconvincing setting and the rest of our hero crew grimace grunt run about and continually and repeatedly rack their shotguns without firing them br br the continuity gaffes are what define this movie and they are nothing short of amazing br br stuff appears and disappears the shotguns are racked a cigar gets longer by being smoked the shotguns are racked again just to make sure content of a bottle increases by being drunk from br br the film progresses through the usual clichÃ©s by way of intense ham acting poxy camera work and ed wood quality props to a showdown climax
<START> i have vague memories of this movie being funny br br having seen it again either i have changed or i was thinking about a another film altogether br br it seems as if we are supposed to be sympathetic to jackie mason's character however nothing in the movie actually engenders that emotion its notable that he is really the only person accorded tender dialogue with loved ones no one else's character is allowed to rise to the status of even vaguely human br br i don't even like golf but as the film went on i found myself really rooting for stack and the club guys really hoping they would repel mason and chevy chase
<START> this outlandish troma movie is actually a very good movie it is known as their epic and best and most highly rated production their version of shakespeare's play is extremely funny with the usual dose of troma nudity and gore troma has made some very good gore films one of my favorites is street trash and of course the toxic avenger movies i have one troma movie terror firmer which has a reputation as their goriest and nastiest movie i enjoyed tromeo and juliet so much that i need to finally watch terror firmer this is a 2 disc collector's version with four commentaries and many many features tromeo and juliet is an absolute hoot and highly recommended
<START> if you only see one ernest movie in your life make it this one this is by far the best in the series with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages the other ernest flicks were good too but most people tend to get tired of him quickly not me however br br in this movie ernest p is assigned jury duty for a murder case the murderer nash just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest mr nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammer br br a great flick if you haven't already seen it watch it
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the sci fi channel here is how the movie starts women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is a ok as long as it only targets soldiers in case your wondering men however the virus back fires big shock and all the men on earth slowly die then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man now we are taken around 60 to 70 years from now two female scientists are working on cloning a female baby and one of them says hey why don't we bring men back the other one says no the world is not ready for that but promptly ignores her and thus a man walks the again br br first off this movie assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood thirsty monsters secondly the writer forgot to mention that present day soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers so there is no real reason to have a virus like that this is the biggest waist of time you can find this movie managed to insult my intellect not only by the bad story but with the lifetime style acting avoid this movie at all costs br br i give this a 1 out of 10 but only because i could go no lower
<START> lucille ball's version of mame in my opinion is one of the worst performances ever saved to film after seeing lucy in her various sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times i can tell you that i really love lucy however this movie is a fiasco of unbelievably bad casting music and dancing robert preston is the only saving grace with a part tiny enough to miss if you blink i don't know what she was thinking and i can't imagine how she was advised by the studio or director but i actually cringed watching this embarrassing performance i could be really cruel and suggest watching it for a laugh but it's too pitiful even to qualify for that don't waste your money or your time
<START> i read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it i'm a big francophile and art film lover but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not i will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never ever wanted to actually see obviously the piano teacher has some major psychological issues but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically the film is in essence disgusting i mean when i saw requiem for a dream i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film
<START> if you watch this series you will get an interesting 10 chapters about a sleeper story and each characters and more intense with a fbi's infiltrate br br nice story nice characters and performs but something is wrong for me of course the final is wrong you wait ten chapters hoping a great final it doesn't matters if they fulfill its objectives or not but well i think is not enough its a small final for a big series also i hoped more definitions about characters stories br br but i repeat it's and interesting miniseries if you don't want to wait with large series 22 24 chapters watch it i give 7 of 10
<START> this was the most god awful movie i have had to sit through 30 minutes into the film and i couldn't take any more seriously do not bother with this one unless you are a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo arty types that like this kind of tripe so that they may feel more cultured boring although the acting is fine the kid is just plain irritating some scenes are a little strange with very weird close ups i don't know why they did the whole movie in black and white but whatever effect they were hoping to have failed miserably there was just nothing to watch and although its a sad tale supposedly its just so stupid that its hard to feel any sympathy for the characters
<START> goldeneye 007 is not only the best movie tie in game of all time but it is perhaps the most influential first person shooter ever to hit the gaming console market if you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem because essential it is the same as the popular james bond movie goldeneye which was released in 1995 two years prior to this game's release br br this is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives and difficult challenges the a i is smart especially on higher difficulty settings and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment as well as difficulty to any gamer br br the introduction of logical hit points on your enemies is a great feature even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well aimed shot to the head it is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your james bond and that you can sneak in sneak out covertly taking out henchmen as you go or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts because of this there are many ways to beat the game and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks aka you can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself which i might add is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away br br this is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry each time i play it i notice aspects that have been replicated in many following fps games so if you have a nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of goldeneye 007 because trust me as a bond fan and a casual gamer i can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of james bond or just have an awesome intense gaming experience br br also make sure to look out for its sister game perfect dark which is also on the n64 following the same controls and very similar weapon uses
<START> for most people robocop 3 is the film that really is the big disgrace for the robo series it has few fans and most people hate it for it's shameless commercial pg 13 approach now i'm not going to say that robocop 3 is any good frankly it pretty much sucks but as far as being a properly shot and executed film it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos yes the truth of the matter is that robocop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a near masterpiece so what if robocop 3 turns robo into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy at least it's doing it openly i don't know where robocop 2 begins and ends i don't know what or whom it's about i don't understand what's going on in it i don't understand which jokes are deliberate and which aren't i will go insane if i try to understand the characters i see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying i can't believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and i can't believe that irvin kirshner saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see he probably didn't by the way neither miller nor weller nor allen did it's not hard to see why br br now robocop 2 has it's fans i know this mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti pretensions dismissing anybody who expected any depth or subject matter from the first film as academic roger ebert sith it's just a lot of fun a good piece of action and great entertainment the argument goes yeah well i guess if you just don't listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have arnold in the suit instead of weller don't get me wrong i like a good action film with pure entertainment value as it's only most satisfying virtue but robocop 2 sir ain't no such thing br br look at the first couple of scenes this horrible actor makes robo repeat that he's just a machine and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man where after murphy's wife who's suing for robot stalkings walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him and then is never heard of again i surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene because every one has these kind of absurdities in them it's like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay the characters act totally random and first say this then say that wants to stop crime with a new robo especially this drug called nuke but then it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city Â politics are abandoned i guess understandable given the comic relief mayor the villain played by tom noonan who did a better version of this in last action hero and that's saying a lot is an addict but is still used for this machine the woman behind it all has an agenda which is impossible to understand br br speaking of twelve year olds this film has the infamous role of hub this mad kid who swears and kills people played by a child actor i'm not going to be all moral about it it's a free world and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie go for it i don't know how much of frank miller's original vision was put into this but the credits at least acknowledge him as of the story and if i zoom out i could see this as being quite a cool character it's grim for sure to have a maniac killer kid but then again this is the world of robocop and who would be surprised this whole business with the trying to become this giant monopoly over everything is properly dystopian and good as well also the idea of robocop getting in touch with his wife and kid having them embedded into the story somehow would also be great and as far as i can see a natural and logical step if they now had to make a robocop sequel br br but of course these are just ideas as many people have already said the screenplay is 100 mess the kid has one scene the torture scene where it's hinted that he in fact is just a stereotype messed up kid and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and gets all soft and friendly towards ol' tin head why doesn't he just take up his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath isn't that what his character would do does he give his life a little second thought there on his death bed not necessarily given that his last words are it sucks so why it really makes no sense and this can be said about everybody no everything in this film is there a strike in the police force is robocop machine or man what's the deal with turning robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes i mean sure it's pretty funny i wouldn't deny that but why build it up and then discard it and why the hell is allen so criminally underused and what is it weller has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah well the threads are many and the mess is enormous br br this review is just as messed up as the film the only reason i give an extra star up there is because of the actors from the first film i'm sure they had good intentions with it i mean it's something somewhat stable some kind of anchor in this sea of bad movie making
<START> quite a production from the director telling the story of the emperor's ambitious plan to unite all kingdoms of china some great characters sets costumes and scenes however i was not blown away by the film in terms of the actors ability which was good i enjoyed the marquis the most or its look although the massing of troops was extremely impressive if it was real man that is a lot of extras br br i have seen li gong in other movies and she is always great good period piece i think but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it good film and found the 2 1 2 hours not a problem br br rating 7 out of 10
<START> look some film has got to the be worst ever i suggest it may be india song when i saw the film in 1976 it was playing at the carnegie hall cinema a place frequented by people who care a lot about film from about the halfway point people were simply flooding out of the theater my girlfriend wouldn't let us leave but by the end the theater was virtually empty i kept telling people as they left that the good part is still to come and it was the good part was the screen at the end that said fin it was the only good part i am still annoyed by this film 24 years later it was pointless stupid and derivative marienbad part 2 see it only if you want to spend an endless two hours learning to distinguish between merely bad and simply awful
<START> a great show br br first to the people who don't like it don't like it then don't watch it br br this is was an awesome show better than according to jim a favorite of mine it shows a real family household as opposed to 8 simple rules etc where everything goes peachy br br they're loud they're messy i can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen it happens in real life sorta like the portal to hell and everyone growling like dogs over the fast food boxes br br it's a been there show you know what's coming but fun to watch because you have been there before br br a good cast they work great together a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release mel gibsons safety videos were a highlight of the series as well br br opinion good show really deserving of a dvd release deserving to not be canceled as well
