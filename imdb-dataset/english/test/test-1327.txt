<START> contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an against the system type of movie and attitude it is an excellent portrayal of the system in question and how ridiculous it truly is the funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life and that is to learn what you enjoy that is what college should be about br br i come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines i think i have given my opinion on the matter so i now write a couple more lines just as filler i hope you have been entertained during this time i encourage you to go see the movie it is well worth your while so long as you follow it and immerse yourself in the movie
<START> when all we have anymore is pretty much reality tv shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can't sing or cook worth a damn than i know hollywood has run out of original ideas i can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on tv in the last 15 years what is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves i would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before ok so people in this one need to lose weight most americans need to lose weight i just think we all to some degree enjoy watching people humiliated maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else looking like a jerk i don't know but i just wish something intelligent would come out that did not insult your intelligence
<START> i know everyone said this movie was utter crap and i agree with them i spent a few years after seeing it telling other people it was crap i recommended they not see it but when it came on tv we saw the ad i turned to family and said i know this is sad but i'm thinking of watching it my sister turned to me and said yeah me too and you know what it was funny br br by no means is this a good movie it's absolutely a waste of time but it's a good waste of time you may still think it's crap and fair enough but i thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy i didn't like a couple of bits like when the fish got hit by the car but apart from that i thought it was good i loved sitting there and picking out all the famous australian faces elle garry mcdonald etc br br so if you like to waste your time watch this movie otherwise see a drama or something
<START> i love this disney movie its a real cute movie and when it comes on again i will have to make a mental note to tape it i really like how they break into the bank trying to find parents information you should really see this movie its great for the whole family
<START> i knew i was in for a long 90 minutes when the opening voice over mispronounced the word 'scarecrow' it sounded like scare crew and sure enough 90 minutes later after witnessing beyond horrid acting tedious drama scarecrow's punches going nowhere near their intended target but hitting it anyway ken shamrock acting and the most stupid illogical ending i've seen in my life ok no i take that last one back in about a week after making it through all that i openly weeped that i couldn't just go to lacuna a la jim carrey and just erase it completely from my mind any thoughts i might have had that director brian might have made an ok film given the right circumstances that i had after watching slaughter studios are totally and completely gone from my mind now br br my grade f br br eye candy tara platt and lisa robert get topless br br where i saw it starz on demand available until september 22nd 2005
<START> coach preachy or straight sappy it's bad writing combined w even worse acting you can choose to drink the of this after school special but i didn't not even on it's 20th toby robbins islander philosophy motivational moment it's too much posturing to be entertaining and not substantive enough to be informative i have respect for the coach and the program this movie is inspired by but the move itself is awful as someone who has played rugby for nearly 20 years in the states i had hoped for a better rugby movie even one that has something loosely to do with rugby and i can tell you that the performed by a bunch of and islanders is not intimidating much like when it's performed today by the all blacks seriously boys everyone has seen it it's time to put it away if you want real intimidation line up across from a bunch of south africans the real eye gouging convicts of rugby this is a fake and badly done movie about being a genuine and good person
<START> if you ever plan on renting hopefully not buying this movie think again it was as if gary busey had a gun to his head and was forced to act or die i only wonder if busey was arrested for something and was sentenced to play in this movie because i just don't see the guy that acted so much better with keanu reeves in point break play in this disaster it was a feel good movie but there are thousands of other feel good movies that make you laugh without wanting you to get your money back br br the only reason i would ever tell someone to rent this movie is to watch this movie is to see gary busey jump up and down like a monkey if you want a good funny movie pass up quigley and go rent spongebob or something
<START> gary busey did a splendid job playing the rock n roll legend buddy holly 1936 59 he does have a spitting image to the man being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's having a group of three is usually simple back in those days i bet that buddy holly busey was a much better musician than most of what i heard since he lived in texas it was only a quiet country town back then his parents were christians though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work that's one of the reasons he didn't act like elvis he stuck to his kinder ways that really makes him good when he went to tennessee he saw how bad the producers were they hated rock n roll that turned holly off big time getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge to holly and his friends he got to tour with sam cooke went to the famous apollo which the all afro american audience quickly accepted them i liked that and sam cooke made sure holly and his band got some service that's what i call tolerance it's sad that he ritchie and j p the big bopper richardson had their music careers cut short by a plane crash in 1959 at least their memories will live on in our hearts i don't what inaccuracies were in the movie all i care is that buddy holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics in that time and the music is nearly perfect for gary busey he was perfect in the role and making the music as well god bless you gary busey 5 stars
<START> plot synopsis los angeles in the future crime is kept under control by core trackers android assassins dispatched by the united states computerized judicial system to execute the guilty secret service agent eric phillips prevents an attack on his boss senator robert dilly the man who set up the by the union for human rights a group of anti machine activists dilly attempts to initiate phillips into his private circle but the ss agent goes on the run after witnessing dilly murder a agent in cold blood dilly sends core trackers after him phillips joins the group helps them uncover a conspiracy involving dilly br br cyber tracker is the first of a number of sci fi action hybrids directed by richard pepin co founder of pm entertainment a powerhouse of action films during the 1990s other pepin films include hologram man t force the silencers dark breed pepin films typically start with a major action sequence which lasts about 10 minutes before allowing the plot to kick in the script for this film has a few plot holes Â it is never clear what the conspiracy the heroes are trying to stop actually is as for the acting don the dragon wilson may be tough but cannot act for beans with little charisma his co stars are a lot better the film's best bet are the action scenes which throw up some impressive artillery fire a huge bodycount not one but three moments where a vehicle flies through the air flips hits the ground exploding the visual effects border on the cheap side the musical score is low key shrill
<START> i watched sleeper cell with a bit of trepidation worrying over whether the terrorists would be glorified this mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter responsibly it created depth and substance to almost every character just gobbles up the screen in every scene he's even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell he still has hypnotic appeal michael held his own well though in some scenes i wondered why he wasn't shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his face br br the pros of the series are the two leads and the well written characters all of which were believable and tragic and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story having been married to a muslim myself the atmosphere created was quite realistic the cons for me personally were that the female t a was seemed gratuitous as well as some of the sex scenes despite that it is a raw gripping series that will make you think somebody give more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it he's got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him
<START> the magnificent greta garbo is in top form in this her first talkie she gets fine support from the rest of the cast which includes charles bickford the rugged sailor who captures her heart ms garbo gives a great performance as she usually does as the estranged daughter of a sea captain who returns after fifteen years also in the cast is that great actress marie dressler a great movie
<START> i think this movie can be called the movie of misdirected rage br br the characters of joe and bob were relics of the wwii generation who didn't quite understand their kids opposing the war taking drugs and listening to rock and roll but i think their real rage was at the fact that america was beginning her long decline from the heights the war left her at br br joe himself is a low rent archie bunker ranting at all the things that have made him angry living his life of quiet desperation until he teams up with compton a guy who wants to avenge himself on the hippies who ruined his daughter br br honestly most of the movie looks silly the characters are worse than one dimensional they're laughable peter boyle was capable of better stuff
<START> the only footage of zeppelin i've seen prior to this dvd is 'the song remains the same' movie from 1976 we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences br br so what of this dvd i didn't know it existed until browsing for the physical graffiti cd 'when did this come out ' i thought br br for some reason i thought that page wasn't a great live guitarist but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement br br there's 'white from 1970 10 minutes of guitar wizardry br br there's an acoustic set from 1975 y aur has a brilliant finger picking improv section br br the 'in my time of dying' and performances also from '75 are breathtaking with page and bonham tearing things to pieces like no one else ever has demonic possessions of br br the magic continues into the 1979 section the rendition of last considering their various drug addled states just beggars belief a song of complex guitar overdubs page arranged it in a way that lets him just it out' live the effect is totally mesmerising 'in the i never liked this on disc but it along here 'sick again' great piece of sleaze rock the footage from is very interesting cutting between big screen various and bootleg footage to great effect br br plant is amazing throughout all the performances page despite being painfully thin looks like a six year old kid having the most fun of his life at the concert and makes infectious viewing br br one thing that puzzled me the 'black dog' performance from 1973 sounds very up' robert plant always did love a little and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous and would warrant an arrest nowadays all very different from the muscle bound kick a studio version br br i love this dvd it has reminded me how good zeppelin were and remain
<START> i'm not gonna lie to say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really and if you've seen cult director richard kelly's previous films donnie darko and tales you know that's gotta mean something when i went to see this movie there were about 50 people in the theater before an hour into the film about half of the audience had already walked out by the end there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see i for one could only comprehend roughly 40 of what i saw on screen and even then it can only be called interpretation so why did i give this movie a generous seven stars because for one we get some spectacular performances marsden's great and langella returns as a familiar creepy character and most importantly two because it's entirely original and richard kelly undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different quite frankly it's the only way only through kelly's unique style could this story be told the way it's intended br br in the end if you're not willing to spend some serious thought into an intelligent movie and even then it may all amount to nothing stay far away from this one but if you want to watch a deep rich complex and thought provoking piece on spirituality existentialism and the predictability of human nature go see this be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner however br br note if by chance you've read this review taken my recommendation have actually seen the movie and still believe you've wasted 2 hours of your life i'd be happy to share my views on the whole meaning and plot of the film see that's why i liked it so much it promotes discussion as hard as it is though i'll try summing it up by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote by langella's character who explains the significance of the simple box to an employee your house is a box which you live in the car that you drove to work is a box on wheels when you return home from work you sit in front of a box with moving images you watch until the mind and soul rots and the box that is your body deteriorates when finally you are placed into the ultimate box to rest under the soil and earth
<START> let me get started with a terrible storyline and an awful control system good animation but not too good graphics that is why i'm giving this game 4 of 10 this game really needs an improvement if you ask me i would remake it and make this control system better so jaws is not so damn hard to control if i made it to improve it i would make those graphics look better than on the movie it will drive anyone crazy when you are getting killed so freaking easy i played this and got killed by a diver when he had one of those flick knives in 2 hits the dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will be begging to go to the bottom of hell this game sucks some fat ass sorry about all the cussing i think i'm done now it just that this game sucks so bad that it should be taken off the store's shelf i dare you to play the garbage and you will probably get so mad by dieing so easy so don't play it
