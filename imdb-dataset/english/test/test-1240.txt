<START> bon voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome most importantly though the film is also historically instructive it captures the tension of the so called phony war and later the french flight from paris ahead of the german onslaught yet bon voyage is not a war movie it is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times bon voyage conveys the chaos confusion and emotional bewilderment of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of french reactions to the new political order this film is a comedy which entertains the audience a romance which skillfully utilizes many clichÃ©s and a story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them
<START> this is one of those star filled over the top comedies that could a be hysterical or b wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead unfortunately one night at is a classic b br br goldie hawn recently commented about town and country that it's a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script they also mangled it daily maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say it's the script stupid br br this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through they're working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre br br is it an unmitigated disaster not entirely there are some smiles along the way mostly due to the efforts of the actors i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking eh it was okay so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review the ending if as it's been noted the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending then it misses spectacularly i really wish i could speak specifically about it but i hate people who give too much away even in warning suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent over paul reiser nothing given away here it's in the trailer get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking eh it was okay the rest of the movie is tacked on and creatively bankrupt and you'll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess br br if you loved there's something about mary or meet the parents both great movies then don't bother to see this movie go have those teeth taken care of instead
<START> i give flashdance a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos in order to clock in as a feature length film since when does that count as film jennifer beals plays alex owens an aspiring 18 year old dancer who incomprehensibly has a job as a in a pittsburgh steel factory not a line of work most older women find their way into much less 18 year olds fresh out of high school meanwhile at night she works as an exotic dancer who never actually takes off her clothes in a greasy spoon bar called yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at you would think they were working at the best casino on the las vegas strip br br alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss nick hurley michael who is about twice her age after resisting nick's advances because going out with the boss isn't a good idea she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date alex and nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to alex's co workers br br when beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious pittsburgh conservatory of dance inexplicably when her boss boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of she's throws one her tantrums she angrily tells nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel this is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this br br of course alex does eventually get her audition at the conservatory she puts on a dance routine before the conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the mtv generation oh yeah it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the mtv generation br br i don't think i can judge whether or not beals can actually act well on the basis of what i saw in flashdance this is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written that i don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities br br you have to hand it to the makers of flashdance though this movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign in this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on mtv if they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that i cared about instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously a truly forgettable film
<START> nothing like this was seen on tv at that time and probably never will again from the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words police squad in color you were to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom br br also to kill off a guest star and then never refer to him again where had you ever seen that before then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention you would miss several jokes in the background don't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry this was the show that video recorders were made for way before married with children or the simpsons br br the stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before realising that it was a joke br br the characters frank and ed came right out of dragnet and they were absolutely straight no funny accents or expressions but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan only once as i can remember were there a segment played for silly laughs a scene involving a trip to a dentist suction and a whole lot of saliva br br there were some tedious moments like the informer johnny and an appearance by some celebrity that was strictly a one joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes oh well everything can't be perfect the important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee deep in tears of laughter br br leslie nielsen was fortunate that this revived his career when they put the frank character in 3 features but it must have been an achilles heel as well can you remember seeing him in anything except naked gun type work since and don't count the awful mr magoo reworked for live action he probably made a lot of money though
<START> while this isn't an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy saturday morning with not a lot else going on right then br br harold lloyd plays ezekiel cobb an american coming home after growing up in china where his dad was a missionary he has come home from china to find an american wife and plans to return to china to continue his father's work cobb unwittingly is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the town's underworld they figure the bumbling stumbling cobb has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all rich br br lloyd isn't doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent films he does a convincing portrayal of cobb with a reserved understated dignity the acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good br br being made in 1934 the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes aren't nearly as mean as i've seen from other films from that time br br although not close to being lloyd's best film this movie does entertain and lloyd is very good as cobb you won't be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in lloyd and make you want to see more of his work
<START> but certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time br br i got this dvd cheap with sandra bullock as headliner on the case this is false advertising she's on screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie br br on the other hand there was no other selling point for this movie the dialog was horrible the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on quaaludes the directing was well let's just say that my 14 yo daughter could do better but i hope she never sees such faint praise from me it's possible that the family cat could have done better br br sandra does a creditable job for a first film in the short time she's on screen and that's the only redeeming quality of this film stupid story poorly written and transferred to film as only a 7th grade media class should be able to do br br in short this is dreck
<START> as the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them br br from the opening sentences you quickly gather that the actors are talentless the script editor was probably dead and the director should be to be honest i didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach br br i have never and i mean never seen a film as sweaty as this one and i watch tons of crap films br br turd
<START> other than it reassembled the characters from the first film and gave them more backstory essentially lucian the werewolf fell in love with sonia the vampire a romeo and juliet scenario you know is going to end badly if you've seen the first movie so with absolutely no suspense we blunder forward with two hours of unremitting cgi and actors with little or no screen presence all shot in that monotone color that the first movie had because nothing was shot in daylight br br worth your time probably not in fact the quality has gone down even the cgi looks like it was done on the cheap you don't buy for a minute that these are real werewolves
<START> the film deals with universal themes mentioning no specific country as its context it could happen anywhere and has in substance if not form those concerned about 1st amendment issues censorship et al but don't want to be bored with lectures need art such as this to illustrate dramatize teach inspire br br rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor he shines in this film showing off multiple acting talents that you must see i have yet to see him give a bad performance though even in not so great films stowe gives perhaps her best performance and proves that she possesses one of the most striking pair of eyes in hollywood in two words stunning convincing br br the set design perfectly matches the situation in function and mood the sound editing heightens to appropriate effect the total contrast conveyed through the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device and the welcome and only respite to the bulk of the story's necessary venue the script is tight and essential with engagingly dramatic yet realistic dialogue i e as it might be and ought to be perhaps the most amazing aspect to contend with is the fact that 1 this is the director's first time out and 2 he is the writer in one phrase a tour de force with three recommendations see it own a copy see it repeatedly to fathom all its secrets and grasp all it genius
<START> it's been awhile since i've seen cold mountain bit i do knew that i enjoyed it immensely though it does take place during the the last days of american civil war it's not really a war movie it's more of a romance drama and it works mainly because of the performances usually i don't like nicole kidman but i liked here i thought she was very convincing in her role i liked rene as well who i'm not usually a fan of jude law is good as usual the supporting cast there are some great supporting performances her too numerous too mention there's also some breathtaking scenery in the film and there are also a number of very nice musical pieces as well the story is sad and tinged with tragedy but it s a beautifully done well told story for me cold mountain is an 8 10
<START> for any fan of nickelodeon who used to watch the network in the 80s and 90s there was always something good on you had entertaining acts like you can't do that on television you had weird but good shows like pete pete you even had cartoons that taught morals like doug but just like disney nickelodeon has fallen down the tubes limiting their demographic to shallow preteens and giving us poor excuses to come up with new innovative shows as i tried watching zoey 101 i just shook my head in disgust br br the setting couldn't of been more fake than this one each character attends a boarding school called pacific coast academy boasting everything that a spoiled child wants a sushi bar everywhere flat screen tvs in every room cool dorms to hang out etc the kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there doesn't seem to be any real teachers it looks more like a place that you would spend on a nice summer vacation rather than to work and study while preparing for college br br the characters were also a factor that turned me off every episode consists of boy problems situations that they caused themselves and troubles that should be solved each character is a stereotype zoey jamie lynn seems perfect in anything she does and each of her friends ask her for help when they feel they are in grave danger only leading her to have no other side i've been through school and i can tell you nobody is like that chase is dumb logan plays the arrogant tough guy quinn plays a nerd who is highly unrealistic in what she does michael is an idiot lola is a clone of nicole dana is just well a tough person why not use some originality something that is unique for these characters and different from other personalities is being stereotypical the best the creators of this show can come up with instead these actors are dull personalities with the sense in that there is a lack of creativity involving their roles there is nothing here to be amazed or surprised at br br not only that but the show is clearly for the intent of aiming for kids of adolescence facing a stage in that they must evolve from being a child to being an adult through that period they must learn to study on their own make their own decisions and do what's right for them zoey 101 contains nothing of those values in this case we are supposed to believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed i'm sorry but that simply isn't true people can't expect things to be handed to them like the actors in this show are and just let those things sit there if i expect things in zoey 101 to happen in real life then i would be living in a fantasy world locked away in a dream house nothing in this show relates to those who face health and money issues neither does it relate to kids wanting to learn something meaningful br br so in conclusion zoey 101 is a show made by nickelodeon that only falls flat on it's face it displays a horrible message for kids and i highly think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them sure it doesn't have morbid violence but it teaches everything to make a kid act and look stupid a horrible show and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage nickelodeon has been making in recent years br br 1 out of 10
<START> kinda funny how comments for this film went consistently downhill now add mine i think the script could have been saved by better acting and the acting by a better script together it was difficult to watch and i don't flinch from such subject matter br br sigourney was the best part i thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this film offered to its genre but even she lagged can't blame her who knows what takes were left on the cutting room floor by the director and or editor the whole movie had an okay that's good enough let's move on feel to it when i know there was more to be mined from the actors and the script which did have some good lines and some interesting themes br br i don't think this counts as a spoiler but a perfect example is the scene where sigourney marches up to her son's supposed house and has this look on her face and i thought that's the face of someone who is overacting what it's like to see someone living in a mobile home and sure enough next shot meant to shock us i'm sure bully lives in a trailer as opposed to a nice house like hers br br as many other posters have pointed out there are so many better movies with similarly airy scripts about similarly messed up families that hit the notes better celebration probably being the ultimate example that i've seen
<START> i thought the movie was sub par the acting was good but not great the story was funny but did not come out that way the director dropped the ball on this movie it was not james jim or tea imho it was the music that killed it there is a scene where things go down hill and jonny cash music is playing man was that depressing not funny killed my mood after that the movie could not recover the deportation scene had potential funny situation good acting good set up i even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene the music kept me from being pulled in to the movie br br i say it had potential but was poorly done i would even say rushed into final production kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist the beginning the theater release was good i though so after watching it but the movie release exorcist dominion was a helluva lot better same story just different director same should be done here
<START> is a terrible horror technological thriller dee snider plays carleton a disgusting computer freak who prays on young girls through the chat rooms his ridiculous philosophies on pain and suffering are both misguided and totally unfounded there is no tie to reality with the ideas that are presented in this film it is more like dee snider sat down and tried to think up the weirdest stuff possible to impress horror fans and maybe some of his old fans but the end result is just awful br br unfortunately for me as a horror fan the cover of this movie looks very good and it immediately caught my interest which is the main reason that i was tricked into watching it i assure you that this is not a quality horror movie it is a disturbing yet boring attempt to suggest what might go on in the minds of people who treat themselves the way the carleton did in this film the sad part is that no one does this stuff to themselves marilyn freakin' manson doesn't even go that far and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film wasn't meant to poke fun at his type of music that would be a stab at snider himself it is more like dee snider was trying to raise himself from the career dead and present himself as a sick minded individual once more dee it seems that the time has come to let it all die
<START> this movie is well done it really attempts to show what the dinosaurs had to contend with in their daily lives the animation is very well done and the film makers have done a great job of giving scientific fact in such a way that it is entertaining this is a great movie
