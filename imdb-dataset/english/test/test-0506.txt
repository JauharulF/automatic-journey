<START> spoiler meets texas chainsaw massacre if you've seen those don't waste your time with this one typical slasher movie nothing new here except for the spoiler visions which just add fluff to an already weak plot i would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and it's either see this movie or stare at a bare wall for 1 5 hrs the only semi interesting part spoiler is when the chick starts drinking in the empty sheriff's office i say it's interesting because at least she made good use of that liquor instead of stereotypically using it to start a fire to kill the bad guy although she did go that route towards the end all in all lame bad and not worth effort
<START> in fact everyone responsible for this dreck ought to be whipped dragged and hung if this is what great eugene drama is like i never want to be victim to viewing it ever again there are so many things wrong w this feature where does one begin first elmer bernstein's bombastic score is present thru out the entire film even in the quiet scenes where background music subtracts from the character's motivations second these characters are not pleasant people and while some reviewers might enjoy that i personally disliked every scene in which ives ate up the scenery but that was the way his characters was written to be disliked w loren it just never is made clear whether she's good or bad Â and all her babbling about how she's going to change things back to the way they were before the baby arrives Â well i saw what was coming clearly perkins is miscast and then he plays the role like a warm up for norman bates which he played two years later even wanting to take blame for the murder at the end hokey third this film is a studio sound stage production and it suffers because of it the story would have benefited from location shooting to develop a sense of place regarding the farm which all the main leads are fighting over as it is filmed there's no sense of value to the property because the film has a studio sound stage feel to it that isn't convincing this is a really awful film
<START> i thought anywhere but here was a good movie it stars two wonderful actresses susan sarandon and portman which when i heard they were in a movie together i resist watching it overall it was a pretty enjoyable movie it had it's moments where i felt as if they tried to hard and there was also some really overdone and worn out material but there wasn't anything in the movie that i absolutely hated i even liked how they used the pop up performance of the uncredited birch and all the little happy sad moments are touching and effective if you want to watch this movie go ahead because even though i don't recommend it it's not something you should avoid and a 5 9 rating seems unfair in my opinion
<START> is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is japanese and that their arrogant star racer is german seem a little over the top maybe that is how it is on the international racing circuit but if all america had representing them are chumps like cody and his mechanic chris peter berg who must have been still learning how to act then i would be rooting for another country formula movies can be good but the characters have to be likeable and no one meets that criteria in this movie to put it succinctly a very bad movie
<START> i stumbled upon this movie by accident i mean how else could i find out it wasn't hyped at all by the studios nor did i even hear about it's release from my normally plugged in friends after throwing my money away on so many bad movies this year i wish i could've seen this one in theaters as opposed to dvd mike judge is the master of disguising deliciously intelligent humor in a low brow package just watch king of the hill for a while it's ostensibly redneck humor but it's a very subtle jab at rednecks while being very sympathetic at the same time i read the tagline for this film and immediately i ordered it off the internet i really don't understand where these negative reviews are coming from except maybe from carl's jr this movie is not only hilarious but it's balanced as well moments of levity are interspersed between hilarious sight gags and jabs at our current superstar corporate culture sure there is some fart humor but it's only there to laugh at derisively the premise is only semi plausible but since when did that even matter i don't see people heaping scorn upon futurama because the premise is very similar just watch this movie if you don't laugh then something is really wrong with you maybe your dad works for or something and he was really offended by the movie maybe you're an idiot probably the latter
<START> mr bean has shaped the face of british tv comedy he has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit a massive budget a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant and mr bean is one of those characters who you just can't forget some of these episodes had me in stitches yes they're not realistic at all and they're all pretty stupid but to be honest realism is one of the barriers bean has broken on its way to greatness rowan atkinson and co always manage to cook up interesting new ideas and hilarious new gags remember when mr bean drove his green mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof mr bean is one of those things that never gets weak the movie wasn't as good as this but bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor extras and little britain can be damned this is british comedy at its best and most original these escapades never get old 10 10
<START> the plot michael connors has done everything in films but direct and is looking for his 1st big chance he discovers molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star he signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way what follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy and oh yes there's romance and a little sadness too the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch the music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in 2008 it must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st not just a tribute to silent films later years would bring similar films such as singin' in the rain 1952 dick van dyke carl reiner's the comic 1969 what is special about this film though is recreating silent movies in 1939 we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era although some sound effects are included in glorious b w while the rest of the movie is in pristine color one of the greatest in the silent era buster keaton who at this point was on an uphill climb is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well but the real reason to watch the movie if your a motion picture history fan is that beyond everything else hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett's film legacy it doesn't take a genius to realize this movie is a positive reworking of mack sennett's and mabel life the character michael connors is mack sennett whose real name was michael and molly of course is mabel sennett had the pie the bathing beauties and keystone cops he worked with buster keaton ben turpin cameo roscoe fatty arbuckle body double and fell in love with his leading lady not only all that but sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well as most film viewers today prefer sound features those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture as mack sennett fell into that category it is fortunate that there is hollywood cavalcade sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies his career started in 1908 as an actor then writer director producer he semi retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit he had worked with the best such as charlie chaplin gloria swanson bing crosby w c fields keaton harry langdon arbuckle and even roy rogers in way up thar as film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career mack played it wise did only selective work for the next 25 years in 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work in the 1940's his presence was still felt e g here come the co eds 1945 where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in mack's wandering willies 1926 is done in 1947 the road to hollywood used some of sennett's crosby films 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film down memory lane in which he participated with his knack of always associating with the right people a guest role with the eternally popular lawrence welk his radio show came about later in the year 1950 brought a re release of his greatest triumph tillie's punctured romance 1914 with sound in 1952 he was honored on tv's this is your life then his autobiography the king of comedy 1954 which is a great companion piece to hollywood cavalcade was published 1955 brought a more concrete association with abbott costello as he had a cameo in a c meet the keystone kops finally in 1957 another tribute with the compilation film the golden age of comedy so when you watch hollywood cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer in the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table as we get to the silver haired mack he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say here i am when he rises to give a speech a short while later he is at his most subdued underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey i know my influence on comedy will never end but will people forget mack sennett the individual maybe this movie will help
<START> i'ts like going around in a museum you can appreciate the great talent of the main composer michael cimino this fabulous art of light vilmos zsigmond as i said i'ts like being in heaven discovering all the creation this man can applied to a single frame imagine when you can look at a moving picture of this artist i can say this film is one of the best
<START> this film is great well written and very entertaining david duchovny shows once again that he is much more than fox mulder and the performances by the old men are funny as can be old married folks like me will appreciate the connection between two hearts
<START> this has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films i have ever seen has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence sex and a minimalist retelling of the life of jesus christ the high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times but the use of texture combined with the extreme contrast create an incredible viewing experience this film is not for everyone i think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content which if extremely rough but does make a fairly important statement about creation god and humanity whether this film is a work of art or shock value trash is open to discussion
<START> first i am a teenager ok and i have to say this movie was pretty good i think any kid ten and under will like it but people my age an up might be a little um a well we'd describe the movie as lame but i liked it it may be that i still act like a kid or i visit a cattle farm every weekend but this movie was cute i did like how the actors were like kids not little blonde cutesy pies wearing three layers of clothes a trendy hat and about a thousand like most shows today to name a few drake josh lizzie mc guire well any kid show and the setting was perfect but there was a flaw the family was in debt right why in the world did their internal house look like something out of a western versace store that was one flaw br br the cameos are great there's about five hundred of them and the only explainable one is julia roberts being the main little girl's aunt how in the world did they get everyone else this movie seemed to be on a tight type budget br br i liked this movie it was a fun one to watch and i thought some parts were far fetched like a cow selling for 750 000 ha my butt a cow sells for that much but otherwise it was good i liked it and i could watch it again but i'd never buy it there's not even special features on the dvd what's up with that but do rent it especially if you have little kids running around the house
<START> this is an excruciatingly boring slow moving movie we can feel some sympathy for the socially and sexually inexperienced and awkward but the motivations of magda are pretty hard to see and the ending at least for me was inscrutable br br maybe it's about how we all need love but i'd get more out of a good busby berkeley br br i'm told that comments have to be at least ten lines so i'll add that in the background are some interesting shots of the relationship between polish citizens and government employees and institutions i wonder if it's meant to portray this before or after the fall of the communist government br br finally watch for the clever way the men from the gas company investigate whether or not there is a gas leak in stove
<START> first of all the genre of this movie isn't comedy it's more of a drama br br i had low expectations on the movie and still they didn't come up them as some of the other reviews point out there are some nice music in the movie but if you want to listen to good music i suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with bon jovi or crue it'll be more quality time br br last if you want to watch a good movie in this rock'n'roll genre i recommend almost famous
<START> this is an excellent movie there were several parts to the movie i liked this movie is very funny visit the ernest fun club web site at www com there are several movies such as the following ernest goes to camp ernest saves christmas ernest goes to jail ernest in the army ernest goes to school ernest rides again slam dunk ernest etc i highly recommend these for family movies all star jim varney again try visiting www com which is the best ernest movie in my opinion there are actually 2 ernest goes to camp and ernest goes to jail so if you have never seen ernest p its time to go and see him you will find him quite satisfactory no what i mean
<START> first time i ever felt i needed to write a review br br i have seen thousands of movies in my life and i like a wide range of movies i am reasonably opened minded and can easily say i enjoyed a movie while still saying yeah it was not good but i enjoyed it i can appreciate the mastery of great movies like the shaw shank redemption the godfather and american history x i can like good movies in a genre like horror or comedy even if the movie might not be that great i can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me bloodsport i also will try to rate movie fairly even if i did not like it city lights by charlie chapin was not a movie i enjoyed but i can appreciate the acting and story lines for the time br br i think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating should take a few ideas into account try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was do not let your personal bias affect the rating also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to rate br br this movie was the worst piece of trash i have ever seen 2 hours of my life where just stolen the acting was awful across the board the scenes where choppy at best however the real disgrace was the story the first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point a to b however after that it was a nightmare they kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained nothing really ever made sense was steward dead is he alive did he hit by lighting was it really lighting was it aliens is he an alien etc the ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions the only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theater br br 6 5 10 what is wrong with some of you i will admit that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this we did think what would make it better and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie what can i say misery loves company that is really the only reason i can see for a 6 5 rating br br do not waste your life
