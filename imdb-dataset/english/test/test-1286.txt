<START> what a waste of precious time my 5 year old daughter brought this home from my mother's house and we watched it as a family none of us liked it this wretched little film rife with glaring inconsistencies overt christian themes and horrible film quality is not worth watching even on a dare it felt a bit like a bad high school drama class attempt at film making how sad to see talented actors chris atkins gary busey and company flounder their way through this trite and insipid storyline the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the dog is cute the film can should have gone straight to the pound avoid this film your time is better spent watching paint dry
<START> i've got to say i'm a big fan of these 'last house on the left' rip offs even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me but one of these sorts of films that i didn't like much was aldo 'night train and unfortunately it would seem that trains and the last house on the left don't mix as terror express is another lacklustre rip off something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character and while terror express offers up three potential candidates not one of them steps up and becomes this villain leaving the lacking in the most important area it actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board this leads the audience to believe that there is more in store but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set from there the trio end up 'taking over' the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women br br it has to be said that there's a fair amount of sleaze in this film which will be pleasing to many viewers but there's hardly any blood director seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes and he may have gotten away with it too if he could film a brutal sex scene the idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time and despite one very tame sequence none of the sex is particularly interesting since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes this becomes a massive problem films like this are often lacking in style suspense and credibility but you know you're watching a bad one when it's boring you as you might expect none of the acting is up to anything and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish the direction is lacking in style and there's very little tension or suspense making it difficult to care what is going to happen overall this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film and i can't recommend it
<START> just got back from seeing black snake moan i had spent time reading reviews most seemed to focus on the obvious skinny white girl chained to a black man's radiator i hate when critics miss the point of a film now i suppose it helps that i live in memphis and have lived in mississippi a couple of times too it may also help that i am the former director of the delta blues museum in but i get this movie simple redemption tale is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story but i believe it is highly effect as a blues it would be my hope that people don't read all the hype and or various reviews and miss a really good movie get past the various things like skinny girls in white panties get past justin timberlake accept his character which he plays very well get past snakes on a plane and see how samuel l jackson is as he has transformed himself into a very believable mid south blues man if you know little about mid south culture a lot of what goes on may strike some as cartoonish but accept the fact that craig brewer knows how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this film not one to tell endings so go see this movie and yes i will agree with one thing the critics got right the music is wonderful
<START> pure crap decent cinematography i liked some of colors other than that this was one of the worst movies i ever saw boring lifeless not once did i find myself interested in any of the characters i kept waiting for a real plot to form and the movie to pick up the pace nothing ever happened i think they spent too much time working on hair and wardrobe that they forgot there was a movie being made at the time
<START> this was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long there was an aspect of film noir contained in this movie and i am glad that nolan picked to film it in black and white the plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged even the dialogue was good along with the acting it reminded me of what was to come in memento by not being in chronological order i liked how the main character tried to use what cobb taught him for example saying everyone has a box which he put his personal things into also on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because christopher nolan would later direct batman begins and the dark knight two other great movies there is a great twist in the end which i'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it even though i kind of figured what would happen when cobb gave the young man d credit card i also liked how the writer had a copy of the republic by plato one of my favorite philosophical books this is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it plus it only being an hour long there is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which i thought was pretty brilliant
<START> watching the first few moments you realize it's going to be a parody and certainly it is a parody but i'm not sure of what a fairy tale an opera a hollywoodian c movie if there was something like that and i can assure you it's not worth watching it's simply a pointless film cf a good parody is everything but pointless with pretentious shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters it's like a commedia or better it's like a botched commedia and the score sung in an intentionally incompetent way something greenaway will use much more efficiently it is painful to listen to unless one wears some sate of the art earplugs haha go for quality movies e g a how czar peter the great married off his moor 1976 and steer clear of this mistake
<START> john leguizamo must have been insane if he thinks this was a funny movie i laughed more times watching remains of the day pathetic plot unbearable acting horrible music michael is a maniac
<START> wow this movie was really bad you talk about formulaic typical movie plot watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall the transitions kept trying to be cool but failed the plot twist at the end where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected but doesn't make much sense until his monologue even then the amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either are all of those images necessary my last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie would the pd really send a lone officer into an warehouse subway tunnel or wherever to find a body when the location of the perp is unknown and why does the romance at the end just kind of happen all of a sudden it's like the writer was trying to fit in every hollywood cliche he could don't waste your time seeing this piece of something
<START> saw this on french tv today and was most disappointed the film starts off reasonably well but nothing is elucidated and at the end we are no farther forward than in the beginning as to seeing the husband for the murder of his wife this is just not plausible you need tangible proof to convict someone and a minimum of evidence in this case there is none at all so it just is not plausible remember the old adage innocent until proved guilty the fact that a woman has disappeared without trace is no proof that her husband killed her so i really don't know what kind of point this film was trying to make the outcome is totally illogical and incomprehensible no incriminating evidence is revealed to the spectator so quite frankly viewing it is a complete waste of time after all a film must be entertaining this is completely untrue in the case of this one and i suggest it be irrevocably consigned to the dustbin where it belongs
<START> i had high hopes going to see this as i always enjoy paul bettany's performances i thought he was very good as darwin and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work with br br darwin's book on the origin of species was one of the most ground breaking controversial and innovative publications ever yet you'd never think it based on this tedious movie it's like a two hour episode of a soap opera in a victorian setting there is virtually nothing about darwin's five year voyage on the to the galapagos islands for example surely of supreme significance to the story as it was from his investigations of the wildlife thereon that he began to form his theory of evolution br br this is just one long dreary domestic drama with darwin portrayed as a slightly loopy eccentric seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionally constipated wife jennifer connelly's portrayal of emma darwin is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical descriptions of the real emma there could have been an opportunity here to present the interpretation of life on earth from either emma or from the local priest as played by jeremy northam a blink and you'd miss it part which is a complete waste of a talented actor to act as a counterbalance to darwin's views but it wasn't taken up br br the story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about darwin's grief for his daughter annie and too much time was also wasted in darwin wondering whether or not to write his book eventually i was so bored it was difficult to care br br all in all this was a bit like making a movie about picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist
<START> the movie haggard is one of the funniest movies of all time it features the cast from the movies and also has a great soundtrack if you have seen any or viva la bam you will notice that everybody from those two are in it including parents and many other people br br the story is about ryan dunn's girlfriend jennifer cheating on him and him trying to get back at her he does this by having bam and falcone her house there are many different characters with many different stories br br there is great music on the soundtrack bands such as him her kill daniel iggy and the stooges pop and new order br br if you do not like viva la bam or the movies i doubt you will like this if you do like that stuff this movie is great
<START> i saw this on tcm recently and through the imdb i found that there were seven crime doctor movies with warner baxter as the psychiatrist detective baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd street a decade earlier not noir and a bit campy today the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural the plot black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the mr moto and charlie chan series there are subplots unexpected twists and appearances by a number of b movie we all should recognize immediately none ever made it to the a status it is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes br br i would love to see a boxed dvd series of these films
<START> spoilers sorry the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is 'gremlins' it's the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasn't too complicated as i hadn't seen the past two but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same br br critters starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boy's car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girl's dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i can't remember not a good thing but i'm sure they have to go back for something someone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he can't because they are endangered and so he sends them home br br the ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off it's a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if you're looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies sorry
<START> not a box office success no one really knows why it may have failed simply because of its title it looks as though you need a two word tough guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd die hard lethal weapon hard weapon die lethal etc talking about the long kiss goodnight will get you nowhere but for once renny harlin has made a good action movie a large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character samantha earns our affection and interest early on as she becomes charly again we're torn we certainly want charly to thwart the bad guys and all that but we don't want her to lose touch with samantha in order to do so even though we like charly too geena davis all of her considerable charm on both halves of the central character samuel l jackson plays second fiddle for a change it turns out he's good at it that was a compliment br br intelligent far superior to anything in the die hard series if i were more cynical i'd add it's not surprising that it didn't do well but i don't really feel that way it is surprising that it didn't do well
<START> i came across this movie on tv i hadn't heard of it before and almost changed the channel but it quickly hooked me br br the story of the struggle of the burmese people against a military dictatorship was provoking the level of brutality that some are willing to use to hold onto power is hard to believe it makes me thankful to live in a country where the government isn't likely to shoot people in the streets br br the story of laura bowman was a good thread to hold the story of political struggle together
