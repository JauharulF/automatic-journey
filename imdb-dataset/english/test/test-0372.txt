<START> what a terrible movie the acting in this film is about the quality of a high school play or a story driven pornography film this is not pornography in this film but there sure is a lot of gratuitous nudity this is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film one of the only things that saved it from receiving a rating on one star also there are a million cops that die in this film hardly offensive though since the violence is so unrealistic we can only laugh but breasts pop out and become exposed in the most surprising and hilarious times if you enjoy really really bad movies check this one out this is a bonnie and clyde type story where a mother and her two daughters are out for revenge this film also features a sex scene with two of the oldest people i have ever seen rolling around naked
<START> this movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public this movie dramatizes that point a conservative white collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street wise african americans by a no nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth but the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different the market place and the political system demands that he conform rendering him no different than his predecessors interesting off beat movie
<START> i own a vacation lake home not far from wi ten minutes from the gein property to be exact i've seen his land the cemetery where he is buried and where he did his digging and i've shopped at the hardware store that was formerly owned by the worden family while visiting relatives in california we decided to rent this movie it was disgusting the true story of ed gein is so disturbing and creepy why the creators of this piece of trash decided to make up their own story is beyond me the actor playing ed is a very large man ed was a very small meek and shy man that is part of what makes his story so frightening he did not have a helper to dig up the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with a little dirt in it you won't break much of a sweat digging a hole they didn't have to hire an actor with the physique of a wrestler just do your research and if the writing wasn't bad enough there are no mountains in wisconsin and i'm pretty certain that 911 was not available in 1957
<START> katharine hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking and is thought by the local folk to be a witch kate works overly hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick named trigger hicks but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario constantly smiling robert young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes first crush but alas he's married no amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula based on a play and brought to the screen by r k o with too broad a hillbilly flourish it is ungodly and just about unwatchable 1 2 from
<START> the movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the stooges the story is told from the point of view of moe howard and his relationships with his brothers shemp and jerome curly howard also the life long friendship with larry fine the movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the stooges multi decade career the casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble the actor who plays curly howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved stooge a must see for any fan of three stooges shorts
<START> following the whirlwind success of the wrestler see my review mickey rourke had this gem head straight to video every copy was rented for months and i even heard some good buzz around it so months later i caught it on a movie network and sat down to watch it first of all one of the locations in the film island is a place i used to visit on a regular basis as a child because we lived very very close to the reserve cool huh that's about where the coolness ends with this dud i mean the story is decent enough to warrant a four and even the direction is not bad but the performances are just awful and downright ridiculous with some truly wasted star power and mickey rourke playing a native canadian american hit man what in the lord's name were they thinking he doesn't even resemble native blood and his attempt at the generic native accent made him look even more ridiculous they could have went anywhere with this story they could have hired a native actor or changed rourke's character how about a white man raised by native parents instead they made killshot a complete and utter joke br br as you may have caught mickey rourke stars in killshot i use that term loosely i have never liked rourke much although his oscar winning performance was decent enough this shows and confirms my dislike for him he looks bored constantly bored and his lame attempt at portraying a native is bordering on insulting i would think he makes a decent cold blooded killer but then the story never explores that part of him which is totally backwards to the story diane lane although well respected in hollywood turns in another drab performance she has had her moments but overall she just usually doesn't take off in any one performance she looks like she is going to be great but then when she isn't its even more disappointing thomas jane plays her protective husband i've always felt jane deserves a bigger career than he has i think he's got action star in his blood all said and done his performance in killshot is actually not bad he doesn't take things too far and he's tough and almost heroic in a way him and lane manage to have decent chemistry but he doesn't get a lot in the way of his character i have absolutely no idea why rosario dawson a did this movie and b had a character at all her character is absolutely useless and had no point to the plot or story making any performance she would give equally as bad i have rarely seen a character who is supporting so incredibly useless the only redeeming character and performance in this film is that given by joseph gordon levitt as the deranged mini killer who wants to team up with rourke's hit man gordon levitt is over the top crazy and entertaining and his character is actually engaging if this film had been entirely about him it would have been a smash he literally saves this from utter crap his performance is almost worth watching this drivel for br br oscar nominated director whoa wait yes oscar nominated director john madden i think the football coach could have done a better job helms this mess i have actually never seen shakespeare in love but i remember the critical acclaim it received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was downright awful screenplay writer hossein has done nothing i recognize but apparently has been slated to write the next jack ryan movie and after this mess i can't even imagine why they'd want him i understand this is based on a novel and i really hope the novel is worlds above this mess a little bit of action and some sort of hokey attempt at an emotionally charged story of a hit man and his partner and the mess they get involved in unfortunately unless you're a huge rourke fan or really love joseph gordon levitt then there is no reason to put yourself through this pain i did it for you and i still feel the pain 4 10
<START> this film was incredible looked high budget but felt heartfelt and original like an indie the most amazing part of this film were the astonishing performances by david mark hildreth and paul anthony who plays the main role he carried this film with ease humor and charisma balanced with a huge depth br br the cinematography was really beautiful even though some of the subject was quite ugly it wasn't very realistic in that way but it didn't have to be to make a larger point it was really great seeing alan cumming in this too the script was tight and propelled very nicely with some of the best acting i've seen in a while br br go see this
<START> i find it hard to believe this could happen at all we do not know if justin and richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past the movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble so the first crime they commit is murder just to play and jostle with the cops how do they pick up any girl and just say you are it also richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle hmmm this whole concept is really hard to believe that said let's move on i found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then as for cassie who was a victim of carl hudson has a horrible time trying to survive the memory of having been stabbed 17 times by carl leaves her in an emotional mess sandra does a superb acting job she sure made me believe she was one angry cop as for solving the crime i thought it was great this movie kept me planted in my chair loved the acting of all but sam he had no get up and go the one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should i say the rape scene
<START> i too must apologize for a somewhat biased opinion of this endeavor as i contributed to the soundtrack still i received my copy sat back and enjoyed the rolling cast of characters who were perhaps more colorful than the characters they were creating in this tale of a film sequel shanghai for those who feel george bush is a credible texan one need look no further than this film to shatter the image that texas is full of truck driving one dimensional rednecks the cast contains some of the most intelligent peculiar and humorous folks you'll find anywhere as they spin their tales of agony bliss and disappointment in going for a great film sequel no budget guerilla style i e punk rock style as each person helps define br br this is a great documentary made with passion and guts and all the venom you'll need to break through to the other side of whatever industry b s and you're dealing with take note authors painters musicians and fellow filmmakers it hearkens back to the credibility of the first wave of american hardcore music when the term d i y was the standard a period where courage passion and commitment mattered way more than technique style or precious calculations not that there isn't plenty of technique or style to this the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing the editing cuts provide as much drama as the dialog therein br br the idea of creating a documentary out of the sad demise of the cast crew and director's initial intent is brilliant totally texas and absolutely punk rock in the truest sense of the term
<START> this movie is exactly the same as ridley scott's someone to watch over me which is a classic it stars tom berenger and mimi rogers and the bad guy from the fugitive it's a quality movie with good direction and great acting this movie is the polar opposite it's the same plot just minus any good acting and adding tv movie direction i do have to say i like the interaction between lowe and the woman she's hot and their romance is believable on many levels unfortunately that alone cannot save this carbon copy of the classic ridley scott film br br usually crappy tv movies have some redeeming quality that makes them watchable at the very least i think for me this film's redeeming value is that rob lowe and the lead female have chemistry that and i was able to watch and compare the plot to another quality film
<START> this movie was in one word terrible it was boring predictable and downright creepy i kept waiting for it to end and when it did i was horrified the ending left a bad taste in my mouth to say the least my advice to anyone interested in movies about budding female sexuality stay away from this movie movies like this give classics like lolita a bad name
<START> for a really wonderful movie you could also try seeing the movie about saint francis of good for any audience best thing i liked about this movie was the mexico landscape it gets the movie up to a 2 i was surprised that these actors didn't have terrible sunburn they were so were not desert dwellers and moses is said to have a speaking impediment but certainly not here even the miracle scenes were contrived un believable and what's the point if you can belief anything in a tv story talk about dumbing down i thought this hallmark made movie was pathetic i can see why others hate hollywood i don't just some of these corporate profit you don't have to be any kind of religious to benefit from jesus of nazareth but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored with nothing to do dumbed down religious and for a real movie experience try short cut to nirvana a very highly rated film
<START> wow i can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie br br although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt lillard granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in slc punk another great lillard film br br baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything which start to amount to craziness also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent d'onofrio a very under appreciated person in the film industry the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene br br it's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one they all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode matt shows his true prowess as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film br br the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies critic's probably won't like this movie but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway
<START> my wife and i watched this after it off of encore action this past week it has to be the worst horror flick either of us had ever seen predictable dialogue my wife and i were guessing the lines before they were spoken hokey special effects a screenplay that drifted all over the place i think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the various characters in the plot not to mention the gratuitous sex scene between two of the young heroines in the movie neither of which had any real purpose other than to bare certain parts of their anatomy for the cameras this movie should be categorized as comedy not horror as the villains of the movie spiders were stop motion animated and not believable in the least i can't say that i would have done a better job making a film myself but it was very amateurish and wasn't even a b movie somewhere closer to a d movie or f if that is possible i think even science fiction 3000 would have to pass on this one
<START> overall this is a pretty bad film but for 5 at it wasn't a total waste br br the whole scenario has to do with a guy who is with this lady infected with snakes supposedly from a magic curse the actors actresses aren't names that are big even though some look like from tv shows so i won't do my usual troy mcclure thing br br for awhile the film holds your interest as the couple hop a train and travel to l a to see a shaman to undo the curse there's a bit of other plots going on too like two ladies smuggling drugs br br but the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total let down as violent and gory as the whole film is the grand finale is just totally computer animated br br i saw the unrated version which had tons of language gore blood violence everything the bonus features were ok br br overall grade d
