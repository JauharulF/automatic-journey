<START> ninja iii is not quite as bad as enter the ninja the first part of this trilogy but it's still a very bad movie it will hardly please the fans of martial arts movies because there isn't enough action but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence as if the film wasn't already weak enough the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic the exorcist rip off the only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the dominated heroine she is a beautiful and athletic woman which the director doesn't forget to exploit in various sleazy ways she just happens to be an aerobics teacher i don't mind a little soft core exploitation but it must not pretend to be something else
<START> this splicing of the searchers is one of the weirdest films i've ever seen filmed by a briton in a strange unfamiliar mexico it's often said that the best films about america are made by foreigners who can approach the familiar with an outsider's eye but this crackpot film is something else though set ostensibly in post civil war america this isn't an america recognisable from myth cinema tv etc the film has an air of timeless fable about it while dealing specifically with western mythology br br director harvey uses the title horse as a focus for interconnecting stories all dealing with the traditional western clash of the primitive and civilisation the former seems to have the upper hand the vast scrub and desert of the film's landscape is unbroken ripe for allegories of the mind the only brief sites of civilisation are a stagecoach of missionaries and landowners and their hacienda from both of which derive behaviour that is anything but civilised br br the basic story intercuts three stories in one an aimless deserter pike having lost his trading partner steals a miraculous horse eagle's wing so called because of its grace and speed in the second an indian white bull owner of this horse a stagecoach and kidnaps one of its female occupants in the third the spanish men sent to find her ignore this quest in favour of a murderous plundering spree br br although a revisionist western the treatment of the indian is problematic unlike pike his character is never explained forever inscrutable denied a voice except for an excruciating snatch of song when he's not a strange other he's a symbol whose role isn't entirely worked out at one point a savage brute at another he epitomises nature and freedom br br but pike notes at the beginning that the film will attend to the period of before civilisation in many ways the film resembles 2001 a space odyssey especially its opening sequence part of the film's power lies in the connections made between the three disparate characters forcing us to view the mythic struggles and quests in a different light indian culture and catholicism is linked by superstition ritual greed and murder both pike and white bull are musical and alcoholic white bull is by both pike and the abductee as a unwittingly revealing the tactic of used by whites who infantilised the natives becoming themselves fathers br br unlike a traditional western concerned with making history civilisation and progress this film is a double detective story interrogating the past tracks remains br br what gives this film its remarkable uniqueness i think is despite maltin's racism its britishness the climactic stand off is more like an arthurian joust the film itself bravely eschews dialogue for the most part creating the kind of visual and aural tapestry malick missed in the thin red line and something few hollywood directors would have dared the existential doubling and quest motifs are more european myth than american resembling another british harvey keitel movie the br br most astonishing is the use of nature most westerns use landscape as an awe inspiring backdrop there is little sense of actually living in the west in many ways eagle's wing is like a powell and pressberger film with nature a powerful pantheistic character in its own right alive dangerous hostile beautiful there is a sublime scene reminiscent of a tale when jewellery left as a trap by white bull in the trees is suddenly blown in the wind there is a haunting tingling magical thrilling effect more reminiscent of the arabian nights than a horse opera heartstopping
<START> once i knew that donald sutherland jack shaw henry fields was appearing in this film it instantly told me this was going to be a good picture to view most of sutherland's pictures are full of action and suspense and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and kind in this picture jack shaw did his very best to be a good guy and a bad guy while he was training a naval office to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become a different person over night there is plenty of car chase scenes and plenty of stunt men situations which i would not want to perform this naval officer lived in a quite community with his wife and was a father but you would never realize that fact until the film reveals his horrible background secrets which he had to keep from his family and friends good spy film and great acting by all the actors
<START> due to rather dubious plate japan starts to slip under the sea initial predictions say it'll take about 40 years before the country is submerged but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than 1 year the government think he's a crackpot but evidence soon starts bearing his theory out br br this big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of hollywood films of the late 90's i assume having seen none of them with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human well japanese spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice and proving the power of love or something like that i e it's as naive in its psychology as it's geology we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned and the other half would just panic and be useless br br the film does have some very nice special effects but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent hollywood production would be it is at least as nationalistic humourless and lacking in self awareness as that hollywood film would be though and probably has even worse acting it does have the hot evil chick from battle royale as one of the leads but she's not even slightly evil and is therefore much less hot br br the film is much too long at 132 minutes and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking i certainly didn't care in the slightest whether japan sank or not by the half way point and well before the end i was trying to think of ways to the process should i ever find myself in that situation for real br br but it does have nice special effects and kou shibasaki is still pretty hot so i give it 3 10
<START> i'll give it a two because it has a lot of music otherwise it would be a one br br i saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first road picture i've seen i was expecting waaaaay better robert says this is the best of the road movies if that's true i needn't bother to see the others the best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half but that's balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie br br i didn't like the movie neither hope nor crosby came across all that well their characters weren't very charming the movie was not funny at all most of the dialog was just lame filler there wasn't much action there wasn't much spectacle br br the movie wasn't what i expected i was expecting more road but there isn't much they quickly make it to the palace and then most of the movie takes place there until the end i was also expecting a lot more of the famous road style of breaking the fourth wall wherein the characters talk directly to the audience or comment on the plot there was only about 4 instances of that one of those is an example of the non funny humor of this script br br hope the plot up to now to crosby crosby i know all that hope yeah but the people that came in half way through the picture don't crosby you mean they missed my song br br those are two weak punchlines but at least they are actually jokes much of the rest of the script doesn't even have any jokes an example is br br crosby remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning indirectly calling hope a rat br br that's not funny at all it barely even qualifies as a joke but that's the kind of non joke dialog that carries most of the movie many of the scenes don't even come that close to a joke just using generic uninteresting dialog like br br crosby hey ya' take me for you think that you can just throw me to the dogs hope well why not you did it to me didn't you crosby yeah but that's because i was lookin' out for us you're not lookin' out for nobody hope oh yeah well then why did i pay the check br br the above is just from my memory it's not exact but it illustrates to you what i mean br br and so on just generic dialog with no jokes at all br br my grade a waste of time
<START> mr bean starring the legendary rowan atkinson was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s and i probably first saw it when i was around ten shortly after it ended so i was seeing reruns i certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time and didn't see too many episodes i didn't really get into the show until my late teens just a few years ago which was when i finally watched every episode unlike before it made me laugh many times and since then that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes br br mr bean is a mysterious self centred antisocial extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his teddy he is pretty much isolated from society and life is not easy for him as he constantly struggles with very simple things this is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge and has the mind of a child he finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes and comes up with very bizarre ways to try and solve the problems he faces not only does he often cause trouble for himself but sometimes for other people as well which he often doesn't tend to realize in other words mr bean is a walking disaster br br the humour in this show is very visual and there is very little dialogue the gags are almost always sight gags which is mostly what the show is about while there may be an occasional lacklustre gag i would say the vast majority of them are funny often hilarious there are so many highlights while mr bean is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made it's still great for many of those who like visual humour and due to the very limited dialogue you don't even have to speak fluent english to enjoy the show which is why it has received such a world wide reputation the show ran for a few years but the episodes were made very gradually so only fourteen were made in total nonetheless it is a classic series and deserves its wide appeal
<START> the movie in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy movies ever made in bollywood perhaps even hollywood br br when the movie released i was a 8 year old and i heard it was a flop but i never understood till now why was it a flop but let me tell you one thing this movie would have more money by selling home cassettes and dvds and by showing in tv movie channels than any hit movie in theaters this movie has been shown countless times in movie channels and i think even now the public love and the tv producers keep repeating the movie again and again i personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 100 times and i still love it br br the performance by both aamir khan as amar and salman khan as prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of aamir khan as a street smart guy his dialogs in the movie are hilarious the story is simple and heres how it goes br br amar and prem are poor lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and father is a barber then they both get a news that a millionaire 's daughter from london is coming to india to look for a suitable match both amar and prem think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich therefore they both head out to woo raveena tandon the millionaires daughter in their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry raveena the comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing and then there is uncle millionaire's look alike brother who wants to take revenge from father since he is broke and dad is a millionaire his plans include kidnapping raveena to blackmail dad for which he hires 2 butlers br br but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie watch the movie to know then there is shakti kapoor as crime master gogo who is also incredibly funny br br the thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sorts aamir khan uses his brilliantly and salman goes like and for gogo there is jab raat ko hain to ma hain ki to gogo aa each and every scene is so funny br br i especially liked the one in which aamir khan and salman goto get raveena from and they both go in a luna having money in a bag that scene is so funny br br i recommend anyone who understands hindi or urdu to watch this movie this is one movie that i would recommend having a dvd and you will never regret
<START> what is often neglected about harold lloyd is that he was an actor unlike chaplin and keaton lloyd didn't have the vaudeville music hall background and he wasn't a natural comedian he came to hollywood to act and he discovered he had a knack for acting funny first in shorts then in features he made a name for himself as lonesome luke a chaplin knock off with the glasses character that made him the all american boy rather than a grotesque lloyd found his stride and his movies became some of the best produced during the silent era br br he developed a reputation as a daredevil in some shorts and retained this in some of his best movies safety last for heaven's sake girl shy he was more popular than either chaplin or keaton during the twenties and he became very rich before the advent of sound br br the first sound movies were often disasters to get the most out of their sound too much dialog was used in many movies br br lloyd's acting skills were after two decades geared for silents he didn't have a bad voice its high pitch suited his glasses character and his sound films weren't the unqualified disasters of legend yet silent movies had been raised to a high art especially lloyd's which did not stint on budget and were extremely well crafted with the introduction of talkies movies had to learn to walk again and they made some missteps br br though he tried to move with the times and embraced sound lloyd's best bits from his early overly talky talkies were still visual such as the scene in movie crazy where he appears to be riding in a swank car but actually hitched a ride on his bicycle br br trying to recapture the daredevil antics that made him famous as he did in feet first was misstep in safety last his best movie and the one that deservedly or not shoved lloyd in the box as a daredevil comic he played a determined young man climbing to the top safety last had a natural structure that ascended to his character's scaling the side of the building he was obviously afraid but his fear added to the humor in feet first he arrived in a precarious building scaling position by accident his frantic cries for help detracted from the humor his character was pathetic and cringing aspiration to save his neck possibly an accurate statement of the 1930s but not amusing br br harold lloyd was not mired in the past like some wacky norma desmond he embraced sound and tried to take his movies in different directions growing and changing with the industry when feet first failed he left the daredevil business and made a satire on the talking movie industry movie crazy just as he had to flounder through many movies as lonesome luke before carving his place in movie history with the glasses character he had tried several directions in sound movies before hitting his stride in sound which he did with the br br in the he plays a missionary's son reared in china who unwittingly gets elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests when he finds out the truth he sets himself the task of cleaning up the town only in his early forties lloyd could still act the brash young man br br yet the was another box office failure and lloyd made only three more movies including the milky way of his chief competitors chaplin still had silent movies in him and keaton was hopelessly mismanaged the and the milky way suggest lloyd might have mastered sound comedy if he had been a little younger or if audiences had given him the benefit of the doubt after his early sound br br though the movie has been unfairly maligned about the way lloyd's character cleaned up the town it suits him from his days in shorts lloyd wanted to scare his audience and the climax of the achieved it yet again in a surprising way until the trick is revealed it appears gruesome and then come the laughs br br viewed as a product of its time the is charming and funny a very well written sound comedy well acted by lloyd directed by sam taylor its curious blend of drama and sly humor make it look almost like a frank capra or preston sturges comedy
<START> just as in columbo we see the fatality occur right at the beginning what follows is an escalating web of lies sex blackmail and murder the investigating officer adam arkin is even somewhat of a fumbler not unlike columbo it is william h macy as the movie critic suspect who carries the film constantly twisting and turning the plot sends macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his perfect crime william h macy fans will enjoy a slight case of murder as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities add some well timed comedy and this is very similar to a fine episode of columbo highly recommended merk
<START> the film shows relations of the dying mother and the son who is very attached to her and definitely loves her what does it show it shows their living in very poor conditions it shows how tenderly they walk really he is bringing her but what do we see further after their promenade he walks alone at the same places where they walked together it is not possible a person who love and care about another dying one would do everything to make the life of this one better he would not have a free minute to ponder to be alone with oneself and if he finds a few minutes a month for that he would run away from the places where he has usually to be another thing the author devoted this film to tarkovsky we see he learned many tarkovsky's visual effects but in sokurov's film they are only effects they do not support any senses or mood someone has compared this film with mirror there is nothing common except these visual effects mirror is a great film and this one is just poor imitation
<START> wtf do any of his books movies end in a happy ending the notebook was good but sheesh enough with the depressing endings already i'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life understandable but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days don't we already know what really happens in real life can't we for one moment an hour and a half live vicariously through a movie that ends on a happy note that gives us hope for our own futures br br yeah wah i know but for real i think we need to preface movies that end like this one with a warning beware no happy ending
<START> walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years the script for james walker's sidekick is about as pathetically written of a part as wesley crusher on star trek tng and is played with about as much conviction br br on this show people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life everyone is polarized everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly that's not how life works that's not how people are this show doesn't take place in this reality br br the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her with walker everyone on the show including the bad guys act like he's the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of and time itself bends to his whim the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley crusher for the serious parts and the scriptwriter for bob saget's funniest home videos for the humor parts got together and wrote all the scripts for this show br br this show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil it's for the elderly it's for wishful thinkers it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion it's for people whose drug of choice is their television br br i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years br br i used to like chuck norris but this show has forever tainted him in my mind i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show
<START> i actually belong to the demographic zoey 101 specifically is trying to target so i can see that as much as it tries to be relatable to people my age the premise is simply too ludicrous for an average person to relate to the show revolves around the wealthiest boarding school in existence and the lovely incredibly tan attractive gang of one sided characters who inhabit it as is the tradition amongst kids networks the cast is an array of skinny white kids with the token black guy of course br br the story lines all revolve around zoey and her gang of friends stumbling upon or creating some sort of minor dilemma such as not wanting to attend gym class resulting in zoey devising a scheme to save the day for all her friends there is generally a b line revolving around either a one sided guest character or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations such as having a hive of wasps in a dorm room and no one noticing these plots often play off stereotypes such as any character who pulls good grades in math must by default completely lack social skills the majority of episodes have the continuous and overused will they won't they chase zoey dynamic br br the characters unfortunately are all incredibly one sided there is zoey the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything chase the constantly lovesick still but rather endearing best friend michael the token black guy kudos to christopher massey for managing some genuinely funny one liners lola the theater chick meaning she dies her hair and 75 of her dialogue is about her dreams of stardom despite the fact that she never does anything in the actual theater logan the womanizing narcissist dustin the spazzy little brother and quinn the science geek the few words i spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely br br zoey 101 does manage to be entertaining at times but the serious flaws in the system of values it promotes are a major turnoff zoey who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi feminist crusader and who is on the surface portrayed as flawless still manages major character flaws for example when lola was first introduced she was believed to be a goth girl zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm room for being freaky br br as for the acting it is quite clear that jamie lynn spears landed this role because of her name not because of talent although she has definitely improved as time goes by it is clear she is not a born actress which greatly affects the quality of the show as most of the plot lines revolve around her character the supporting cast is surprisingly good especially considering the material they have to work with they deliver quite a few good one liners for comic relief if the plot hasn't yet ventured into obscurity br br all in all zoey 101 is a flawed view at high school life and anyone past their limited too years shouldn't expect much from it
<START> definition of documentary a work such as a film or television program presenting political social or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration the key word here is informative i love they might be giants and barely learned a thing about them br br the interviews with all the celebrities were pretty much worthless i don't care what sarah vowel thinks of anybody and syd straw was downright irritating and is listening to people recite lyrics like they were supposed to be funny interesting it was neither i think that was the problem the movie spends time discussing love for coffee so what millions of people love coffee was the presentation of the material funny no there were hints that both men are married yet it was never discussed and what about the solo material they did what motivated them to do it these type of questions are not addressed nor answered br br i could go on and on with the negatives i did find the segment on dial a song very interesting if you want to learn about they might be giants just buy a few cd's and listen seriously this movie is a gigantic disappointment i can't believe so many folks gave it a 10 incredible
<START> i rented this movie primarily because it had meg ryan in it and i was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one not only is she not on screen much but nothing her character does is essential to the plot her character could be written out of the story without changing it much
