<START> this is another sci fi channel original movie staring rhys davies where its hard to decide whats worse the acting or the writing directing producing john helms all three basic story obsessed captures monster smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins clichÃ©d sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter handsome hero and mad scientist captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship since of course wouldn't believe a monster story no dramatic helicopter drop of the navy seals here budget only allowed for entire force force of eight seals to arrive in a fishing boat and ride a ships wench aboard puleeze also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer i also loved when the seal commander looking thru standard binoculars from ten miles away was able to see three people jump of the ship if the sci fi channel is going to continue original movies i hope they realize there audience is not kindergarten level and purchase better scripts and directors if this were direct to video you would find it in the 99 cent bin
<START> this is another one of hitchcock's highest rated movies and rightfully so this is a tale of two men who meet on a train and playfully exchange murder fantasies one of them robert walker takes it seriously and this leads guy haines farley granger to trouble with the law another fast moving hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes the carousel scene and the tennis match are worthy of mentioning not a movie to be missed it is a shame that no one will re release this on dvd with loads of extras just a cheap warner brothers dvd is all thats out there now
<START> i couldn't' agree more than with the comment left by and how this film is a masterpiece i have never seen a film that had my adrenalin flowing that this film did and that mostly happened when bronson comes running out a fire escape with like an m 60 and plows down like 20 dude from a gang it's genius quite possibly the best action movie ever made no exaggeration either it really could be the best action movie ever made from the start one should know that you re in for something sweet when the police let bronson go and tell him tell him to clean up the slums once again genius and once again bronson is a bad ass paul is just as cool maybe even cooler than john mcclain or the terminator he's just simply a bad ass and what else is great is the fact that he's a nice guy and buys a kid some ice cream and helps out an old couple all before he kills some scum bag genius highly recommended if you hate this movie you're crazy
<START> what offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of this film does not contain one innovating element if by you refer to pathetic action scenes overacting gluttony in violence blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief then is something swedish film can do without br br how rÃ¶se and karlsson can agree to 'act' in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me and how eva rÃ¶se after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast tv promoting it just disappoints me br br this film doesn't contain a story the script is illogical stiff and last but not least just plain bad these two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy fantasy containing violence comic strips and trivialized psychological portraits i wouldn't be surprised if the scene of dd masturbating in the kitchen over a micro wave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directors br br i wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy
<START> i have seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show and most of them i was forced to watch and i did not like the episodes i saw what happened to dan schneider after giving us such awesome shows like drake and josh why did he decide to create a stupid show like this my problem is not just with dan it is also with the guys who nominated this show for an emmy were they drunk that day or what's the problem drake and josh didn't get nominated for an emmy but it's way better than zoey 101 the makers of this show should be ashamed for the existence of this show let's just hope the pregnancy of you know who will affect the show or better yet it'll cause it to get canceled
<START> oh yes hollywood does remember how to use the good old formula and when lightning hits it's a rather wonderful feeling rarely hollywood creates a masterpiece because lately there seems to be more concern with hurrying up and getting the most rewards in a hurried manner or there is the matter of too many cooks in the mix usually good screenplays are the result of a talented writer who is in full control of his her property understand his material and is a good writer then there is a little important part often neglected by the marketing geniuses that so often lack creativity and vision a good actor br br a good actor can make the difference between a mediocre half cooked try and a fully realized film that might not be an important and relevant movie but one that contributes to its genre and might eventually become a classic of its type we get very few romantic comedies and we are people who are starved for them buried in the sexy humor of sex in the city is the romantic yet stormy relationship of big and carrie and people flocked to mia because it had some romance skillfully played by streep and it could have a silly musical but it did touch us because it was played with intensity and conviction nights offers us more of it with the amazing talents of a woman who does magnificent work in romantic films ms diane lane ever since her days as a child actor we could appreciate how her talent combined with her appreciative soul allowed us to see into the hearts of the story's protagonists a few years back she teamed up with mr gere giving us a tormented romantic and sexy performance as the wife who is not too sure of her consequences in unfaithful work that should have garnered her at least an academy award she is back doing more formidable work in this romantic gem as a woman who has given up on her romantic prospects and suddenly she realizes there might be another chance around the corner br br ms lane makes this film pulsate with intelligence and passion her facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions her character undergoes we can read frustrations yearnings desperation anger hope loss and a range that is way out reach for a lot of the marketable types that hollywood constantly push down our throats here is a mature performer who has the gift to project real emotions and allows us to connect with the material in such a way that we are moved as we become part of the experience br br ms lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through transformations from the first scenes of the film until the very end her discoveries become ours as we celebrate with her the power of hope and love she is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a person in love much like a teenager does and yet she never lets you think of her character as silly or irresponsible her eyes are expressive gems that can move even the cynical in the audience she is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look in her the classic feel of those grand movies of yesterday are back her work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of hepburn davis garson women who played everyday types and made them memorable because they created complete characters br br we admire those superb actresses who recreate real life legends and are rewarded for it half their work is done by the mystique of the figures they impersonate however as much as anyone might make you think it is the roles such as lane's in this movie that are a more impressive achievement because they are created from scratch given a personal imprint and are able achieve heights without any previous theatrical material support such as plays and the background of a famous legend whose life is paid tribute on the silver screen lane's character is one woman whose experiences could be any of us she represents our dreams and emotions with much quality class and just the right amount of sentiment it is quite a remarkable achievement and we should be grateful that we are still able to find such a remarkable performance nowadays br br there are a few adjectives i could use to pay tribute to her work but i can only say that in my humble opinion every single frame of her work in this film is testament to one of the greatest performances ever put on celluloid by a living performer thank you ms lane
<START> i don't really know where to start here just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the acting to the props to the story that it makes you angry this is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and that is saying a lot because i have seen some bad ones when i saw this movie i knew it was a blade knock off but i thought that hey its got kung fu and vampires a combination that i thought could not fail that is until i popped this into my dvd player how ron hall managed to mess up something as cool as vampires and martial arts is beyond me first the acting i didn't expect to much here to begin with because its an action movie and a b one at that but the acting here is so bad i couldn't help but be bothered by it expressions and vocal tones were way out of place there was absolutely no emotion in almost the entire film and when there was it was so laughable it thought i was watching mad tv for example that girly man scream derek lets out when he has to kill master kao who should have never been born in the first place all in all i've seen better acting at elementary school plays then there is the action not even sub par compared to the things that have been done in action cinema as of late but still the action was not a total let down as ron hall does seem to posses some martial arts skills but even the skill he does have is over shadowed by the stupid things he does for instance the part of the movie where he starts spinning and then the camera changes i almost ripped a pillow in half and the fight scene where his prison buddy fights off vampires by swinging his arms at them wow or how about the part in the jail where derek all of a sudden knows magic and can preform chants that make tap water holy water and as far as the props go the guns look like walmart toys the teeth were stolen from halloween costumes and words cant describe how bad the cg graphics are i could go on for hours about all the things wrong with this movie and trust me this is just the tip of the iceberg its only getting a 2 because it made me laugh even though i was laughing at how badly the movie was done a laugh is a laugh i would say steer clear of vampire assassin unless you want to laugh at a horrible movie or are planning on getting tortured for long periods of time and want to practice
<START> three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men the three businessmen take revenge which escalates to a murder after another supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people br br the plot has too many holes the details were ignored in order to move the story forward the acting was uneven the color balance was awful even though i watched this movie in dvd the small budget and tight schedule were apparent the whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight and the ending was just unbelievable
<START> as a note i'd like to say that i saw this movie at my annual church camp where the entire youth group laughed at it i bought it when i saw it on a shelf one year later if only for the humor i derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie br br lay it down falls short of many movie fans' expectations on several different planes most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting regardless of the nice cars in the film or the truth in christ's sacrifice for you as a movie and witnessing tool lay it down hardly delivers br br most good opinions of the movies are supported by christians agreeing with the message while it's easy for a christian to agree with the points delivered the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a clichÃ© the fighting scene between ben and his brother is horribly dubbed and there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles br br i encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's commentary on it really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was the director's views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a movie needs he shows a pedantic understanding of as well as some points of religious conflict most of the editing he admits was rushed but satisfactory he thought the over used transitions and themes to be effective and was completely happy with the acting br br he also inserted motifs that he was rather proud of all read most of the names are significant ben destin been destined gus gospel man nicky d nicodemus the car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without christ when ben leaves on pete's motorcycle he crosses his crutches to form a cross br br i'm not making any of those up he throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like blow their brains out with guns and how god is in control when your born and when your die yes that was not a typo he really says that br br i have little forgiveness reserved for this movie the cool cars and good message don't do jack to make this movie good however the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1 100th of the fast and the furious's and the time limit was unforgiving with that in mind i give it a score of 2 10 instead of the 1 10 i so dearly think it deserves
<START> i'd chose either over this film this film has been in my must see list for a while because people talked about it being disturbing and also the vhs box contains lots and lots of quotes from people saying how amazing it is or how as close as you can get to texas chainsaw massacre and lines like that but sorry folks i was disappointed big time the idea is interesting but the script is so underdeveloped that each character becomes a mistaken creation of evolution and people do indeed to the dumbest films in the film br br that in turn takes away any credibility that the plot may have otherwise had i couldn't believe how unnecessarily loooooong some where is he let's find him sequences were a few gory moments to please the gore fan but they are so few that by the time we get to them there's no point if luther's a geek then the filmmakers must really be down on the food chain
<START> perhaps the director was trying for another pirate good garland and kelly musical but this lame musical epoch falls flat sinatra and kathryn voices do not blend well and their chemistry together lacks spark the premise of sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late father is okay but he seems awkward in the role what's amazing and wonderful here is how sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again when grayson sings the same songs it's hard to believe she's not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting she has her big moment with love is where you find it which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities the photography is and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets co stars mildred natwick and j carroll nash put lots of energy into making the impossible work aside from sinatra's singing there is a strange menage a dance with ricardo montalban cyd charisse and ann miller it's fascinating and weird montalban and charisse were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity
<START> craig brewer grew up in tennessee it is evident in his movie forget the black guy on white girl action it happens but it isn't samuel l jackson on christina ricci more importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this tennessee town how they deal with divorce abandonment sexual abuse and psychological disorders while shrinks make millions in the cities of the north midwest and west coast the town minister who also grapples with his own problems becomes the counselor and mediator it is a interesting concept and one that may not settle well with everyone br br brewer shows us the region he grew up in yes it is still tainted with racial problems though worse problems exist in many metropolitan cities this is in the subtext and not the main plot of the story people live a more simple lifestyle yet life is still complex and excruciating br br jackson and ricci do a fantastic job in this film jackson the aging former blues guitarist who eeks out a living on his small farm his wife of 12 years leaves him for his brother so he spirals into depression meanwhile ricci and justin timberlake have a last wild sexually charged night before he ships off to the army ricci suffers from a childhood of sexual abuse though that isn't revealed until later her torment can only be quenched by sexual forays with various boys black and white in the town br br when ricci is beat up and left for dead on the road near jacksons farm he finds her and nurses her back to health he believes it is divine intervention that this half naked white girl is left in his care he clutches his bible and prays for guidance he refuses her sexual advances and instead treats her with dignity respect and care something few men in her life have ever done br br she in time sees jackson as a man of honor and morals yet he also carries his own pain he plays his guitar and sings to her yes it's the blues and damn good too with the minister counseling her she slowly understands how to deal with her childhood sexual abuse jackson through ricci's transformation realizes he must let his own pain heal br br justin timberlake comes back discharged due to anxiety problems as he searches for ricci who has been living with jackson during her recovery he finds out she has been promiscuous and unfaithful to him br br he finds her and jackson at a bar where jackson has decided as part of his healing process to come out retirement and play the blues again timberlake follows them home and confronts jackson and ricci br br you will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story should you decide to see this film remember to look at it from the aspect of a foreign or independent movie it is a slice of life from a particular region of america that few of us get to see it is interesting and revealing it also shows us that regardless of the color of our skin we all have similar problems that can be fixed with similar solutions
<START> what i've seen of wolfgang petersen's films has been pretty good he knows how to direct action create suspense and get you interested eastwood tends to be great sometimes excellent this goes for both his acting and his directing they both hand in solid work here the concept isn't bad and the cat and mouse game works well malkovich performs rather well and his and eastwood's playing off each other adds to the film i suppose this won't introduce anything new really but it never really claims to nor needs to it's two great actors each playing a basic type of role that they have proved at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well and with a magnificent director at the helm really it's entertaining well done and it just plain delivers editing and cinematography are good acting and character writing is as well the film manages to be suspenseful and intense and if you let yourself you will probably be entertained and engaged even if there are superior films out there the pacing is pretty much spot on i recommend this to any fan of the principal actors the director and or this type of film 7 10
<START> graduation day was released in may 1981 during the height of the slasher film craze earlier that year fans had been subjected to flicks like my bloody valentine just before dawn friday the 13th part 2 and the burning and theaters still were expecting flicks such as halloween ii the prowler and happy birthday to me i have seen all of these films and out of all the popular 1981 slashers graduation day is by far the worst br br what graduation day amounts to is an exercise in poor low budget film making with bad acting bad writing pointless characters pointless scenes unneeded nudity cheesy dialogue and an experiment in editing that didn't work so well and who could forget the classic 80's disco music that plays throughout the film the opening scene's music is only rivaled by the music that plays during a chase scene however when renting a movie like this a person should be aware that those details will be in this film so why isn't graduation day considered a classic like halloween friday the 13th a nightmare on elm street my bloody valentine the burning or prom night why do fans still seek those films but disregard this without care br br where slasher films need to succeed above all other areas is in the pacing there is nothing worse than a slow moving slasher and graduation day moves pretty slow the most aggravating part is that there are plenty of opportunities to speed things up there are numerous pointless characters who are introduced and who are never allowed the chance to be a suspect in the murders or be a victim there's a sleazy teacher a stressed principal a cunning secretary a dopey school security guard a clueless detective an alcoholic step father a mindless grandmother and a mom to an earlier victim still grieving all of these characters could have a motive to killing or a reason to getting killed but they are all wasted the worst part is that the story still focuses on them and at times designates entire scenes just to flesh out their character but for what br br what does amaze me about graduation day and its small fanbase is that people aren't more amazed by the death scenes fans go wild for death scenes like the raft massacre in the burning the washing machine death in my bloody valentine the kabob death in happy birthday to me the upside down death in friday the 13th part 3 and hot tub death in halloween ii and even the car hood death in madman but where is the respect for some truly unique even though cheesy deaths in graduation day one victim gets impaled right through the jugular with a fencing sword while another gets that sword thrown at them like a javelin the best death includes spikes under a landing mat why aren't these deaths famous among the genre like the deaths in more popular slasher films br br graduation day tries hard to be a great and unique film but there is just an element of logic and pacing missing that really ruins the whole experience its not the worst of its kind try checking out don't go in the woods alone and there is a bit of suspense plus it delivers just what fans are looking for blood gore nudity sex and nostalgia but graduation day will not be remembered as one of the all time greatest slasher films ever made it's not a question of budget almost all slashers have a low budget however it is a question of ideas creativity and craftsmanship that's all any type of movie making is br br recommended for hardcore slasher fans general horror fans might get a little bored and people who don't have much interest in horror at all should steer clear it's not the worst slasher film ever made but its a long way from being the best
<START> this straight to video cheap flick is based on a true story i don't doubt it doesn't mean it's particularly interesting unless you are one of the main characters who actually lived though this experience a young woman named angela buys a great big old country home really really cheap well as we all know from watching horror movies when you buy a big house cheap it usually means it's haunted in some way shape or form in fact the second the house is being handed over to angela the wise guy kid who lived in the house up to now takes a moment to introduce angela to one of the ghosts nice guy huh angela gets in touch with a psychic and a paranormal expert and tells them that her house is haunted and invites them to come over and see the ghosts for themselves they come to a party and sure enough there are ghosts walking around sitting on the couch hanging in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom a few friends sleep over the night of the party see the ghosts and vow never to come back in the house again check out the girl who i'm so scared i'm so scared totally emotionless if she was so scared why didn't she get up turn the knob and leave the ghosts don't really do anything menacing aside from show up and there is no or aura about them they look just like regular people they steal celery from the kitchen move chairs around a la poltergeist and one bisexual female ghost seduces angela who get this doesn't seem to mind this scene plays like the kind of soft core porn you see on the spice channel ummm not that i'd know hahaha the actresses aren't your typical porn stars though they should hit the beach and the gym more when not making love to the dead she gets mad at them and stands alone in a room screaming why won't you leave this is my house get out they don't leave i couldn't help but think of all the times i've heard psychic sylvia brown on tv saying that if you have a ghost in your house you should calmly rationalize with the ghost and say look you're dead it's time to cross over to the other side in other words get out according to sylvia brown as long as your not hostile and nasty about it they'll leave this movie looks like it cost about 50 to make it has a really cheap feel and bad acting i could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder
