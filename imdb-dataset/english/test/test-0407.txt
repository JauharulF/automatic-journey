<START> the acting is awkward and creepy and not in a good way at all the writing the dialogue and the chemistry between the actors is horrible nothing makes sense and every close up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long making it seem like a mexican soap opera everything about the writing is unrealistic and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script am i the only one who sees this to use the word cheesy to describe this canadian disaster would be the understatement of the century did the director even watch the final cut before it was put on the air
<START> this movie accurately portrays the struggle life was for the typical east german watched by the secret police friends and coworkers most easterners simply existed br br the and the were two families that decided they weren't going to take it anymore br br despite the extreme danger involved in escaping to the west they feel the rewards far outweighed the risks john hurt and beau bridges portraying the respective family heads hit upon the idea of flying over east germany's heavily fortified border br br there are tense moments as they gather and jimmy rig the necessary materials for the flight they work their day jobs and construct the balloon at night right under the noses of the authorities one of whom is neighbor klaus br br the first attempt involving only the ends in failure when the balloon crashes just a few yards from the border the crashed balloon is discovered by border guards and an relentless search begins for the conspirators who are determined to try again with sales of materials being closely monitored peter and still manage to procure bits and pieces of cloth with which to construct a second balloon for their nail biting escape to freedom the film also features a heartwarming and effective soundtrack by the late jerry goldsmith
<START> good cinematography good acting good direction cannot justify a story that is not and cannot be acceptable to any society amitabh has often used the media to make this junk sell able by saying that if such an incident happens then what i would like to ask him if such a thing happens for your own child or your grandchild say girl child then what will you do i think every parents will have to take special care before interacting with any 60 year old neighbor if you have one jia with you such films should be banned and discouraged otherwise you inspire more more cases such acts are villainous and villains in films are punished that should be the moral of the story and not glorify their act or them
<START> at a time when hollywood thinks that louder faster and bloodier are better manna from heaven is comedic and touching look at something we've all thought about what would i do if a load of money fell from the sky br br interestingly it took the characters many years to realize that the money hadn't made a single difference in their lives they all become what they were destined to be unfortunately in most cases what they became was unhappy in spite of their good fortune all those years ago br br while manna offers the familiar hollywood storyline of good vs evil or in the case generosity vs greed what sets this film apart is that good wins out by converting evil not by crushing it br br i think the important message of this film is that you can change the world even if you do it one person at a time
<START> i totally agree with the other poster nemesis is one of the best of the christie adaptations with a superlative plot and cast br br the scene involving liz fraser as the mother of the murder victim is a study in acting at the finest level this underrated woman was a fave in brit films in the 1960s who never got a mainstream break in us films check her out as julie andrews's friend in the 1964 the americanization of emily br br all of the in this prod have a chance to shine with and without the peerless ms who was never for an emmy for her marple work shame on them and dig the lesbian cid agents
<START> this movie is very good in term of acting and plot the events and the setting i e how chris gets the job chris's work environment the face to face between the two sides etc thereof on the other hand are found to be less than realistic
<START> this movie makes glitter look like schindler's list tarantino and the weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product green lighting a p o s like this regardless of the friendships involved is just bad business larry bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs writer director producer actor bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs a vanity project gone south hell ride allows usually good actors to chew the scenery at least when the camera isn't centered on bishop's feeble attempts to steal every scene he's in which is virtually every scene my final three words on hell ride are stink stank stunk
<START> it's difficult to make it through this movie without choking on your own vomit to be honest the shoddy animation doesn't help as it makes this look like a decades old video you'd find in 99p bin still it's better than the abysmal screenplay which spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras like belle's present day problems stuff about scrooge's dad and plenty of charmless around with choke two anthropomorphic mice these bizarre additions eat up screen time at the expense of elements you'd think would be quite important like dickens's dialogue and key chunks of his plot the movie up the game of twenty questions for example and at times fails to put scenes in the right order absolutely hopeless
<START> all i can say is this movie is made for the lifetime channel on tv which means no solid characters no particular style weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no breasts and because boy that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze wouldn't it but the heavily simulated sex well that's ok br br when watching these films i have to ask myself when will these types of tv channels and their advertisers ever grow up i think these companies are actually way behind the times they really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change the whole point of many american tv channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line i guess it works for them or at least it has not sure about the future though br br don't bore yourself to death like i did seek out some real tv movies on hbo showtime ifc starz etc any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show
<START> i love the thackeray novel on which this film is based and while this modern version of becky sharp's story is a b film the casting of loy in her first top billed role is rather fascinating br br before loy became mgm's reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles she was an actress vanity fair was loy's follow up film to emma in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper marie dressler br br loy's becky is much nastier than miriam hopkins' version 3 years later in becky sharp loy's becky is very much a pre code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways it's the type of character that jean harlow or clara bow could easily have played but becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set that's what makes her fallen character so tragic br br in counterpoint to loy's grasping becky is the goody goody amelia barbara kent who is just not an interesting character mary forbes is good as mrs most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah conway as walter byron as osborne anthony bushell as others are nearly dickensian is their quirkiness billy bevan as joseph lionel belmore as crawley montagu love as the marquis irene as polly the maid as the housekeeper br br loy is front and center throughout while the ending is rather shocking she has several excellent scenes such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet the more loy's becky descends morally the more beautiful she gets until she is finally caught bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by loy in a film that should be seen
<START> i've heard about this documentary for so long i knew i needed to take the time to watch it as a documentary it's very well done in that it takes a neutral observant view of their experience there are no voice overs or interviewing it is honest it is true it is also humbling two comments really stayed with me after the film was done one was how the boys are told to not to become like the american boys who wear the baggy pants and how in africa there is time but no money but in america there is money but no time the biggest impact was how the boys for education and how one of the boys totally relocated himself so he could go to school i watched this film with a high school sophomore who said it upset him to see how the boys were brought to their new life without any real orientation to america he also said he knew so many american teens who simply cannot appreciate their lives are in america i would agree with him on both accounts a strong film that will leave a person thinking about many things
<START> not a balanced point of view the director shouldn't express her opinion as truth the movie has some criticism of but it always gives him and his family the last words so few critics of were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views but that is not the case br br the movie barely shows one of the massacres that is accused of and it gives him credit for the the murdering of the insurgents that took the japanese embassy it is well documented that the cia did the planning there is even pictures of a well known cia strategist on the site published by magazine and other newspapers br br the fact that such well known information was not used by the director gives us a few possible conclusions the director is pro and purposely and falsely chooses to give the credit to him the director does not want viewers to note that the cia and worked together or it was just out of ignorance since the director is not peruvian and was not present in peru at the time the events occurred br br the explanation provided by other commentators that is still fairly popular in peru does not excuse the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations br br also the statistics provided in the movie for the actual support of were the highest i have ever heard of most statistics by major poll agencies are much lower br br another point to mention is that the intelligence that was key in the capture of the leader of and discover the secret network was done by a police force led by vidal and he had complete autonomy from and br br the first government of did experience an improvement in overall economic trends but this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts that were not beneficial for the country in the long term also the gap between rich an poor continued to increase during regime in his second term the economy was suffering and there was nothing else to privatize and by the end of second term the economy was about to collapse br br in terms of investments in infrastructure of regime they fallow the paternalistic pattern they were created to raise support for but were not meant to last long these structures needed continued maintenance but did not provide political power for the civilians in order to demand further investment in fact regime was able to destroy most forms of political organizing such as unions and grass roots groups and the increase in informal unorganized labor was immense br br finally the director chose to spend most of the movie talking to instead of citing the cases of massive corruption in favour of the media business owners the military etc that were so wide spread it was impossible that was not aware of it
<START> people are stupid you shouldn't cheer when paris gets killed in the head with a pipe it is plain rude what did paris do to you what if that was you you wouldn't want people cheering for your death anyway it was really gory which i liked and it was cool when finger gets cut off it was weird with that twist that they didn't have 2 sons they had tree and all it makes way for a house of wax 2 or something paris was great acting in the chase scene elisha and chad chemistry is great they deserve an oscar my friends and i were cracking up when that guy said that's hot when paris and the guy from cousin making out lol k bye
<START> need i say more the reason the good australian version of and kim was as mentioned good was because of it's hilariously funny originality the reason this new american version is so terrible is because a lot of it is taken straight from the original not to mention the unfaithfulness to the characters is meant to be a kim is meant to be fat kel or phil as they have dubbed him is meant to be pathetic brett or craig is meant to be a loser not a person who acts like he's on heroin and finishes every sentence with thank god szubanski didn't sell her rights to sharon she'd probably end up being a tall thin blonde who kim likes br br and kim are mother and daughter they are not meant to look 2 years apart and they are not meant to giggle like school girls this show is a disgrace to even share the same title as the australian version america get your own television shows
<START> honestly i was a big fan on 'stay alive' trailer when it got released even some months before i kept on telling my friend how this movie has a great story plot and perhaps a good one anyway this movie is somewhat below my expectations br br the plot has a great potential but how the story unfolds along with the acting directing and bad cgi this film is a disaster the ghost doesn't make any sense and including the killings its all just too hurried creating a sense of in the audience's mind br br this film could be scary for some audiences but fear in a sense of shock due to the sound effect etc rather than enduring fear due to certain valid factors in the movie br br you should re consider watching this movie
