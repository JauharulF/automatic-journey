<START> i looked forward to watching this film since i loved the david lynch version in my first attempt at watching it i fell asleep nothing was happening the next night i tried to watch the rest and again it was putting me to sleep nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive the only time it got a bit more exciting was when i tried it on fast forward the dvd came with a second disk which contained bonus material needless to say i had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of dune 2000 here are the low points the acting was bad the plot moved in slow motion the sets were and looked cheap the direction was pathetic and the cgi visual effects childish br br if you want to watch dune save your money or rent the 1984 version
<START> some movies want to make us think some want to excite us some want to us but sometimes a movie wants only to make us laugh and in out certainly succeeds in this department br br indiana high school teacher howard brackett kevin kline is going to be married to fellow teacher emily montgomery joan cusack in three days but the whole town is more excited about the oscar nomination of former resident cameron drake matt dillon but when cameron wins an oscar for playing a gay soldier he thanks his gay teacher howard for inspiration what follows is howard denying it in an hilarious set of mishaps in a truly screwball fashion br br kevin kline is great exuding gay stereotypes joan cusack really has a knack for screwball antics debbie reynolds is utterly hilarious as howard's mother and bob newhart is also a hoot as the homophobic principal br br gay screenwriter paul really achieves a delicate balance here he knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that's mostly tolerable to conservative and yet mostly inoffensive to the gay audience it's not exactly progressive but it's funny and inoffensive and definitely a step up from the previous year's the birdcage
<START> i just watched the dvd version of born bad and found it to be tense gritty and near the end too graphic for the faint of heart justin walker clueless and corey feldman turn in superior performances for a low budget film this picture delivers the depth of character and clever dialogue are two things not usually seen in a roger corman picture check it out on dvd
<START> i'm sorry but star wars episode 1 did not do any justice to natalie portman's talent and undeniable cuteness she was entirely underused as queen amidala and when she was used her makeup was frighteningly terrible for anywhere but here she sheds her god awful makeup and she acts normally and not only can she act good she looks good doing it i'm a bit older than she she's only 18 and i have little or no chance of meeting her but hey a guy is allowed to dream right br br even though susan sarandon does take a good turn in this movie the film belongs entirely to portman i've been a watcher of portman's since beautiful girls where she was younger but just as cute there's big things for her in the future i can see it
<START> this in my opinion is a very poor movie that advertises arnold schwarzenegger as starring despite him being the co star only to sell more copies obviously taking influence from the similarly themed movies this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually fails to entertain at all br br bridgette neilsen stars as sonja a beautiful woman who has been given unbelievable strength by a ghostly figure after her village was pillaged her family killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of queen bergman is a tyrant queen who wants control over the barbaric world and seeks out a talisman protected by sonja's sister to do it after discovering what has happened sonja sets out for revenge and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of schwarzenegger the master of the talisman sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or not br br the first major problem with this movie is the beginning the events leading up to the point where sonja receives her powers could have easily made a good ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film however the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a quick one minute previously ' segment from a television show had they actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the filler later on they may have been able to start redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didn't i wonder why director richard fleischer has only currently directed two movies since red sonja br br this film also features some of the most annoying characters in history like ernie reyes jr who is a stupid character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably he was quite obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the overall absurdity of the film anyway this was another costly mistake for br br for all it's faults there were some good fight scenes involving both neilsen and arnie which are worth noting but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey the acting is about as good as it gets for movies of this quality and even arnie didn't seem too bothered about his performance i don't recommend this film at all to me it's a waste of an hour and a half my rating for Â 3 10
<START> i like this movie and have watched my copy twice since acquiring it a few weeks ago but you have to view it in the right context br br i haven't checked on the dates but i bet this movie came out after and certainly around the same time as the collier and walt disney of the vision of spaceflight being promoted by w von braun this is reflected in the attempt to seem factually correct and scientific however whilst certain ideas are put across step boosters for example roughly correctly other things are hilariously wrong br br for example we are told that a rocket ascends to an altitude and then turns ninety degrees to enter space like reaching the top of a flight of stairs and turning onto the landing then we are told that by turning in the direction of the earths rotation the total velocity of the ship is increased accordingly br br this is an hilarious misunderstanding of what really happens most space launch centres are located as near the equator as possible where the earth and anything on its surface is rotating at roughly a thousand miles per hour including any rocket departing to space in an eastward direction the same as the rotation of the planet of course if the ship turned to travel once in space its speed in relation to the surface of the earth would be greater but it would add nothing to the actual velocity of the vehicle in this movie as air speed br br similarly we are told that the travellers only feel free fall or when they reach some thousands of miles from the earth outside of the planets gravitational field again comically incorrect most crewed spacecraft travel no higher than a couple of hundred miles up but as long as they and their contents including crew are travelling at an adequate velocity that their momentum in an outward direction balances the pull of gravity they will orbit in free fall of course travel far enough from earth and even a slow object will coast outside the earths gravity well but in order to leave earth orbit outwards towards the moon for example requires the attainment of escape velocity around twenty one thousand miles per hour so the vehicle will have already attained orbital velocity and by definition br br but the movie has vastly more hilarious stuff than this someone decided it would be more fun if they missed the moon due to a technical problem fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find they had accidentally gone to mars the captain then to the effect that this must have been divine intervention at which point any pretence to being scientific is torn into little pieces like confetti and thrown upon the wind amid the merry dance of an increasingly barmy plot br br the strength of a film like this in fact is in illustrating how far we've come not least in attitudes to women the patronising drivel heaped upon the female crew member is both hilarious and also shocking to think that such attitudes were so recently normal br br as i said at the start i find this film very entertaining as a late night lights out romp through the romance of travel in outer space from the perspective of the days before it had actually happened an antidote to the cold routine of spaceflight as it has now become in the twenty first century br br i won't reveal the ending it is both brave and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character
<START> the second mr eko episode has somewhat less interesting flashbacks than the first the 23rd psalm but in just about every other department it is one of the best episodes of season 2 advancing the series' mythology background as well as the characters a new dharma initiative station the pearl is discovered by locke and eko and the orientation film that they find and watch inside completes locke's transformation from a believer orientation after the end of the film we're gonna have to watch this again to a doubter s o s did you push that button henry i need to know to a non believer after the end of the film do you want to watch this again no i've seen enough terry performance is powerful as usual every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button meanwhile eko takes his place as the man who becomes sure that he was brought on the island as part of his true destiny which is to continue pushing the button other high points of are a startling unique dream sequence where person a has the dream as being person b this is the kind of bold idea that the current season of lost could use much more of and the haunting scene of libby's last word before her death and the way jack and hurley cannot possibly know its true meaning 1 2 out of 4
<START> the chilling directed by and jack a is one of the worst zombie flicks i have ever seen why linda blair the exorcist witchery appeared in this stinker is beyond me the plot is really dumb the frozen bodies at a lab are revived after lightening strikes and turned into cannibalistic zombies the characters are completely one dimensional and stupid the zombies look horrible and there is no gore avoid this cheap piece of trash like the plague my rating 1 out of 10
<START> i couldn't help but relish the entire premise of cat in the brain because it dutifully explains a director's steadily going mad seeing people murdered from past movies he has made even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past director fulci playing himself is directing ghosts of and can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder he seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps he's responsible br br this is obviously a film playfully poking fun at fulci's image while exploring the themes of how such a profession which produces so much death and destruction rarely untamed could mold and shape a legacy the film features pretty much a wrap around story surrounding non stop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail this has a shower murder hitchcock never could direct or probably want to the film's savagery compliments the mental state of fulci's fulci i know during the running time reality and cinematic fiction have fused and fulci can find no escape the ending explaining the old clichÃ© it's only a movie couldn't work any better than it does here fulci's boat says perversion excellent touch and he sails off i can only wish this was his final film because that's a perfect close if there ever was one david l thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill his adulterous wife kennedy is a cop fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiend br br the ultra violence in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest a scythe a chainsaw and hatchet the most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieces how a gardener's chainsaw work on a log fits beautifully in one nightmarish hallucination sequence the most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated the opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away feasting on fulci's brain is a howler the scenes which are spliced within the film featuring a horrified fulci looking on are obvious but i couldn't help but enjoy this anyway
<START> i remember years ago bbc1 used to show this movie in a very cut form i tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again the film although slow and slightly odd the mountain men look very strange the atmosphere was eerily effective it's one of my favorite slasher films and i have no idea where an uncut version can be found currently deleted everywhere except the usa where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation it's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen wrong turn the recent stan winston produced movie owes a great deal to just before dawn one of the better 80's slasher films and deserves to be seen by a wider audience
<START> warning contains spoilers br br i felt no sympathy for any of the characters incl the main one who gets over the death of his girl friend v quickly but it's ok as he shacks up with an ex prostitute from the casino he works at the main character is portrayed as this wonderful intelligent writer who gets drawn into a web of deception all the while there is running his monologue of the book he is writing i can't say i would buy the book a much better premise perhaps would have been if the voice over which annoyingly cuts in to narrate any bit of the film that you might not have understood via his book would've had 52 different to represent each card in the deck but i digress in the end there was a twist whereby the main character has been setup by someone close to him but as i disliked his character so much by this point i found it impossible to like anyone in this film the characters are all one dimensional zombies that i really didn't care and was glad the film was over br br plus points the english actress from er doing a dodgy south african accent minus points an irritating film
<START> this is one of the most underrated movies of the 1990s if you allow yourself to identify with the patricia arquette character you will find it to be a very moving story of a woman regaining a sense of purpose to her life and finding a new will to live br br arquette's performance is brave because it is purposefully wooden it's a way of defining her character's spiritual death her complete lack of a desire to be alive she moves through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she can't see the point of living what is moving is how in the course of the story she is reawakened by the burmese landscape by the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes and by the primal choices she is forced to confront br br boorman supports this visually and hans zimmer supports it with one of his most gorgeous haunting scores with an often static camera and with a propensity to shoot through glass windows windshields etc we are on the outside looking in just like arquette until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life br br i recommend the 1954 movie the purple plain as well it's a similar story in a similar setting and makes for a fascinating comparison
<START> this is probably the worst film i have ever seen it makes plan 9 from outer space look wonderful the acting is wooden the plot silly and the sfx non existent the only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film the scenery is sometimes quite pretty assuming you like trees if that helps any
<START> it seems there are two kinds of people in the world those who think that five characters is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already predicted the lame twist at the end which apparently in their small minds is the only reason the twilight zone exists to come up with twists br br there are plenty of lame episodes in the series and i'm not one to rate all tz episodes ten but this one is certainly one of those that merit such a rating it is claustrophobic and colorful the suspense is built up and we cannot wait for the reveal of the secret at the end but whatever that secret is what these people are it doesn't really matter most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that it would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers in a strange place really are
<START> as noted in other comments here the camera work is laughably bad i am tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7 year old but that would be mean to 7 year olds br br okay but what about the subject i was looking for some insight into the state of the wine industry worldwide you know what the film is about is a very narrow view of one intrigue in that world the struggle between and the french and italian that they would like to buy there is no enlightening narration that would put the whole deal into context so we are left with the selective process of the director and the interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama there's no shortage of despicable characters or even despicable dogs in sight there is a shortage of evenhandedness however br br is the director a marxist i wondered as i tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the camera dipped swerved zoomed in a chaotic flourish small grower in france good huge grower in usa very very bad forget about the hundreds of small throughout north america australia and south america there is a dead horse to beat here for over two hours br br to learn about the intrigue more you are better off reading about it elsewhere and you will be able to sample your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing so br br i suggest a new award at cannes for best america bashing diatribe
