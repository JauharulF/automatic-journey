<START> stone has tried another type of movie any given sunday falls short of a the above average the last boy scout and the below average against all odds stone can be fantastic see the doors natural born killers or platoon but he can also repeat himself see nixon or born on the fourth of july his real brilliance is realized in the michael caine perfection the hand
<START> the film moves along quite well but the acting direction and editing leave a lot to be desired the characters are mostly lifted from other films and the vinnie jones lookalike is straight out of gone in 50 seconds the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out that leaves everyone dead you should never really know whether to laugh or just sit there in shock this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been one just become increasingly critical a pity cos it was a brave attempt and although clint eastwood is famous for saying that'll be ok for a scene he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood here a bit more imagination with the camera and and a bit more coaching and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference
<START> i tried to give this show a chance but it really doesn't sit well with me although the performances are good the writing isn't the two oldest step siblings derek and casey are equally annoying i get the impression that we're supposed to side with casey given that she's the protagonist but i don't find her at all likable the parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless the three younger children are the most watchable things on the show lizzie and edwin are sweet the way they team up and marti is adorable the plot lines are a bit far fetched and the whole premise is mostly hard to swallow blended families are common yes but this family isn't really trying all that hard to blend on the whole i think it grades thumbs down
<START> halloween 666 1995 the producer's cut review br br halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to part five if you thought the last chapter was dark this one will really blow your mind a mysterious man in black has raided the haddonfield police department freeing micheal myers in the process poor jamie lloyd was abducted by strange cultists what they want with her who knows but let's just say her long suffering will end soon doctor loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop michael myers from killing any more innocents good luck a friend of loomis doctor wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor another old face from part one guest stars as well br br this dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing for some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasn't worth the average horror film watcher's time so they decide to dumb it down then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office no matter what they did to the film they made it worse they should have left well enough alone hey the film company knows better than the filmmakers now don't they br br producer's cut highly recommended br br released version not recommended
<START> a very surprisingly underrated movie very realistic and authentic with great dialogue being italian i can definitely relate to the situations and phrases used i thought joe cortese was great as a crazy mob cowboy type and pesci and vincent were great also i liked the actor who played the boss he was very authentic i think the director ralph devito was on his way to great things but was cut down too early maybe because he knew too much i thought it was great it deserved more airplay and recognition it was a sleeper movie great very good it really had good authenticity it was well done
<START> i could watch this movie all day i love it probably my all time favorite movies but by the way there are a few parts with bad language not too bad but it's not exactly g rated great movie i recommend it to everybody any way it's making me type 10 lines of text so i am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment okay still typing this is getting annoying ugh i still have four more to go anyway watch this movie even if you have already seen it i don't care has it been 10 lines yet nope only 2 more lines left i don't even know why it wants me to do this i think i am done wait a minute i'm not done sorry people i know it's torture listening to me well i suppose that you don't have to read this comment but you should because i wrote it i am probably done now finally bye
<START> not too good a movie sure it contains action but the effects aren't all that good for a '08 movie gunshot effects are downright horrible acting is meh br br it is nothing like far cry other than names and the very basics of the story genetically enhanced super soldiers going amok the super soldiers are very different the mercenaries are different the setting are completely different tropical island in the pacific in the game island in northern ish america in the movie br br i loved playing far cry i loved the story and setting i hated the movie
<START> br br the author tried to make a kevin style movie but he definitely failed the result is a boring film that cannot sustain itself using only the dialogues fortunately i had my remote control and could see the tape using the speed
<START> the apartment complex is a campy comedy full of characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student lowe who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery um if you can call it that this low cal watch contains no suspense no thrills no drama no action precious few funny moments a dash of nudity and almost no romance the apartment complex is passable forgettable junk food for only the most needy couch potatoes
<START> wow the storyline to this was just incredibly stupid i realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre but still even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense br br water has become incredibly rare substance br br well that's strange considering that oxygen or hydrogen is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe and pretty easy to make together hydrogen and oxygen atoms and voilÃ  water br br instead of water the rarity of crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after water as a plot device was just dumb dumb dumb br br the comedy seemed labored and contrived and forced the comedy in the tv series red dwarf was labored and contrived and forced but it was actually amusing here instead i felt like saying ha ha that was just so funny i forgot to laugh br br sigh all that money put into sets costumes actors what a waste br br rather than just whimper and whine and complain at it's lameness my recommendations to make it better 1 use a believable plot device 2 get rid of the comedy none of the actors were really any good at it the movie would work better as a serious action adventure br br the obvious intention of the writers was to do a spoofy comedy but they didn't quite pull it off it's not likely i'll ever watch this again it's too much a total hack job
<START> i saw this film at the 3rd adelaide international film festival at the palace cinemas and was totally switched onto it in the opening five minutes thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in australian films that seem to revolve around a race b gender and c class in favour of er dare i say jolly good cinema the producer a shy slightly eccentric chap called alex introduced his film made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood apparently he's spent much of the last year traveling the world with the film mostly in europe the world the film creates is both brilliant and arty not least because of strange and disconcerting editing style the gothic characters and the surreal sense of time and place that draws viewers into its nightmarish realm br br the producer returned for the q a after wards someone asked him what his inspiration was he replied south australia hear hear another asked him what a in the life of alex' entailed he replied that he drives an old ute that he has breakfast at the same table at the same restaurant that he's jolly well eaten at for the past 8 years and that he plays piano which helps him to think he doesn't drink booze and plays cricket once a week then the q and a session ended abruptly because of the next film screening so my thoughts are that for the next festival they need to extend the after film sessions
<START> cult starts 20 years ago on the mountain range southern china' as a guy called owen robert finds an ancient amulet said to have magical powers cut to california where has set up a cult the members are about to sacrifice themselves when one of them foils his evil scheme jump forward to the present day as five college students mindy rachel miner cassandra taryn manning bailey glenn dunk alex joel morgan victoria are researching the events of twenty years ago that have become know as the massacre' for a school project unfortunately morgan decides to kill herself which unleashes the evil spirit of owen for reasons that are rather tenuous he sets about completing what he started all those years ago by claiming souls so he can finally inherit the magical powers of the amulet for his own evil use br br edited co produced directed by joe knee this is not a good film that's being kind to it the script by benjamin oren which seems to take itself very seriously is a dour supernatural tale about a cult leader who comes back from the dead to finish what he started a few years prior as you would expect the character's involved now have links to what happened all those years ago it's as dull as it sounds the character's are bland forgettable the dialogue just as much so there's no proper horror or exploitation in it it's slow going at times it's predictable it's clichÃ©d it goes completely off the rails at the end doesn't make much sense when you think about it the story never grips or engages you it's never exciting or particularly interesting i'd struggle to even call it average there is very little here by which i could recommend cult don't bother with this one br br director knee does alright but the film has that bland shot on video made for tv look about it it's utterly forgettable flat stuff throughout there's no scares there's no atmosphere it lacks any tension there is no gore either sure there's a fair amount of blood splatter but no proper actual special make up effect gore scenes br br with a supposed budget of about 950 000 cult looks cheap although it's not as badly made as some low budget horror films i've seen recently the acting isn't even worth mentioning br br cult is a poor film that didn't do anything for me i'd struggle to call this average there are much better horror films out there
<START> this is not what one would term a happy tale the titled leading character edmund purdom as the egyptian does not get the gal although he does evidently get the 'last' word the otherwise principal tragic figure michael wilding as the politically myopic pharaoh ends up tragically and the wrong guy Â even if it is victor mature winds up winning all the marbles peter ustinov possibly had gotten the best part kafka and arguably may have stolen some if not most of the movie except for top billed jean simmons as the somewhat brighter barmaid merit whom just possibly has more on the ball Â intellectually and spiritually than all of the rest of them put together br br the brooding and pessimistic the physician purdom is portrayed as a dark cynical tortured soul whom spends the entire plot Â his lifetime seeking the meaning of 'life ' btw and to paraphrase john lennon 'life' is what happens while you're making other plans pardon the lack of philosophical depth in the prior comment but eventually the plot unfolds to reveal just that br br and speaking philosophically as if things aren't morose and negative enough john carradine the un named grave robber pops up in a cameo role in the middle of the flick espousing that 'life' basically is meaningless and is only worth living as a poor alternative to the eventual ultimate disappointment br br so here we are over 200 words in and i haven't really had a kind word so why the heck did i rate it so high well there is a lot of tragedy and bunch of moral worth in it there's ethical contrasts true friendships true unrequited almost love and despite limitations of 50s production capabilities it is very well sound staged pleasing both the eye and ear and very well evenly paced the acting is for the most part uniformly very good Â given it's a 50s costume drama and the interactions are believable right down to the characters' fatal flaws which abound and in that doing justice to the best of greek tragedy br br there is some redemption does discover and embrace his son Â played by tommy whom despite ustinov's best efforts really needed lassie to pull it off a couple of other souls get their just desserts Â the 'foreign' bella Â apparently in egypt on a carnal exploitation work study visa whom earlier cruelly even mercilessly spurned and the princess gene tierney as pharoah sister whom knew a deep dark secret about ancestry and then tried to use it to set him against his friend her brother the pharaoh Â nice people huh br br performance is actually something to behold he carries off the dirge well enough that somewhere before the end of the pix you want to smack him across the puss grab him by the lapels and say look dummy pull yourself together the glass ain't half empty it's half full Âand then finding that you're personally disappointed in truly best friend victor mature as top soldier for himself having that flaw in his character that prevents him succeeding at doing something positive br br i wonder if the secret to the whole movie is that it very quickly achieves and then sustains the necessary suspension of disbelief and early on gets you understanding and worrying about the characters caring to the point that you really feel sorry for them and their missed chances at happiness a happiness that otherwise wasn't all that far from their grasp br br understand why this one isn't already out on dvd and hope that gets corrected soon
<START> not bad but could be loads better also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama you've got sandra bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others you've got her placed with a new partner there's a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway and there's so many lines in the film it makes you want to scream br br however if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath it's gripping and the subplots worked for me well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase
<START> stars danny devito billy crystal anne ramsey kim kate mulgrew oprah winfrey and rob reiner br br after college class teacher larry crystal wants his ex wife dead and owen devito wants his momma ramsey dead when larry brings up that he wants his wife dead owen knows what he must do for him in order for a favor in return for larry to kill his mother devito is absolutely hilarious in this as the brain dead wannabe writer that has daydreams of poisoning his mom and sticking scissors through her head he has a child like role that makes him seem more of a confused man than a killer was actually nominated for an academy award for this because of her wonderful performance as mean old mrs lift along with having comedy the film also has heart one scene between devito and crystal starts off seemingly as a joke but goes deeper actually making me slightly sad danny devito directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in to his direction for any fan of comedies i recommend this br br my rating b plus 84 mins pg 13 for language sexuality and violence
