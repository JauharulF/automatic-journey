<START> simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah am also giving these 4 stars just because of her on the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen was horrible the script was uninspired this was a movie that kept contradicting itself the film was sloppy and unoriginal its not like i was expecting a good film just something to give me a jump or two this did not even do that br br he worst thing is that the more i think about the overall plot the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding a real shame really as i'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere br br i'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4 10 but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent this film really should have delivered far more
<START> jeff fahey has such alert eyes and a insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous therefore it doesn't really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away drew barrymore fresh off her acclaimed role as poison ivy must have done this film simply as a favor to director phedon papamichael he was the cinematographer on ivy playing a character named daisy drew she's bumped off right away which leaves us with no one to look at but jeff fahey and sean young who hasn't had a single subtle moment on camera since blade runner this witless script by michael angeli concerns a police sketch artist who draws his own wife's face from a murder testimony and while that's not a bad idea for a plot it would be much better suited to an hour long tv series this cable made movie is short on inspiration beginning with the casting and shorter on surprises from
<START> okay br br i realize that there are some doubting thomas's out there i was one of them but then i saw this masterpiece of celluloid br br all i can say is that the scene in which george wendt gets sucked out of the spaceship by his a left me trembling i sometimes sit bolt upright in my bed screaming like an old man on a table thinking about it if the director is reading this i would pay to be an extra in the sequel
<START> im hoping this was made before half past dead and exit wounds because it was rubbish seagal wasnt to blame it was down to the crap directing when the few action scenes took place the plot was also confusing and basically just felt rushed out maybe it was shelved and released to capitalise on seagals newer films br br 3 10 br br he's not through yet bring on under siege 3 and loose some weight
<START> if you are 10 years old and never seen a movie before maybe this film may be entertainment for you but if you've seen several movies this one will be a silly fully cliched cheap and predictable for you don't waste your time with this
<START> well i saw this movie during the last san sebastian film festival the reaction to it was let's say as funny as the movie is it happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong spanish subtitles they seemed to be a translation from chinese to english and then to spanish it was all confusing the genders were switched girls appeared as boys and boys as girls and my friends and i remember great lines but because they were so absurd all in all not a good movie but if they ever show it on tv and you have nothing to do and if you want to laugh again not so much with the movie then go ahead visible secret is your film
<START> the muppet movie br br directed by br br james frawley br br kermit the frog and friends relive the tales and stories of how they all came together br br the muppets star in their first feature film bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture the story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts the well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction the cameos aren't just thrown in either but written in as interesting characters making one of the many peaks for our furry friends
<START> this movie just was not very funny there's not much else to say other than that it was kind of embarrassing for laurence fishburne and david hyde pierce both of whom deserve much better than this also i don't understand why after this movie completely and utterly bombed wb insisted on making it into a tv show
<START> the horror the film about the nazis the germans the murderers of babies young girls rapists for that they regret what are they interested in doing thousands of miles away from germany you do not come to mind is fascists are now good think killed tortured 27 million people no of course they do not want they were forced to hitler he gave each of them and forced to kill every fourth inhabitant of peace all jews gypsies killing the the facts at the beginning of the great patriotic war when taken prisoner by fascist german they were defiant and brazen we kill you all and so on since 1943 when they were taken captive they suddenly became anti fascists and peaceful peasants who were forced to hitler and personally for such films should be put to prison for life for the glorification of fascism br br if you want to see what they did yet went to stalingrad then watch the movie come and see 1985
<START> never has the words hidden gem been so accurate bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity sometimes coming up short with stuff like weasels rip my flesh but other times luck will prevail and you might end up with something like death bed then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all it just has a bad title and not even a bad title but a humorous one that might throw you off but somehow death bed still fits into the bad category with a vibe that's somber and empty death bed is a true masterpiece of low budget horror reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision br br death bed involves an incoherent yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being devoured by the yellow suds although not all that scary considering it's about a killer bed death bed possesses the qualities that make for successful horror a dark desolate vibe confusion an eerie subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts such a quality or vibe usually seems unintentional not only is it intentional but from what i've read death bed is based on an actual dream george barry the director successfully transferred dream to film only a genius could accomplish such a task br br old mansions make for good quality horror as do portraits not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid quite a bizarre dream indeed also this isn't quite the brand of b horror i was expecting considering the title and all before viewing this gothic gem i expected something more like class reunion massacre now thats a bad movie if you've seen it you know what i'm saying after considering all of the above i feel like death bed deserves only eight stars but since it stayed so obscure for so long we'll say the bed that eats deserves nine
<START> what can have been on irene dunne's mind when she accepted the role in this distasteful account of a woman of morals certainly the irene dunne of the 1940's whose reputation as a faithful roman catholic who publicly smut and shunned any film scripts or hollywood society that might be even be remotely construed as corrupting public morals would never have become associated with such a dubious project as this br br perhaps new york's cardinal spellman in his private audience with her gave her a good dressing down over this role that we will likely never know inasmuch as she never spoke of it in later years though she did denounce her morally suspect though quite successful 1932 film back street as trash br br certainly by the time she received the distinguished st robert award in 1965 for exemplary public catholicism ann vickers was no longer recalled by the general public br br suffice it to say that ann vickers works neither as entertainment or social commentary br br miss dunne's role as an adulterous social worker who sleeps around between reforming prisons and writing a best seller on correctional rehabilitation doesn't dovetail with her temperament or on screen demeanor and one keeps suspecting that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in cheek gag what else can we think when we witness a montage of miss dunne's sympathetic beatific gaze superimposed over a shot of a female prisoner being by films end she has renounced in favor of marriage to crusty convict walter huston no less and what kind of lunacy would ever conceive of pairing these two romantically br br irene dunne completists will no doubt wish to see this curiosity if only for the chance to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under her charge i'm going to get you off the snow cold turkey br br well if nothing else such sordid goings on do present her light years from her usual milieu of operatic chiffon and strawberry cocaine addiction not being the first subject one associates with the irreproachable miss dunne
<START> 'the is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and i mean this literally the film is about the journey about the world it shows during this journey the destination does not really matter in my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting in fact the story is pretty good br br we start with catherine deane jennifer lopez in the mind of a catatonic boy how this works exactly does not really matter but it looks a lot like virtual reality she and other scientist including henry west dylan baker and miriam kent marianne jean baptiste believe that this method might work catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there in a world that is completely created by the boy she hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results br br the real story then a serial killer named carl vincent d'onofrio just dumped the body of one of his victims fbi agents ramsey jake weber and novak vince vaughn are on this case another girl tara disappears and at that time after forensic research on the dumped body carl can be traced and captured two problems occur 1 carl just went into a coma he has been sick for a long time 2 his house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place in a way this part of the story is pretty standard br br things are about to get interesting again to find out where the girl is catherine has to go into carl's mind this is dangerous for a lot of reasons in short carl is unknown territory schizophrenic and a serial killer if catherine starts believing carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body she could die in the mind of carl a tape of how the last victim was killed a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours makes sure catherine will try to get the location out of carl's mind br br it is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching director singh who did music videos before this in a way goes back to these music videos every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images for me the visual style felt completely new the way 'three kings' had a new visual style one year earlier if something like that can make you like a film 'the will not disappoint but fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway the story itself without the great fantasy world is good enough for that i think you have to be a little open minded of course events are not yet possible in our real world still a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific
<START> this lesser known film starring roy thinnes from tv's invaders is actually what i consider a lost gem it was made at a time where the story was more important that the special effects though the effect are fairly good for its time a scientist that there is another world in earth's orbit directly behind the sun since the sun always blocks it from us we can never see it from earth roy thinnes is selected to go on a mission to get to this world i don't want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give the rest of the movie away let's just say there are some real surprises br br the movie is british and has that good british flavor of acting that was in such tv series like the avengers
<START> after his success with a nightmare on elm street in 1984 director wes craven for some reason decided that his next project would be this tv movie i'm not a big fan of this director on the whole early exploitation flick the last house on the left as well as his modern slasher scream sit well with me but the rest of his work is very hit and miss and i'd hesitate to call him the master that others have labelled him as the main theme here is freezing although it's more a springboard for the plot rather than an important part of the movie the main influence here is obviously the excellent 1974 zombie film and we focus on miles a businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident that means he has to be out immediately miles is a part of a project for people that are ill they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses can cured miles is successfully revived and it's seen as a miracle but the person that wakes up is not the person who was frozen as miles returns without a soul br br this film could actually have been quite decent judging by the idea behind it but instead we're given a plot that doesn't really have a lot to it and it has to be said that craven doesn't make the best out of the potential of the film the 'soul' is the main focal point but it would seem that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intent no compassion are the same thing which feels a bit unimaginative the film was made for television so it's not particularly nasty and it's obvious that not a lot of money was spent on it as the whole production feels very cheap michael beck never became a very popular actor and that isn't surprising judging by his performance here while he is passable he largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role the plot doesn't flow too badly but there's a real lack of suspense and or tension and things slow down too much too often which results in the film being rather boring on occasion it all boils down to a predictable ending also overall i have to admit that i was not impressed at all by this film and as far as craven's filmography goes chiller would have to go down with shocker the scream sequels and the hills have eyes ii as a miss
<START> coc had its moments i enjoyed the action sequences but i despised the screenplay and plot i hate this film so much i'll just write about the dumbest part first of all the plot would never happen second the bleakness of the chinese president was uncalled for that would never happen finally the dialogue employing non chinese actors to play chinese roles is understandable but to write dialogue for them that's totally off is dumb for those of you who understood the chinese in the film you know what i mean
