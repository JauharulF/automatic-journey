<START> one of eastwood's best movies after he had separated himself from the westerns which in themselves were good whenever i had a chance to see any of clint's earlier work i would sit in front of the set and watch whatever was on
<START> how is paw trunk or brain for dinner let tsui hark tell you in this wonderful and lighthearted comedy about the art of cooking the traditional chinese way br br this movie shares the common structure of an american sports movie but instead of focusing on baseball it centers around cooking which makes it all the more interesting i even think leslie character look a lot like charlie sheen in major league br br this movie also contains a bit of zhao wen zhao vs xiong fighting love seeing more of that after the blade and a quite funny in joke concerning a leon lai pop song br br perhaps not the ideal movie for the strict vegetarian though
<START> this movie was awful it centered too much around eddie clark griswald's brother in law eddie works much better when changing good quips such as in christmas vacation and vacation br br i really don't understand how a movie like this would be given the thumbs up now don't get me wrong i like randy quaid but just felt this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general this movie leaves much to be desired and really needed some bigger name actors
<START> i just love this movie and i have my tv programed to record it when it comes on again on nov 2nd it is a really nice love story with a twist the song that is played at the end of the movie is one you would not think would be a big hit but it is a song that stays in your head and i am now trying to find that song so i can hear it and play it i really have no style of the shows i see or the songs i like to hear and there for makes me pretty open to seeing things new with an open mind i would like to say there is some parts in this movie that is not meant for the whole family to watch this movie does show skin it is kinda like a lifetime movie for women about women i say watch the movie and you may just like it as much as i did
<START> this series is vastly underrated like many others i came upon farscape after the series had been cancelled bought season 1 and was surprised to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense romance wit and of course sci fi right off the bat it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero and every alien with whom he comes in contact speaks english okay a few others have the issue but farscape did it the best the point is the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible br br with so much bad programming out there it's a shame that balanced entertaining series such as farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production while we enjoy the four seasons and thankfully the four hour miniseries maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show
<START> this is possibly the worst of the worst i am a huge fan of the horror movie industry and i can believe this movie was allowed to be made the acting was juvenile and the story completely idiotic the camera work was also juvenile one scene that comes to mind is outside a store it is nighttime and you can see the moon yet the characters all have shadows that cast on the wall there was no street light to be seen one character gets gutted at one point yet manages to resurface later after removing herself from a post come on it felt like i was watching a middle school play i kept expecting the characters to wave to their family members off camera and mouth hi mom i can only give it two positive comments it ended and it was good for a laugh please do not rent this movie
<START> ok is barney the best children's show of all time of course not but in some of the comments left by other members of imdb you would think it was a multi million dollar production with high class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects well guess what it's barney for god's sake he shows children good behavior good and that it's ok to be who you are for those of you who find him annoying that is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you to the imdb member who wrote the review on the first page i think you may have gone a little too far did you actually describe a sesame street character as down to earth grow up everyone this is a great show for and actually does help children learn in a fun and creative way
<START> if you just want gore and nothing but gore and torture you've come to the right movie if you want a at least a sliver of good acting logic story or even a good guy ending go elsewhere br br i couldn't help but to think to myself are those people mentally challenged example after being chased around and seeing other people mutilated the main actress meets a police officer and spills out her story to the cop with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath that drives in a yellow truck the yellow truck pulls up and the officer just walks to it talks to the guy and the truck drives off without any trouble the actress comes out and says why didn't you arrest him and then the truck runs over the police officer after being rammed the truck stops on the road about 20 feet way just standing there while the actress tries to drag the cop away but he's too heavy at the time at that time the truck backs up and runs over the cops leg twice the truck then drives off why didn't the actress get the gun is beyond me which later she shoots the cop in the head twice because the psychopath was about to burn him alive once through the mouth which didn't kill him and twice to finish the job roll eyes right after that she turns away to escape the bathroom which was going to explode and when she climbs near the roof she turns around and the cop isn't there anymore ok br br another example the main actress meets a trapped woman in the bathroom she spits out like a gallon of blood on the floor covering about 1 of the room probably more after the main actress goes outside to grab a towel she comes back in and everything is gone they don't explain why everyone keeps disappearing either dumb dumb dumb br br i like horror thriller gore movies but this one was just way too dumb i lost brain cells watching this dribble and you shouldn't too
<START> this is classic disney at its live action cartoon best bumbling college student dexter riley kurt russell develops a mysterious liquid invisibility formula that actually makes objects disappear and helps him to save his cash strapped college further experimentation reveals that it works amazingly well on humans too startling discovery takes some hilarious new twists when a gang of crooks headed by the notorious a j cesar romero steal the formula and attempt to use it for their less than legal activities dazzling special effects and a fast paced story make this lively film a textbook case of college comedy i love this movie this movie has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy a pleasant little comedy that the entire family can enjoy not much violence or sex and absolutely no swearing makes this a movie that parents can watch with their children merely one in a series of kurt russell movies set at college a pleasant little series set in a wholesome america before terrorists when people valued integrity more than cash i highly recommend this movie
<START> i first saw the victim aka out of contention well over 25 years ago when i was very young being a passionate fan of bewitched since i was a child i loved to watch anything that starred elizabeth montgomery this movie was and still is a real treat whether you are a fan of miss montgomery's work or not elizabeth always shines in her roles such as her portrayal as the rape victim in a case of rape and as the suspected murderess in the legend of lizzie borden her performance in the victim as kate a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm with a killer after her is brilliant if you like exciting suspenseful thrillers than this is one movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end another great performance well worth mentioning is that of eileen who plays the eerie and suspicious housekeeper unfortunately like most of miss montgomery's movies the victim is not available on dvd and i believe that although it was released on vhs some years ago it is a rarity these days i was lucky to have taped it when it was aired on television some ten years ago and so have a nice copy of this very good movie a must see
<START> and i have seen a lot of films i saw this in the theatre in 1989 and to this day i remember the sickening urge to walk out if you like john belushi respect his talent or even the sanctity of the cinema this film has nothing to offer you it is mostly a pathetic showcase for the writer of belushi's biography bob woodward as we see the progression of belushi's life pass on the screen woodward actually shows up in the film like a ghost character the most offensive scene occurs when belushi is dying looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing above him and he weakly utters breathe for me woodward there are too many terrible things to mention them all the least of which is the opening that has belushi jumping out of his body bag in the morgue and getting into a taxi driven by a guy named angel i'll leave it at that
<START> i've rented this gem several times it's a small yet somehow sprawling masterpiece taking the viewer from manhattan glitz to the beauty of the greek islands john cassavetes on screen marriage to his real life wife gena rowlands is on the rocks he finds meaning in a fling with footloose susan sarandon whom he finds in greece while their daughter played in her earliest film role by the pubescent molly ringwald falls for the son of the greek shipping tycoon who is courting her mother on a yacht sailing in neighboring waters meanwhile the immensely talented raul julia plays a living in a cave with his sony he has the hots for molly ringwald's character until confronted by john cassavetes all comes together at the end in a classic closing scene where all is reconciled raul julia the is seen dancing with his goat this film is full of mysticism beauty young and old love humor sexiness and more see it
<START> the brilliant chuck jones master of warner bros cartoon comedy brings us the first pepe cartoon an alley cat tired of being pushed around paints himself in the colors of a skunk and with a healthy dose of limburger turns the tables on his tormentors then along comes pepe and you know the rest many of pepe's famous gags were born here including his chase hop in which he hops casually along while his prey runs himself to exhaustion br br in my opinion warner bros cartoons became less inventive and more ho hum in the 50s this 1947 is one of the few examples of mel blanc putting his absolutely crazy voice into pepe's mouth but the kicker is the ending where pepe is revealed to be an american wolf in clothing a must see classic warner bros
<START> i recently saw this film at a 3 d film festival in hollywood it was in polarized 3 d gray glasses not red blue it was so much fun to watch this film with an audience the print was excellent and the 3 d perfect the performances were over the top and that added to the fun the surprise ending that we aren't supposed to share with fellow movie at least according to the movie trailer and poster had people howling with laughter by today's standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3 d complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen this film was an entertaining romp into 50's horror
<START> there is a difference between a film and a movie a film regardless of quality is ready for public consumption a movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder in my time as a viewer i have seen may examples of both br br on september 19 i attended a screening of writer director jon donnybrook now having read the script and having seen two different cuts a rough cut and the finished product of this piece i can safely say it is a movie and a student movie at that it is for lack of a better word competent which is to say the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images the visuals are for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters i understand that this is a modestly budgeted film but some visual flair would have been appreciated and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested br br granted there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written engrossing story and some sharp dialog steven soderbergh's sex lies and videotape comes immediately to mind this movie however has neither the main story is weak and unfocused if the main plot is trying to mend his relationship with his father then i feel this movie misses the point what i got out of it is that main aspiration is to change the face of rock 'n' roll however we see very little activity on his part to show this while there is one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of his at the end all we seem to get are scenes of listening to music or casually strumming a guitar we are simply told that has played a lot of gigs but we never see him in full rock out mode next time show don't tell the audience anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this also doesn't look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970's he looks like he'd be more comfortable in the early days of rock 'n' roll posing as james dean's less talented brother in the meantime the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather clichÃ© characters and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency i e the subplot involving terry's father if i want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction i will consider watching napolean dynamite again a film i could barely make it through the first time br br as for the above mentioned dialog scenes i guess i should mention that they are few and extremely far between is it too much to ask for characters who do speak i don't think it is when the characters do speak it is in short choppy sentences collections of oh so insightful questions angered grunts or wildly over the top outbursts these characters simply do not behave like normal rational people working with material like this it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film al hudson's and that's just because he's doing a poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen a good director or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them however with being so close to the material he simply doesn't see them or if he does he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it'll hurt his creative vision being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner is the mark of a self indulgent misguided fool just ask rob schneider br br in the end we are left with a poor high school set knock off of zach amazing garden state combined with the equally amazing velvet goldmine two films far more worthy of your time br br now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this the best i can do is compliment mr for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see however the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur this is a student movie nothing more nothing less if the movie holds any promise and let's face it at this point it isn't going to come from the acting writing or directing it is this if if the people associated with this film are willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lessons learned on your next attempt don't attack your critics or have friend or family do it for you if you are able to do this maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution worthy of being called a film br br i am your audience and i am willing to watch
