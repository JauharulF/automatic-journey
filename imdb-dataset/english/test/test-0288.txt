<START> i can't believe that isaiah washington and ice t were in this mess the plot and i use that term very loosely centers around an army of rats that terrorize an urban apartment complex at least i think that's what it was about the script made no sense at all i couldn't have cared less about the characters and the camera work consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of rats standing on their hind legs or running running is what i should have done as an african american male i often read pleas from my brothers and sisters to support african american films i try to help out but enough is enough no one should watch garbage like this for any reason whatsoever please brothers and sisters don't produce any more direct to video rat turds like this please
<START> ok last night i saw the world premiere of paul schrader's the exorcist the beginning at the brussels international festival of fantasy films with all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipated br br the director was there and so were most of the stars except br br unfortunately the movie sucked big time it was a real disappointment for me because i'm a huge fan of both and friedkin's rip original 1973 film br br what was wrong with it most of it actually the fx you would think that the matrix and lotr digital revolution never happened it was so badly rendered the editing no real pace or rhythm the acting only at times could convince the script was a imo set up to explain the african scenes in the original film so the movie had the feel of a set up scene only it contributed nothing br br the only thing that i did like was vittorio cinematography although i've seen better from him now br br all of the time i was thinking this was just a rough cut a work in progress and that given the well known circumstances is probably what it is but that doesn't change the obvious problems with the script br br i had the chance to meet schrader very briefly but i didn't have the guts to tell him what i thought of the film and i was so nervous this is the guy who wrote taxi driver for christ sake that i forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his taxi driver script
<START> bergman's regular max von sydow and liv starred as a village couple jan and eva rosenberg the story began with an ordinary couple who fights and make up jan was a sensitive person but an escapist who isolated himself from the world eva is a practical woman who is getting fed up with her husband's lack of ambition because jan procrastinating in fixing their radio the are oblivious of the impending war of course the war arrived and the movie was a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and to each other through the invasion as they were mistreated by the enemy and by their own government br br there were no musical score to the movie but the soundtrack was the war noise in one scene the pulsating background gun shot the explosion and sound of the fly by planes was incredible now and then bergman zoomed into the facial expression as different event took places when something violent happened he zoomed out to let the audience sensed the violence rather than seeing up close very well done movie
<START> i like errol flynn i like biographies and i like action movies this featured all three of these but i didn't like this film it just went on too long although the last 20 minutes was excellent especially in the photography with some great low angle shots however i seemed like it took six hour to get to that point and i really can't say why i feel this way br br the action is interesting errol flynn and olivia de havilland are fine in fact it was refreshing to see de havilland actually be supportive of flynn instead of her normal role as antagonist to him yet something is lacking in this movie br br the film has been roundly criticized for its historical inaccuracy but i don't hear that same criticism for a lot of other films which have done the same in fact its rare when a film is historically accurate for some reason this revisionist history offended most critics if the film had made general custer a lot worse than he really was they would have probably liked it well too bad in their twisted way critics prefer villains to heroes br br i really wish i could have enjoyed this more but i'll take a lot of other flynn adventures over this one
<START> request you to not watch this movie it starts with a promise and as it goes on you crave for the movie to end predictable not entertaining at all wasted movie save your time and watch better thrillers the synopsis sounds good and that is why i watched the movie but it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start no great suspense no great direction nothing phenomenal with the acting shy away from this low rating nothing to write about this movie so i am filling up the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time waster this movie is really irritated at how good a premise that was and how bad a screenplay was written out of it
<START> this is a comedy version of strangers on a train it works pretty well i am a harsh grader so the 3 rating reflects mostly on the characters and plot the performances are extremely good all of them of course the two stars devito and crystal shine most each performer acts well enough to play off of the comedy works in a level just short of slapstick devito characters work best when depraved his character portrayed as a writing hack would probably be more real if he was published and lauded as much as most hacks are his character would in real life have a great agent and multiple the characters are one dimensional which is okay in comedy but character is not written very well his desire to kill the all of a sudden makes no sense at all it looks like a pitiful attempt at humor the pitiful attempts are not too often and the movie flows fairly well
<START> br br when this film was released i dismissed as being lightweight pop nonsense that was a mistake br br after repeated viewings and seeing a documentary of the making of dirty dancing discovering the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal br br dirty dancing is a film about change the evolving nature of relationships within the family the changes in one's view of the world during their coming of age etc the story takes place during august of 1963 the final weeks of the last summer of innocence for the american people the many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in american society that would be marked by the kennedy assassinations and vietnam br br female movie adored this film and repeated trips to the movie houses made it the world's most successful dance movie as a male i find the romantic pairing of ultimate stud patrick swayze with very plain jennifer grey very hard to accept this would be fatal for most romantic dramas and it also may have create the intense dislike expressed by most male reviewers br br the film's soundtrack found 1 status before the release of the movie to this day it is nearly impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a dirty dancing song br br near the midpoint of the film baby's mother wakes up and asks baby's father is anything wrong br br baby's father the anti change family member attempts to keep all that is happening a secret he tells his wife to go back to sleep however resist as one can change is dirty dancing is the story of one person waking up just at the final moments of our country's last sleep in innocence
<START> i decided to watch this movie because i'd not seen carol lombard before in any movie i'm sorry it had to be this one because quite frankly this is a dog Â and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn both of whom were great actors br br the problem with the film is simple it tries to put too much too quickly in to a story about a young lawyer john manson played by stewart who marries jane played by lombard within an hour of meeting her what's that clichÃ© marry in haste repent at leisure br br in short the story is a series of episodes that show the couples' financial status their troubles with john's live in mother their struggles to pay the bills john's diminished status at the office the arrival of their baby son john jnr unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother the couples' angst about their marriage the baby's sickness which worsens thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot in a fierce storm to bring a special serum to save the child and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm br br how many more clichÃ©d situations could the writers include maybe mother dying soon after there wasn't much comedy the drama was lacklustre at best the dialog was painful to hear only the acting of the four main players was adequate br br this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn Â during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie br br so it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol' home spun american values of family relationships heroism perseverance and initiative Â all against the backdrop of the average american family who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard br br and it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939 so it was planned in 1938 Â soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii hence this sort of film was a great booster for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join england in war as many here would know hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before during and after the war br br however i'm glad i saw it Â as a piece of disguised socio political propaganda but i'll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range br br as another reviewer noted see this one just to say that you've seen all of stewart's movies otherwise don't bother
<START> one of my co workers recommended this one implying that it was one of the most frightening movies she ever watched i checked it out together with my girlfriend and we gave up after 50 minutes or so br br yesterday i had a long talk with my co worker we're still friends br br this movie is as original as the latest film starring steven seagal it brings absolutely nothing original to the table the spooky parts have been done thousand of times before br br the biggest fault however is the painfully slow pace of this movie the periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialog and a lot of nothing br br 1 of 10 molotov cocktails
<START> jackass number two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006 beating the also hilarious clerks ii it is one of the best sequels in recent memory beating jackass the movie in every way now this film may be the funniest but it is also the most offensive appalling and utterly disgusting you will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film i'm completely serious when i say don't eat anything before watching or during this film because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you keep the drinking to a minimum as well you've been warned because just like the tagline says it will make you beg for mercy br br jackass number two follows the crazy men from the hit show jackass johnny knoxville bam ryan dunn steve o chris 'party boy' pontius preston lacy dave england brandon and jason man' chris is absent as they perform the most outrageous life threatening and revolting stunts imaginable i'm not going to tell what the stunts are but i will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening and that one cast member once again not telling will flirt with death several times in the film br br what makes jackass number two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them to put it simple if they loved doing it and had a blast you will too this goes for 99 of the stunts all the stunts are very original and 90 of them are never before seen you will witness a few recycled ones but they're amped up you wouldn't think directing really factors into a movie like this but it does jeff tremaine's direction makes the movie so much funnier because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing which is simply brilliant on his part he could have just sat back and slept throughout filming actually you'll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could i give mr tremaine two thumbs up for that another great thing about jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos and this time they include bmx legend mat hoffman skateboard god tony hawk director actor jay chandrasekhar super troopers actor luke wilson miami dolphins star jason taylor and director actor mike judge office space the scenes with hoffman taylor and chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film as it's even funnier to see these men as a part of the film br br jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect morally degrading and just plain wrong movies of all time if not the most despite this it is so original and so hilarious that you won't care about that you'll be gasping for air laughing so hard you'll be crying and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film no one under 18 should watch this film you've been warned i hope you enjoy jackass number two as much as i did br br 10 10 spy
<START> the year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns 'the by henry king and by john ford 'the was historically notable as it clearly influenced 'high 1951 and later revisionist westerns br br however i personally find superior to it's contemporary counterpart ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west although optimistic and warm at heart we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring frontier scenery is well used as it supports the poetic narrative perfectly add naturalistic camera work and we are transported among the mormon travellers to witness western folklore told in cinematic means
<START> imagine what it must have been like for john agar one of hollywood's handsome leading men married to shirley temple for five years he finds himself doing movies like this i remember him in tarantula where he wasn't half bad unfortunately there is nothing to recommend this film the monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent the police are boring the teenagers are boring the plot is stupid people run around there are events that do nothing to advance the plot there's dancing that goes on and on and then there is no attack there is some idiotic love triangle that no one could care the least about it isn't even campy or outrageous it's just no worth anything agar might as well have been a post he's given nothing to do
<START> don't listen to most of these people ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love its about jill johnson played by camilla belle who babysits at the house and someone breaks in if you're wondering how he got in the house he went through the garage most likely so anyway don't listen to the worst acting it has amazing acting with a great story i think that there are 2 benefits that jill has 1 shes a fast runner and is on the track team 2 she got out alive lol br br it is a cool movie and quite scary check it out you will be happy with this masterpiece don't listen to the other people on the site its very good trust me i am good at reviewing movies i'm a future movie critic i totally want to buy this movie and you will too when you see it it is amazingly awesome
<START> i have reasons to love the great users of a camera fluid direction of action lends itself to fast paced adventure and comedy narrative but such a skill in the hands of a king vidor or an anthony mann can also be applied to idea level work this is paul masterpiece its storyline can be in a single pair of sentences general hector is setting up as near emperor in northern mexico and steals a huge cannon from general blackjack he sends his crack mission unit divided apprehensive but determined led by george peppard to get the cannon back and bring back alive to put an end to the rebellion charismatic raf plays the ladies in the piece are giovanna ralli and francine york with the squad even further comprised of nico peter and don gordon other stalwarts in the class include john and john russell also in on an already fantastically dangerous operation are miss ralli and a stubborn mexican whose regiment was betrayed when set up on his own the danger is multiplied when gordon's brother as advance spy is captured and tortured to death while he has to watch and he decides he needs to kill peppard the attack that captures the cannon when orders are not by a regular army type is one of the most electrifying visual and staging achievements in cinematic history the penetration of stronghold the revelations uncovered there and the actions that win the mission team a chance at victory or almost victory are flawlessly presented this is a beautiful color adventure film with unusually strong costumes acting lighting art direction sets and music by elmer bernstein the script by stephen is probably his best ever for a feature film this is probably the most underrated major western at the moment but i have always appreciated its heroes as result getting hard workers but as peppard reminds his group on the way home the trouble with being a hero is the morning after to find out why he says so you will have to see cannon for
<START> the rap the book this movie was 'based' on was one of the most difficult books i've ever read yet i could not put it down raunchy crude foul lewd you name it it had it it also had some of the best characterizations of any novel i've ever read br br well as for the flick it was deplorable i mean tim mcintire as was the baddest mutha talking 'bout mcintire as is like casting tim conway as charles manson br br what happened to the main character in the book little he doesn't even exist in the movie fast walking was not the main dude in the book why even name credit this thing with the rap none of the spirit atmosphere nastiness or drama of the book was captured in this movie br br for me it was not only a disappointment but a total waste of time and celluloid
