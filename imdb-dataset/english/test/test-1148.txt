<START> ok fans it's out on dvd but the only reason to watch this is 1 to say you did due to its notoriety or 2 if you're a hardcore bill paxton fan i am not a hardcore bp fan but he was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off from sheer boredom it's a shame because this could have been a good movie with some script work and if made by someone with some intelligence and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and talentless judd nelson sure it's gross but it's bad and not in a good way if after reading all the comments on how bizarrely revolting and filthy this movie is you are still interested do yourself a favor and see some good bizarre revolting dystopian filth instead films by john waters david lynch peter jackson's braindead henenlotter's basket case etc all come to mind there's lots better out there
<START> br br 12 grand is the cost of a new car a new car that jake west now needs to escape the hordes of angry villagers desperate for his blood some may say this film could attract so bad it's good status in my opinion it is the proud owner of the so bad it's bad label
<START> br br first of all i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed the la punks br br i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in finland br br so if you don't like this kind of music why you write here about it i like this kind of music it speaks my soul thus i know punks from all over europe americas so why do you who find this music repugnant care to comment at all br br
<START> another eli roth in the making self promoting bad script writing excuse for a horror director victor is as far from the new horror icon as mary poppins reference to the disney score what is going on here you have marilyn manson opening and closing this piece of crap and chitty chitty bang bang all through it can this even be called horror horrible yes but horror is a stretch david lynch should sue them for stealing the elephant man prosthetics please stop these fan boy want to be directors now the video directors already have enough competition breaking into the film industry getting online and talking about how great your movie is does not make it true stop the insanity i work in the industry and yes these films are fun to work on but rarely ever entertaining to actually watch
<START> 4 son my game mad yo i cant wait 2 get on dis show and roll up in da club n do it real style wit mad models n bottles son br br no i'm just kidding this is a sad show created by and for the enjoyment of sad men men who are so neutered by modern existence that they channel their frustration into the clubs where they eke out fleeting self validation preying on chicks in hopes of getting their little touched to try and dull the sting of loneliness and make them feel even if just for one night as though their seat on the board of the sausage party of toronto is a little less permanent br br i read some comments on here saying that this show represents canadian tv's finally stepping up to stand on a par with american tv or well that's not aiming short at all it's like yes pat yourself on the back canada you've finally cracked the elusive formula for such groundbreaking american content as studs change of heart and the fifth wheel see the real brainchild here is meets candid camera onto the pitch genius and there's nothing that that thin line between fratboy camaraderie and latent homosexuality like a group of grown men taping each other on hidden camera admiring each other's game up in the club the man love on display here is so palpable they should really consider it keys to the steam bath br br on a side note how interesting that the folks who gave this show such glowing reviews seem to have registered an imdb account for the express purpose of doing so i guess i'm guilty of employing the same means to do the opposite here my personal favorite is the one enthusiastic reviewer that claims to hail from the united states who gushes that now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television br br smooth br br but why even bother manufacturing online buzz you can't really get cancelled after all you're on the comedy network in canada baby the viewing public will go on ignoring your show for years to come in all likelihood you'll be just fine coasting comfortably along that proverbial plain of mediocrity with the majority of the comedy network's original programming
<START> i turned this off within the first five minutes it's very sick and disturbing the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse and it's skull was punctured by a small tubed instrument this creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died the narrator said the animal dies instantaneously it didn't i don't agree with graphic realism towards animals insects or any living creature i was very disappointed as i had just watched 'eyes without a face' which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached which spoilt my night as i couldn't hurt a fly never mind watching this savage documentary br br reading other reviews on this page i had noticed they used words such as aesthetic this is not art or beauty i can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic
<START> i recently rented this video after seeing final ascent by the same writer i wasn't prepared for how intense this film would get i found it engaging from start to finish and was rooting for the teenagers to get away with their attempted crime the ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence but well done i highly recommend this picture
<START> it's painfully clear that all effort in this film was directed toward cinematography and very little attention to everything else most obvious mistake is the miscast of the entire female cast many of them are very experienced and capable but they all seemed out of place and having an amateur director certainly didn't help the story is a very common geisha story and characters behaved very inconsistently thus making it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine br br this movie's theme is modern prostitution but still it was annoying how anna's lead character kept talking like a female motorcycle gang member while everyone else spoke in old japanese fitting for this setting this movie has very beautiful vibrant colors similar to zhang yimou's hero but viewers can easily tell it's filmed in a cheap elaborate set br br the two sequences with shiina insert songs were really nice though in mid section of the movie i actually really disliked her music before but they fit perfectly in this movie although is a complete failure as a film director she has a major potential in pv music video production br br i believe the story felt very plain because the director failed to focus on character development and because anna's unconvincing acting as an oiran had this film been directed by a known director with any other known actress in japan it would've had the potential to become a masterpiece
<START> if you thought herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in 'the love was daft wait 'till you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel dean jones is back as the driver who competes in the paris to monte carlo rally this time his sentient vw falls in love with another car in the race a driven by julie by this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in rides again' the movie is overlong and threadbare although it's watchable thanks to the return of jones's typically likable performance a few funny bits and the cast's frantic mugging
<START> this little film is hysterical full of stereotypes about gays straights dwarfs british tea and pubs american gun culture divorce and marriage yet it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each kathy bates is amazing grace beasley and as a character actor of staggering range she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in fried green with the help of other comedic talents like dan as max her ex lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown chicago and rural england the story is just intriguing enough to entertain jonathan price plays victor fox a closet gay singer murdered by a cross bow killer in chicago his valet lover dirk simpson played by the stunning rupert everett must overcome victor's siblings including lynn redgrave who want to turn their home into a tribute museum and teams with bates and her dwarf daughter in law beasley to find the killer among the homeless of chicago br br the entire cast sing at various points in the pursuit and are excellent esp the talented price and bates this implausible storyline both funny and bizarre is one of the most off center films cameos by julie andrews barry and sally jesse raphael should tell you just how bizarre this film truly is strange funny and off center but with a good perspective about people with every kind of difference
<START> a german freshman stefan hitch hikes to paris during summer break were he falls for a mysterious young woman he meets in the paris freak scene he then follows her in the famous isle of ibiza the hippie joint were meets wolf a man who throws hitler knives owns bars and hotels and keeps estelle under his thumb with dope the couple tries to escape wolf stefan gets hooked with dope and jealousy for estelle who's groovy and a free spirit great photography and music plot is quite usual for the period but it's not an exploitation kind of movie cold and dramatic the moral is quite strong he was looking for the sun but i would not say it's a film against drugs even it puts on drug use
<START> i was expecting a lot from mr amitabh bachan's role of sarkar but am disappointed being a ram gopal verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie sarkar is supposed to be a strong character but the movie shows that amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his there is a movie in tamil called based on the theme of god father and kamala hassan has played the lead the movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of kamala hassan not his son amitabh bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things the movie fails to show the strong impact of god father
<START> having just got the loony tunes golden collection which i highly recommend by the way i'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually as such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them for this i apologize br br rabbit seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like minded shorts the other two being rabbit fire and duck rabbit duck bags and daffy argue about who elmer fudd should short it makes me laugh every single time on the dvd it has a commentary featurette option to play it music only br br my grade a br br dvd extras disk 1 an introduction by chuck jones the boy of termite part 1 clips from the films two guys from texas and my dream is yours both with bugs cameos bridging sequences for an episode of the bugs bunny show the astro nuts audio recording session 2 vintage trailers blooper bunny bugs bunny 51st and a half anniversary with optional commentary with writer greg ford stills gallery
<START> i'm at a loss for words this movie is beyond description i don't believe there is a language on earth that has a word that can describe how horrible this movie is if you do attempt to watch it be sure to stick around for the suprise ending i only made it about three quarters of the way through this piece of crap before i couldn't take it anymore fortunately or unfortunately a couple of my buddies stayed till the end when they woke up from their coma and after a couple of weeks of therapy they were able to fill me in on what i had missed this movie has no story no plot horrible writing and even worse acting if you enjoy watching train wrecks or auto accidents then this film is for you i think my iq dropped about 30 points from watching this insert expletive here
<START> this film is a perfect example that a movie can not be successful with a high budget alone it's obvious that there was a lot of time and effort dedicated into this the animation is fluid detailed and superb the soundtrack isn't too memorable except for the ending song by celine dion at least i think it was her the musical score is powerful full orchestra material kudos to the animators and music composers 9 10 however the story and characters fall flat it feels very 'been there done that' predictable and plain uninteresting the characters have distinct personalities but nothing too likable they annoyed me to no end i tried really hard to like this but i didn't care about the story it was clichÃ© action adventure plot there were 'jokes' that weren't funny it was vomit inducing predictable from start to end the dialogue was clichÃ© and awful especially the last line it's not that gives you wings it's love whatever it was i remember cringing i was wishing it would hurry up and finish i wasn't the only one either the people i went with thought it was boring please watch the asterix and cleopatra film if you're going to watch any this was a waste of time
