<START> this is a good family movie with a few laughs i wish it didn't have too much of the school stuff like the bully in it to fill the movie up also it seems a little too easy to save a piece of land from being built i mean the it just flowed too easily it does make you aware of the wildlife it had a cute way of introducing the piece of land which the fast runner but a little too slow for me a little too hokey for me and it reminded me of going back to school oh the dvd is chock full of goodies so don't miss out 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out 10 for the dvd with the extras that is well worth to watch well worth your time to see this
<START> an unflinching descent into psychological and physical oblivion that will undoubtedly burn images of the truthful brutality and suffering of war into your cerebral in a way not many other films will in fact there is simply no other war film like it br br director kon ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of hiroshima first hand only 10 days after the bomb was dropped he has said that from that day it would always be his mission to express the pointless empty violence humans inflict on each other and themselves br br mr ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in war for the paths to victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers marching down roads which only have death and destruction at their end br br mr ichikawa succeeds in bringing his message to the world thru this haunting piece of cinema
<START> vincenzo a man that has spent years working at a steel mill as a maintenance man that the italian owners are selling to the chinese comes at the end of the meeting where the purchase is being arranged because he wants to tell the new buyers of a flaw he has discovered and he thinks he has the solution he doesn't exactly endear himself to the italian old management or to the new chinese owners he even fights with the translator about the exact term he wants to use in expressing his concern br br the next thing we see is vincenzo arriving in china trying to contact the new owners to his amazement there is someone new in charge as mr chong the man he tried to warn in italy has been fired his next quest is getting to the woman that was the translator liu he finds her working in a library but she tells him in no uncertain terms she blames him for being fired from her position liu who sees the desperation of vincenzo agrees to accompany him to find his steel mill plant br br thus vincenzo and liu begin a voyage through some of the bleak countryside that involves traveling by train steamship bus and truck to remote parts of the giant country finding the correct factory proves to be elusive at best but vincenzo discovers a life that is completely alien to him as well as finding a kind soul who doesn't hesitate to help the italian man in spite of her initial distaste for him br br gianni film is a sort of travelogue he takes the viewer into unknown territory some comments compare vincenzo to marco polo the great italian traveler although the similarities are not quite tangible the film keeps our attention in the early stages of the trip but it starts getting somewhat less enjoyable as vincenzo gets stranded after separating from liu mr is an interesting director as he clearly demonstrates with this film for which he worked on the adaptation of rea's novel which we haven't read br br sergio castellitto is the sole reason for watching the film this versatile actor brings a lot to the movie which in a way is a tour de force for him as he is seen in almost every frame of the picture the combination of and castellitto proves to be a winning combination ling tai who is making her debut as liu has some lovely moments and shows good chemistry with her co star br br luca photographed the chinese landscape in all its bleakness we see a china that is not picture post card pretty mr captures all the so typical of the areas where the film is set franco musical score serves the film well
<START> i liked most of the dialogue i liked the cast i thought it was well acted i particularly enjoyed ellen perfect deadpan performance br br what didn't work for me was 1 the drawn out affair with the younger man too long too seemingly out of character for helen 2 the seemingly endless cinematic cliches mostly visual but including interminable voiced over re readings of the love letter itself its contents should have a mystery 3 a young woman feminist scholar and ironically a fireworks scene no wonder this reminded me of that horrid how to make an american quilt movie 4 the bumbling gotcha cop who smells dope everywhere no cliche there either and 5 a nauseatingly romanticized small town setting br br i would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of or even glorify helen's bitterness to have included much more of character to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices and to be a little less uncritical of small town life br br had it been developed as a play first those criticisms might have been addressed before committing the material to this film which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre
<START> i am a talent manager i have been for 15 years now i have discovered some wonderful talent they have been in movies commericals and television in my opinion eddie monroe was cast wonderful i love seeing the ability of real people not just a name the actors in this movie were very natural and believable i was very entertained by this film i love a movie with a few twists i also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved i still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money when you see the flick you will understand what i am saying the mobsters all look real i would like to see this film on the big screen the footage was shot really well the scenery of new york was the new york that i know have a happy 2006 and may this movie make it to the awards
<START> i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan stand point br br i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear how wrong was i br br the main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goings on sword fights and the like br br you got some gore but everything else was just pretty life less the middle section just seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horse drawn carts and even slower dialogue and character development br br on the plus side costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interest br br i think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the tempo and go for a 12a rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the film br br or go really art house with tone direction etc but that's fairly high risk as far as box office is concerned br br oh well perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it
<START> steven seagal has made a really dull bad and boring movie steven seagal plays a doctor this movie has got a few action scenes but they are poorly directed and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie a group of american nazis spread a lethal virus which is able to wipe out the state of montana wesley seagal s character tries desperately to find a cure and that is the story of the patriot the patriot is an extremely boring film because nothing happens it is filled with boring dialogue and illogical gaps between events and stupid actors steven seagal has totally up in this movie and i would not recommend this guff to my worst enemy 3 10
<START> guilt and redemption are two of the staple emotions and plot elements of the heavy powerful dramas that the oscars love so much which is kind of funny since the kite runner was only nominated for best original score the lack of nominations was perhaps unjust while most film adaptations of books or any other means are usually inferior to their literary counterparts and the kite runner is not an exception marc forster's film adaptation is a good one br br most people are familiar with the story the book having been read by millions so i won't go into the plot except to say that the book stays pretty faithful to its source that being said if you don't know the plot see the movie or better yet read the book br br the best thing the kite runner has going for it other than its story is director marc forster forster is a director with epic scope and unique vision that is perfectly utilized in bringing book to the screen a small part of me worried that he would use the same dreamy images that were included in one of forster's earlier features finding neverland don't get me wrong finding neverland is a wonderful film one of my favorites actually but the visual trickery he used in there doesn't have a place here fortunately forster understands that and the brilliance of his direction shows his versatility though the lack of a best director nomination for his work here is not exactly a travesty i see a number of statuettes in store for him down the road br br also of note is the screenplay adaptation it remains faithful to the source but it leaves room for forster's vision to interpret the material the dialogue is not dumbed down and it along with forster's direction moves at a solid pace like forster the lack of recognition at awards time for the screenplay was not an outrage but i wouldn't have complained if it was at least nominated br br the dividing line here between this film being great and outstanding lies with the acting most of the performances are solid but there are some that don't quite make the cut and it hurts the film the most notable weak performance comes from who plays the young amir it's not that it's bad it's just that it's not as effective as it could be he just can't translate the guilt that consumes amir to the audience in fact i think i might have been a little lost at this point in the movie at this point had i not read the book because of this he looks somber and at times resentful but we can't feel his emotions this is a difficult part to portray and for the most part young holds his own which is especially surprising since this is his first film role br br the best performances come from who plays the adult amir and shaun who plays the wise kahn may not be a known name though he was in paul greengrass's united 93 but his work here is amazing he's a quiet modest man and he emotes perfectly when needed to a lesser capable actor could have made the character of khan into a clichÃ© but shaun uses enough subtlety and care in his performance that he creates what the clichÃ©s are trying to portray br br forgive me if i go on a rant here but this is something that i must address and that is the film's pg 13 rating the fact that this film received such a low rating is outrageous there is no justification for it some could argue that the rating was bent because of the need for everyone to see it like the gore in saving private ryan which some say should have earned the film an nc 17 rating but that exception cannot be applied here the only purpose the scene serves is to tell the story forster probably at the behest of the producers tried as hard as he could to tame the film's most painful and disturbing scene to allow the film to sneak by with a pg 13 rating but the subject material is too disturbing to be depicted in any way and get less than an r rating regardless of if how tasteful is may be portrayed worse this editing robs the scene of much of its power and by trying it make it less disturbing to get the lower rating is insulting furthermore some scenes of violence are incredibly disturbing as well in terms of how much time these scenes take of the movie it doesn't add to much but what is there is well deserving of an r rating at the very least the mpaa whose system of rating movies has always been corrupt has sunk to a new low by giving this film such a low rating br br but one shouldn't fault the film for this the film is a solid film that is well worth seeing especially if they are fans of the book
<START> as a person god how i hate that phrase i just happened to catch this on cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch overall it was a fantastic movie yes i was a little disappointed upon finding out that neither actor is disabled and yes i was a little disappointed that more of the movie wasn't filmed from the 'true' point of view of the disabled can you imagine what it's like always being the tallest person in the room and then having to live the rest of your life with a view of nothing but other people's asses and crotches having to always wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only handicapped stall enduring everyone else's rude bodily while you wait and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me been there done that literally but the movie was true enough to matter while i've never lived in a home or assisted residence there were plenty of times throughout the movie where i found myself nodding and saying to myself yeah that's true that's happened to me what impressed me is that some of the commentors on this board expressed the fact that the movie made them view life a little differently and with a little more insight as the lives of a silent can't ask more than that out of a movie that it makes you think and view life differently so by virtue of that alone the movies was tremendously successful should be required viewing of every kid in junior high school br br pretty much for every person that's severely physically disabled independence is one of if not the most important focus of our daily lives from working to socializing to recreating for those of you who felt the movie was ' try living our life for a single day you'll see that the movie was because it's true the challenges the actors faced only skimmed the surface of what happens to us every day if we're lucky we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters including the girl did every day presents obstacles for us to overcome it's just that there's no swelling dramatic music to accompany our lives unless it's in our lol
<START> armed and dangerous is not one of the greats of john candy this film about a fired cop who ends up working for a small security system run by the mob is very weak and not very much a comedy there are some moments that i did enjoy like looking at candy in a pilot suit but it doesn't seem to matter much armed and dangerous is still a dangerously disappointing dud brought to us by the director of the equally dumb actioner commando what a sad excuse for a comedy br br 1 out of 5
<START> during a lifetime of seeing and enjoying thousands of films feeling minnesota is absolutely the worst major film with a list stars that i have ever seen bar none this movie totally fails on every level it's poorly photographed and edited there's uninspired acting the kind where the actors appear bored out of their minds just collecting paychecks perhaps and worst of all the script appears to have been written under the influence of some unpleasant substance found only in sewers i can't even begin to comprehend how the writer director could ever have found anyone to finance this project let alone attract any of the stars that it did i truly wish i could get back the time that i wasted watching this piece of garbage if possible i would have given this film a grade of zero better yet a negative number
<START> shadows and fog is surely one of woody allen's weakest films right up there with september and hollywood ending though nothing allen has done equals the awfulness of anything else br br shadows and fog is allen's homage to the german expressionist style of film making all stark and stylized light and shadow and you guessed it lots of fog but you can tell allen got caught up in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would care about br br luckily he made husbands and wives the same year so things weren't a total wash for him br br grade d
<START> it's a shame house calls isn't better known is it perhaps because the romantic leads are middle aged shopworn and gun shy rather than oversexed teen stars could be if you're over 35 you'll probably get this comedy if you're over 45 you're really going to get this comedy if you're 25 wait until you're older to see it br br the unlikely pairing of matthau and jackson works precisely because it is so unlikely there's a wonderful line of matthau's that sums up what is happening between the two of them i like old broads because you don't have to explain who ronald coleman is if that's not the exact line it's close br br the premise of a sub par hospital run by incompetents rings true art portrayal of a senile head surgeon is absolutely brilliant it is impossible not to laugh out loud at his delivery subplots if you can call them that are fun too like between matthau and jackson's teenage son everything hits just exactly the right tone br br okay there's the bit where matthau has to wear women's clothing that's a bit over the top and an easy mark but still it's walter matthau in drag it's funny
<START> this film is brilliant without a doubt watched it a while ago after constant from family members who are right into their sci fi films which i am not and thought it was quite good but after recently watching a few documentaries on outer space etc we watched it again and it is good br br kevin spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and i really like jeff bridges big blown away arlington road the film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet yeah right you think but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth br br that is how the story evolves with bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with as he is known his own psychiatric colleagues his wife and family his brother in law and his astronomer work colleagues who after getting some data from pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth a great film that get's you wondering br br 8 10 dave
<START> if you don't like mel brooks you won't like this film that's a given why anyone wouldn't like his films is unknown to me but for those who can't see the light just avoid it br br everyone else this is a classic the entire cast is perfect carey elwes is a dashing clever british robin hood amy yasbeck overacts appropriately as marion richard lewis is his usual distracted annoyed self roger rees is a brilliant combination of and violence as mervyn the sheriff of and dave chapelle eric allan kramer mark blankfield and the sadly underused matthew are the perfect merry men br br there are similarities to spaceballs blazing saddles and every other mel brooks movie but why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well the pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again from the view of a 16 year old at least it's complete and utter parody every second a play for a laugh some of them don't work but most do and well i discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time i watched the film br br of course if being barraged by constant visual and verbal gags isn't your style you wouldn't like this this isn't an academy award winner it's mel brooks you know what it is when you're getting into it if you want nonstop laughter surprisingly well developed characters and catchphrases to last a lifetime watch this
