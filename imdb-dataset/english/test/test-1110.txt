<START> i managed to see the mtv premiere of this movie last night and i needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder obviously this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the d as it has plenty of in jokes for those that have seen the hbo series and has more than enough d for newer fans and the mass of soon to be converts the music really shines with the new songs which is much better than it sounds master possibly the 3rd best song in the world and dude i totally miss you there are a load of excellent scenes the car chase the rock off the meeting and cameos including dave as satan i really could go on for hours but i don't want to give the movie away go see it you won't be disappointed
<START> i chose this movie really for my husband who works in radio broadcasting i thought that it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and relate too though it was from the eighties so it was a little dated this movie really draws you in at times you just want to strangle the host barry at times you just want to send some of the bigots who call in to a true concentration camp at times you really feel sorry for barry because he has truly gotten too big for his jeans if you know what i mean it was on the drama channel on encore so i am thinking this is a true story if you truly love dramas you will love this even if you don't know all the ins and outs of the broadcasting business if you are an alec baldwin fan and are watching it to see him you shouldn't his part is really a bit part in this movie
<START> this movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going the first scene shows a life flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background for those of you who might not ever have been to houston there is no elevation change the city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft incline is considered a big hill to go along with that scenery any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in houston the trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees neither of which houston has very much of even the hospital itself on the outside is very unbelievable memorial hermann hospital is one of the top hospitals in the united states and sits smack dab in the middle of the medical district just miles from downtown houston yet every outside shot of the hospital makes it appear that the hospital is out in the suburbs or even the countryside br br it is obvious that whoever was in charge of the actual tropical storm part of the movie skimped out because the numerous shots of radar are all wrong the first radar image in the movie is that of hugo hitting south carolina we later see kris kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistants tells him that alison is moving back south across houston yet the radar image he shows has alison clearly moving north off of the gulf of mexico into houston probably the initial landfall of alison br br as for the acting it isn't all that bad jobeth williams kris kristofferson and rick schroder all do a decent job considering that this is a straight to tv movie the plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more entertaining my one problem with the acting is the portrayal of with big thick southern accents the actors all sound like they are from birmingham alabama and not houston texas br br the movie gets its point across and to the general audience it does exactly what it is meant to entertain if you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of houston in june of 2001 then you will be disappointed one thing to keep in mind before viewing this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of memorial hermann hospital and not on tropical storm alison and the impact on houston metro itself if you are looking for a factual account of tropical storm alison's impact on houston metro might i suggest watching the weather channel's storm stories for tropical storm alison br br 1 2 out of
<START> 1930's comedy mystery about the crooked circle a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them enjoyable but really unremarkable little film the movie works simply because the cast headed by zazu pitts and james gleason both of whom would later appear together in a couple of withers films after edna mae oliver dropped out of that series and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of i don't hence the lack naming a breezy hour long romp the movie doesn't make a great deal of sense with mistaken identity secret passages ghostly music and people not being who they seem its the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a late night viewing when one is nostalgic for the late late show

<START> after a summer full of retreads and disappointments nurse betty is a breath of fresh air the film is like no other i have ever seen director neil labute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex his previous two films were the brillant in the company of men and the almost brillant your friends and neighbors renee zellweger gives the best performance of her career as betty a waitress who when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband labute mainstay aaron and gets lost in a fantasy world morgan freeman and chris rock play the who killed her husband and are now on her trial the trick to the film is that freeman and zellweger are really parallel characters while zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite dr dave on a soap opera freeman betty nurse betty is a brillant film full of life humor love and graphic violence my grade 10 10
<START> the main reason i loved this movie is because formerly immature were in it they were in house party 3 when they were 11 but they are all grown up now i was a little shocked at some of the things they were doing in the movie almost ready to tear my hair out but i had to realize that they were not my little boys anymore i think chris did a pretty good job considering that is was his first movie
<START> i saw this movie years about 8 years ago when it first came out and the only memories that i have about it are 1 that it was awful 2 that in one scene linnea quigley applies suntan lotion to her arms and legs repeatedly for about 15 minutes straight it seemed that long anyways 3 one scene where a character gets a sledgehammer rammed into his head in this scene when the hammer connects the head smashes like glass it's quite bad
<START> surface was one of the few truly unique shows on tv last season i can honestly say i modified my schedule so i could be home to watch every episode tons of action suspense science fiction etc br br story was of a boy who found an egg that hatched into a sea creature the same sea creature that had killed the main character's brother and the woman character had seen most people think it is a deadly killing machine but the one raised from the egg was very friendly br br only problem is nbc canceled it so now we'll never know what happens hopefully sci fi or some other channel will pick it up
<START> i finally snagged a copy of through netflix and spent new eve watching an amazing drama unfold it began with a winsome nandita das getting married to in the of sri lanka and then a war takes over their romance has to flee to india and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child several years later we see a playful well loved child p s who is the darling or burden of teachers parents and fellow schoolmates alike in a very how to solve a problem like maria sequence on her birthday she is told by her parents and indra that she is not their biological child she was adopted this tilts her confident love filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her several attempts at later the adoptive parents take her to sri lanka to try to find her birth mother the country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess but this also leads to their meeting the new one who finally is confronted by and asked why she abandoned her daughter br br the story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother the unconditional love of the adoptive parents the demons that drive the birth mother the normalcy of chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged sri lanka mani made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring ar music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film the film has excellent performances from nandita das and an absolute stunner role as the abandoned one done by the child artiste p s this performance won her a national award br br the cinematography is visual poetry each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot i am intrigued by the connection mani has with terrorism love and obsessions i think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding character was quite unique his passion and idealism did not make him selfish rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl his one liners were hilarious the mother played by was also quite multi dimensional she was idealistic loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids the shock angst and obsession of the child was outstandingly portrayed by p s her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking in fact the enigmatic characters were those of nandita das and her husband perhaps mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes it also kept him from being judgmental this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy br br is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama i rarely weep in the movies but this one left me moist eyed and a little this is a beautiful film a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film
<START> oops i hired this because i thought it was bitter harvest 1981 which was recommended after the appearance of the appalling patsy kensit i checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake ok it's watchable because the main characters are very sexy but the acting is awful stephen baldwin looks morose the whole time which is understandable considering his co star is patsy competing with liz hurley for the title of the most obviously useless actor on the screen
<START> i picked this film up from the local family video on sale for 1 50 which was probably the first sign it wasn't going to be good watching it with 2 friends neither of them even wanted to finish it because of how awful this movie is i strangely couldn't stop watching it but this film is definitely a textbook case of how not to make a movie br br the plot is simple enough and sounds great chuck norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind bars the serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to become reality once more serial murder norris roundhouse kicks this sounds like a great film br br and some of it is pretty good the flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense a scene where a van off a cliff and gets crushed is amazing and i learned how to break out of prison using nothing more than gun powder and dental floss but there is plenty wrong with this movie br br one the editor is a moron when making an action or suspense film you have to keep the energy moving there are far too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot left in this movie slowing it down and distracting from the overall story at least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pacing would have improved and the film would be slightly better two the sound guy is a moron apparently somebody tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get decent sound so most of the dialog is voiced over killing the stereo and not lining up with mouths also the music is far too dramatic in some scenes three the casting director is a moron they cast billy drago as a psychiatrist billy drago is a great cult actor from brisco county the hills have eyes and others and would have made the proper serial killer or some sort of villain his character is so vanilla that drago's skills are wasted four the writer is a moron two plots are in this film the hunting of a serial killer and the romance between norris and his pregnant girlfriend every time i saw that woman on screen i wanted to claw my eyes out and sure enough she never figured into the other plot making her story completely pointless br br will i ever watch this again maybe but unless they remaster this film at least a dozen times you never should not recommended
<START> first off i saw another reviewer said this movie was fantastic well nothing could be further from the truth this movie is complete garbage a moronic horror comedy that is not even slightly funny don't take that mean that it's so bad that it's good because it's not it's a total waste of time and money br br here's what i see in this waste of a dvd a group of friends get together on a weekend get drunk and then decide to make a backyard video they grab mom and dad's video camera and start coming up with scenes on the spot they all get a big kick out of watching themselves mug for the camera they figure if they think it's funny then everyone will think it's funny well they're wrong this backyard home video is garbage the acting and comedic gore effects are lousy but i guess that's to be expected since this is nothing more then a home video br br on the bright side i guess the fact that this crap got out there gives hope to anyone out there who wants to make a movie if these people could get their movie made and released on dvd then anyone can br br 0 10 save your money
<START> i just saw this film and i recommend it it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love tom character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering emily watson's character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything i won't say more because it is better for you have to enter the story as it unfolds
<START> this movie is a coveted member of my movie library while not a mainstream film it is in my view a highly effective film noir in which eric roberts is totally underrated as an actor i would qualify him as a much better actor than his sister julia who is overrated but that's another review roberts plays the down on his luck ex reporter with the perfect mix of narrative precision and jaded idealism two ingredients that are part and parcel of any effective film noir the first person narration by roberts enhances the quality of the movie and keeps us guessing on the real motive behind the crime br br set in palm springs everything about the setting in the movie progresses slowly as a metaphor for the theme of oppression roberts is oppressed by his past the police are oppressed by the rich residents of palm springs who treat them as servants the rich meanwhile are oppressed by boredom watch johnny depp's classic performance as the insightful rich kid who only wants to be loved the isolation of each character is omnipresent and is further augmented by the heat and isolation of the desert br br there is an audience for this film if they're looking for a more contemporary version of film noir while there are elements of the film that might have been tighter i recommend getting a copy of this film and putting it right between the big sleep and chinatown in your movie library the film is based on the arthur lyons book castles burning and if you like acting in this one you may want to get a copy of the ambulance in which he showcases his funnier lighter side best line in the film careful careful of what i should've asked only fools ignore the strange warnings of trailer park ladies
