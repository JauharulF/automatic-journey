<START> this movie was funny from start to finish everyone in the cinema was laughing out loud throughout the film the best characters were alex fisher jada pinkett edie cohen debra messing the girl from will and grace and tanya the manicurist debi they had the best lines the best attitudes etc jada pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny she really played it well and was very convincing the only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters weren't as funny even though the movie focused around them all in all this is a great movie to go and see with your girls yes guys it's a girlie movie through and through enjoy
<START> nbc was putting out a lot of good product when this series came out but none of it was getting viewers at least according to their executives who wisely canceled good shows like star trek my world welcome to it because of low ratings nbc's advertisers were getting a bargain from nbc's ignorance br br this show stands out as the only time james garner wasn't enough to get viewers it is ashame as this show had an excellent support cast from stuart margolin later angel in the rockford files to neva patterson to margot kidder br br it was set in a 1900 western town garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use violence to do his duties it was small town stuff but it was excellent it wasn't long after this that jim rockford brought garner back to success but for my money this show was good enough it just wasn't in the right time right place or given the right opportunity br br the show was so good that most of the folks who worked on it also got jobs on rockford
<START> the sad thing about frontline is that once you watch three or four episodes of it you really begin to understand that it is not far away from what happens in real life what is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny br br the frontline team in series one consists of brian thompson bruno lawrence a man who truly lives and dies merely by the ratings his show gets occasionally his stunts to achieve these ratings see him run in with his line producer emma thompson alison a woman who hasn't lost all her journalistic integrity and is prepared to defend moral scruples on occasions the same cannot be said of reporter brooke vandenberg jane kennedy a reporter who has had all the substance sucked out of her so much so that when interviewing ben elton she needs to be instructed to laugh her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities with whom she has or hasn't with before or scandalous unethical reports that usually backfire martin de mora is the reporter with whom the team relies on for gravitas and dignity as he has the smarts of 21 years of journalism behind him his doesn't have principles so much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story though he does draw the occasional line parading over this chaos in name is mike moore rob an egotistical naive reporter who can't see that he's only a pretty face for the grubby journalism he often finds his morals being compromised simply because brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest br br frontline is the sort of show that there needs to be more of because it shows that while in modern times happiness safety and deep political insight are interesting things it's much easier to rate with scandal fear and tabloid celebrities
<START> hey community my question is about the song the pizza man wants casey to play right after smoking that weed not his application song but the cozy one thanks br br this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing br br hey community my question is about the song the pizza man wants casey to play right after smoking that weed not his application song but the cozy one thanks br br this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing
<START> i only wish there was a grade lower than f to give it i scored it a 1 in the vote tally i am grading this not even as a regular film but as a t a film and this is the worst lamest crappiest and most awful movie i've seen the acting story and music are all terrible not to mention there isn't even any nudity for the t a it's about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him doing cheers avoid this piece of trash at all cost this is the worst of bad 80's teen cinema
<START> i wanted to like this movie but there is very little to like about it it starts out with jean stapleton and a randy newman song in iowa northwest iowa i guess reminiscent of norman cold turkey which was one of the best movies ever made according to people on imdb so far so good and the idea of the archangel michael living at pansy motel on earth well give it a chance it's supposed to be a comedy okay so far so good but michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had the other characters in the movie don't have much appeal either michael brings a dog back to life and we're supposed to be in awe of that the people make up corny country songs in the end stapleton dances with travolta big deal if she was smart she wouldn't even be in this movie when it was over i thought gee what a stupid tasteless boring corny sacrilegious movie it's not fit to be seen by children or anyone else
<START> i bought the dvd to get julia ormond well i got that in spades she was lovely in the romantic scenes too bad bill paxton was flying on autopilot for the whole effort i almost lost my lunch when he popped his big fat white behind out of his flight suit to shall we say with julia br br i realized julia was very proficient in french while watching her in 'sabrina' i watched 'sabrina' with the french soundtrack to see if julia dubbed her own dialog they used someone else in any case julia was chosen for this dutch film over a native french speaker with sufficient english to communicate with the american flier perhaps they wanted at least one familiar name for the british american market to my unfamiliar eye julia's features could pass for belgian br br the whole film had an odd nature it was a dutch film about belgium in world war 2 i would imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic dutch resistance to the german invaders the belgians were much more passive during the occupation period than were the french or norwegians the most savage fighting of all came in the balkans where tito's communist partisans gave the germans fits br br i noted in another review that believed julia ormond to be an american instead of the actual british nationality perhaps julia's acting skills were great enough to carry off that impression br br after watching this film several times it suddenly dawned on me how out of season the film is it is set on 16 1944 when the american plane crashes in belgian farm country the trees look to be in mid fall with lots of leaves and the weather is warm people walk about in light clothing and the grass is still green there is not the smallest trace of snow or ice this must have been the mildest winter in belgium ever br br the actual plot of the film was a mess where to begin for anyone interested in world war 2 history the film came across as farce the reconnaissance plane used was a huge 4 engine converted bomber such aircraft did exist but they would have required massive fighter escort to have any chance of survival in reality smaller and aircraft were readily available and would have been far more suitable for the task the vital code books in the film would never have been carried on the plane the crew had no need of this information to complete their mission while compromise of this information would have been a huge intelligence defeat even given the premise of the film the first items to be stripped from the aircraft would be the code books they would have been on their way to berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of german troops at the crash site br br the home where 'major took refuge was a farm where no one had the least interest in farming food would have been very scarce in belgium at this time the germans would have required substantial quantities of locally produced food to support their forces the family truck would have been long before the arrival of the american flier there would not have been any fuel available to run it anyway br br the plot twist where henri turns in the american out of jealousy is pathetic he would have had to reveal all he knew about the resistance in order to be allowed to live he would have had to function as a double agent to frustrate any effective opposition the woman with the secret radio would have never survived the war br br 'major was caught in civilian clothing toward the end of the film that made him a spy under the laws of war and liable for execution with no defense he would not have meekly surrendered to face interrogation unhindered by the geneva convention better to force them to kill him and spare his friends if possible br br i have not read the novel upon which this film is based if this film is a faithful adaption it shows an abysmal lack of development in the novel regardless of the novel the screenwriters could easily have produced a superior script that would not waste this opportunity to deliver a much better film
<START> someone commented that charlie sheen's character should be court martialed for doing whatever he wanted you may be right but that is how truly are i served for several months with a seal team out of norfolk va actually i should say they used our ship to deploy themselves around europe for a couple of months i was the postal clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we issued one pass to one person each day a different seal would come up pretending to be someone else well after the third time i said no to them until i had proof who they were they went nuts i thought they were gonna bust through my cage gag me and then steal the mail luckily i had not only the president on my side the navy but the federal government us mail that was the only time i saw the seals stopped from having whatever they wanted they were allowed unlimited shore leave where we had to be back on ship at a certain time they killed and tortured a woman in france and the two only got a 1 week detention on ship whereas a seamen was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a french wine shop and he got a court martial is it any wonder why the retention rate is over 85 as a seal you are god so this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a seal acts and thinks unfortunately it is so unbelievable to normal people that it comes off as being fake
<START> despite decades of tax incentives in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind most central african and islamic states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvelle france aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries' failures on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising there's certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canada's history as the french and english warred over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blink and you'll miss it scene of characters saying wolfe is dead or nouvelle france is no more before getting back to the soap but while this isn't a history lesson it isn't a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by a half dozen re and one collapsed shed the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors what you do get for your money is a simple but drawn out harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesn't turn up in the cast it's the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfall br br an anglo canadian french co production that doesn't so much unite once warring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew this massive box office disaster was clearly intended to be canada's titanic though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one can't even find the strength to mock it that's rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a below par 80s miniseries the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring you'll never see your handsome lover again honor you'll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and gasp witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moore's version of the scarlet letter throw in british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and you've got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetence br br leading man david la versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the clean shaven karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his father's death with an expression that looks like he's waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor who's lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isn't there billie piper lookalike leading lady doesn't exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying center stage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent corrupt and perverted le bigot that really is the character's name the duplicitous drunken lackey sebastien and saddest of all gerard depardieu's bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky grey haired wig it's a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like he's not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldn't be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the film's brief release br br some brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnett archie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roth's william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one who's being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaney's benjamin franklin they're both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette and bianca gervais as the heroine's real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better
<START> it's impossible to make a film based on such a book as the brothers by f m br br richard brooks is a great director but that film is on a very low level br br the worst part of the film was the ending well let's think of the book in the end we have the guilty karamazov afterwards they sent him to siberia in the end the famous of the friends and family making a plan to save him but that's it a nd now the film takes two steps more and shows us an illusion ending of the escape of and i think just from the moral point i'm sure that would finish the book with an open end because one the one hand he is not guilty is the real murderer and so he have to be a free man but on the other hand he goes to his father to kill him so he has decided to commit the crime that's a moral dilemma and so the following point is an open end well for real it's just not full open br br william shatner as karamazov i'm sorry no br br the others characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect it from such great actors in front of course a superb performance of yul as i think that there are not many actors who can play this part in a better way br br but as i said in the beginning this book is unadaptable it never should be film in two hours that's impossible i think that there are some films so maybe they could do the right thing but i just keep the opinion that this book can't be adapted br br so 3 points br br a point for the great director richard brooks br br a point for a superb performance of yul brynner br br finally a point for one of the greatest writers of all time
<START> when it was announced the king of pop was dead at age 50 a month before he was to start a series of live comeback shows at london's arena it was a huge shock to millions of people around the world he was and will forever be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry and he will be missed terribly i decided to remind myself how wonderful he was by watching what is considered by many to be not only jackson's best video and possibly song but the greatest music video ever made from director john landis an american werewolf in london the film opens with michael and his girl ola ray having their car breakdown and after giving her a ring the moon comes out and he turns into a werewolf we then see michael and his girl watching this horror film in the cinema she is scared and walks out and michael soon follows her singing the iconic song soon enough the voice of vincent price comes on and zombies start crawling out the earth and open coffins from the graveyard and michael and the girl are obviously surrounded she turns away and michael has become a zombie himself and with all the other creatures they do the iconic dance before he turns back into his normal self at least for the chorus the girl runs into the near creepy house blocks the doorway but zombie michael still manages to break through and when he touches her she screams to see normal michael say what's the problem the film ends with him taking her home and looking at us with evil eyes michael jackson was number 14 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons and he was number 6 on the ultimate pop star the thriller album was number 4 on the 100 greatest albums and this video was number 71 on the 100 greatest scary moments and it was number 1 on the 100 greatest pop videos very good
<START> spoilers ahead br br it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be br br such a disappointment i thought this was full of silly clichÃ©s and br br that it basically tried to hard br br to the american guys out there how many of you spend your br br time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey br br sounds to the married girls how many of you have suddenly br br gone from to overnight but not with your br br husband to the french would you really ask about someone br br being Ã  la when you know they don't speak french wouldn't br br you use a more common word like br br i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understand br br europe and i love it but my german roommate and i found this br br pretty insulting overall it looked like a movie funded by the br br european parliament and it tried too hard basically it had all br br sorts of differences that it tried to tie together not a bad thing in br br itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous too br br many clashes that wouldn't really happen then the end of the br br movie the last 10 minutes ruined all the rest why doesn't xavier br br talk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris why does br br he just walk off why does he just run away from his job is that br br freedom and in the end is the new europe supposed to rest on br br a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day is this what br br it's made up of br br besides the acting was pretty horrible i can't believe judith br br role and acting why was she made to look like br br emanuelle bÃ©art so much at first i thought xavier was ok but br br with retrospect i think he was pretty bad br br and that's all really too bad because technically opening credits br br scenes when he's asking what papers he needs it was really br br good except for sound editing around the british siblings and the br br soundtrack was great too so the form was good but the content br br pretty horrible
<START> surely the gershwin family realizes this is one of america's greatest opera you have thousands of fans of this opera waiting for it to be released on dvd please don't be so stubborn give us a break think of the joy and wonder you can bring to a starved public for quality music by releasing this great gem don't wait until the film is beyond repair the cast is first rate the music is just awesome we need beautiful music in today's world it may never be filmed again with such a great cast again with today's home theater systems wonderful sound systems and need for great music i'm pleading with the gershwin family to reconsider and release this awesome movie thanks so much
<START> honestly when i went to see this movie at the rave theater in indiana i did not expect much i went to this movie only because i figured hey it's a wwe movie it'll be good for a laugh then i sat down and watched it and saw why they chose glen jacobs kane to play jacob goodnight he is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen much worse in my opinion than freddy or jason and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie it shows jacob goodnight as someone who is human he has a heart no matter how twisted and creepy it is he feels pain something that jason never does or appears to show he feels sorrow and pleasure though again both of them insane which you will notice if you see the movie all in all a different experience in my opinion than many slashers and it surprised me in a few ways as in who lived in the end
<START> a man arrives in a strange beautiful sterile city where no one feels any emotion and obsesses instead about interior design the essential of his days is reminiscent of 'groundhog day' the strange passages in and out of this world more remind one of 'being john but truly this is a scandanavian movie a piece of self satire that is also scandanavian in style the tone is austere and even the most fantastic scenes are played straight daring you to laugh at the absurdity to my mind the combination isn't wholly successful there aren't enough genuine laughs to compensate for the difficulties of taking the piece as pure drama it certainly is original perhaps my problem is that the world that it is not one that i recognise perhaps i should move to
