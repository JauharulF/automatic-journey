<START> if like me you actively seek out the rarest and weirdest and often most awful that world cinema has to offer then you should look no further than the supernatural horror output of hong kong in the early 80s often mixing bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy and usually packed with plenty of creepy snakes worms eels etc these movies are about as bizarre as it gets br br is definitely a case in point featuring a mountain tribe whose women keep their men from straying by casting nasty spells over them that should they leave cause them to fill up with writhing creatures and die an agonising death some so so martial arts and lots of real life animal killing much of which is perpetrated by a geek who has absolutely no bearing on the story this film is just plain strange br br a prolonged scene in which the tribeswomen hunt for snakes and insects casually throwing the creatures into the baskets on their backs is quite fascinating a tribal feast that sees a poor ox bashed on the head and then torn apart is totally disgusting and the moments that show worms crawling in open wounds and being vomited onto the floor will have the squeamish losing their appetite for a while br br however it's the live animal munching that really qualifies for legendary status amongst fans of out there movie making it's thoroughly vile to watch and yet strangely compelling the geek chomps on a snake down a fat juicy toad nasty and hungrily devours a mouse biting off its head and then shoving the rest in afterwards br br not a great movie hell it's not really even a mediocre movie is recommended only to people who think they've seen it all this one gets 4 out of 10 from me which is probably more than it deserves but i begrudgingly respect it for being able to make me feel slightly ill
<START> i saw this film as a sneak preview before the venice opening at the film festival your reaction to it will largely depend on your attitude about respecting the text of shakespeare on the plus side pacino gives a very good performance indeed as shylock lynn collins is a fine and the film has a sumptuous look br br the negatives are predictable the merchant of venice is arguably the most difficult of all of shakespeare's plays to stage today largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of 20th century history the romantic plot with and presents no problem the character of shylock does because we lack the original frame of reference of the elizabethan audience shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations and an abstraction of the pitiless quality of the old law when he says hath not a jew eyes he is a character when he proclaims i will have my bond he is an abstraction the long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene here moved and cut to ribbons is the key to the play in that it re establishes universal harmony after the disruptive and evil the shylock of the trial scene forces are ejected it is possible to make psychological sense of the character of shylock by showing his gradually going mad and turning into a by the time the trial scene rolls around the key is that at a point he must cease being sympathetic br br pacino's performance almost does it but not quite the film can't quite make up its mind on the one hand there is the right movement in the character of shylock and on the other there is a great deal of extraneous footage of jews being abused and venetian whores with rouged nipples no doubt to show the decadence of antonio et al shakespeare was not writing an ibsen like social drama he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order symbolized by marriage with a theme of love versus law at the center of the shylock plot br br in this sense the film is a travesty surgery on the play and direction almost force us away from what the play really means taking the beginning of the final scene cutting most of it and moving it before the trial scene is the most extreme example there are some other significant difficulties jeremy irons a fine actor plays antonio as if he were overdosed on sedatives joseph fiennes is pretty but shallow as most of the actors with the exceptions of collins pacino and the actor playing the duke in the trial scene mumble their dialogue br br final verdict a pretty film with a few decent performances it's not shakespeare it's poor interpretation not really worth your time or money although lynn collins as almost redeems it
<START> my wife rented this movie and then conveniently never got to see it if i ever want to torture her i will make her watch this movie i've watched many movies with my 4 year old and i can take almost anything barney is refreshing after a shot of quigley br br the plot dialog cinematography acting were one step above or equal to a cheap porn film i feel cheated out of 3 69 that we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes of my life i will never get back i will say my 4 year old liked it luckily it was a rental we had to return right away br br i just hope that the younger actor's careers are not ruined from being in this movie
<START> i wanted to like this movie i really really did i was so excited when i saw the preview which scared the hell out of me but when i saw the actual film i was disappointed the acting is stilted and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced and i'm sorry but a boy being chased by a turd in a is not funny or scary it's just stupid i grew up on the bell witch legend so i know quite a bit about it a lot of facts in the movie are right on target but this film should have been much better the entire birthday party scene for example lasts about fifteen minutes adds nothing to the plot or the story and should have been left on the cutting room floor a more heavy handed editor might have been able to get a decent film out of this mess br br please understand i'm not in any way shape or form involved with the other bell witch movie and i'm not trying to attack this imdb listing i'm just telling it like it is
<START> i'll preface my review by stating that i am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's i don't own any i've never rented any so i might lack the appreciation for these tongue in cheek low budget stinkers that many other people have br br i caught this movie on cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend please don't ask me why i was watching cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend we were bored with world championship poker some atrociously bad acting courtesy of misty mundae and i wish she wouldn't own up to being from illinois as we actually turn out some very bright thespians here caught our attention now normally the aim of some good soft core porn would be to get you and your partner in the mood some good sex tongue in cheek humor and who know what could happen after about 15 minutes and a scene where the title character seduces a mugging victim my lady friend said 'if you want to watch the rest of this fine i am going to bed so i don't have to please turn the volume off ' here is what i gather from the plot misty's character is a sexless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super sex kitten with super web slinging powers that don't come from her wrists there is some sort of evil villainess involved who didn't look particularly evil or sexy spiderbabe saves the day has sex m j who is male in this film constantly gets propositioned by stereotypically bad gay bikers and somehow the evil villainess gets pushed off a building to her death br br what was good about this film it ended br br what was bad about it acting to make a third grade pageant look like oscar winners a script turned out by people who i picture to be drunken college aged sex perverts who wouldn't know what sex is if they took a class taught by dr ruth special effects that were about as special as someone jumping off a trampoline humor about as funny asÂ well i have yet to encounter anything that is lamer the sex scenes if we were watching a video the only thing those scenes would have turned on is the fast forward button and the action scenes some of my old atari games had better choreography br br now i know this type of film is supposed to be enjoyed for it's inherent badness companies like don't set out to make good movies they have a niche and they target it my experience as a tells me they are right on the money in their audience but after my brief exposure to i for one can say i am not delving into that world again any time soon maybe the problem with the filmmakers in this type of genre is this they spend so much attention to making the films bad that if they made an effort to try and focus on those things they do very well they would turn out some very enjoyable bad' cinema a la troma films in the 80's sorry folks the spirit is there but the effort isn't br br though i have to admit that alice in intrigues meÂ
<START> this is a new barbie movie the graphics were really good they made the movie seem partially realistic i used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it this movie was kind of like a cinderella movie but a little bit different a father of 12 princesses gets very sick his cousin poisons him and wants the throne the girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories its up to them to save their father and society with the help of their handsome prince it was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it we enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the indian talking parrot the music was very nice and made the movie even greater it had a great classical orchestra the voices were great and the characters were adorably sweet and cute i liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family all in all i'd watch it again
<START> nurse betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent unease inducing plot with extraordinary characters in the same way i loathed fargo on first viewing then realized i was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow i liked nurse betty a lot more the day after i saw it hard to understand harder to explain as others have said it's quite forced in many ways but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking br br fair job by greg kinnear great work from morgan freeman although i worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain chris rock was good but not a standout rene z is so natural it's unnerving i e unnerving to be natural playing someone not well in the head also liked the sort of abrasive sparkle performance from allison in a small part br br don't go expecting as much of a road movie as you might assume from some synopses there is road but it's only barely relevant rated 8 10
<START> wow as a big fan of larry western tales and the lonesome dove series in particular i was s o o o looking forward to comanche moon what a tremendous letdown maybe my expectations were set too high because of the all around excellence of lonesome dove the story the characters the cinematography the music it all worked br br comanche moon by comparison comes across like a bad saturday night live skit the characters are completely colorless the dialogue is babble and the plot meanders mindlessly all over the place it seems like the actors are all reading from teleprompters i couldn't relate to any of the characters good guys bad guys not even the incidental characters david performance stands out in particular it looks like it was plucked out of an eighth grade middle school performance i'm sorry i'd like to find something positive to say about comanche moon but i just can't do it there's nothing there
<START> with the plethora of repetitive and derivative sitcoms jamming fall summer winter and spring line ups it's nice to see a show that sets itself from the lot in more than one area br br takes an unusual approach it's not about the daily musings of an eccentric family zzzz nor about the other boring stuff you see everywhere in sitcoms the show is about this small time white trash thief earl who scratches off a lottery card and scores big time right at that moment took it away from him overtime he learns that that unusual incident was probably because of all the bad things he's been doing so he sets off on a mission to right every wrong he ever did and he's got all his deeds on a paper br br this is a brilliant premise for a sitcom thankfully it landed in the right hands the execution of the show produces extremely satisfactory results you get an innovative comedy that is genuinely funny and really touching at many times you can't help but fall in love with earl's sincerity and randy's simple mind good heart and observations on life wild flamboyant personality and mellow demeanor that really him to you very easily br br when you combine the show's innovation with its genuine humor good heart interesting characters and well written dialogue you really have a keeper with shows like this and the incomparable the office nbc is obviously on to something did they finally free a cubicle or two for quality assurance let's hope so and let's hope for more quality shows like these will occupy the line ups shows that'll make both us tv viewers and nbc executives stop crying over the long gone days of nbc's golden days frasier seinfeld friends
<START> ok i'm 26 so i've been thru all the action heroes 80's hype and chuck norris along with seagal van damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes fighting the bad guys shooting dozens of bullets from one round only i saw the advert of this movie on tv a couple of days ago chuck norris was throwing some fireballs from his fingers whoa 'that is a must see crappy movie ' i said and indeed it was only a lot lot worse it is very difficult to see all the movie stuffed with some religious thoughts ridiculous zombie like monsters who serve satan all the idea of a plot set in some forgotten community which represent whole mankind it is a load of christian wet dreams br br i've nothing against christianity even in the movies but this one lacks taste it lacks almost everything that connects with a common sense c'mon chuck norris playing an angel whose job is to look after little town where satan lives the whole plot is so damn straight and boring not mentioning its silliness yes it's not stupidity anymore we're talking silliness like like a retarded child's joke make altogether terrible movie made as far as i suppose for elder people very much devoted to catholic church because young viewers laugh at almost every scene technically it's incorrect the fx are worse than the ones you've seen in early 90's in tv series the plot seems very stupid actors could be easily exchanged to cardboard stands not mentioning the music which as far as i've heard was played on a childish toy piano i've seen a lot of movies even the worst ones the ones from the imdb bottom list like 'space or 'manos hands of fate' but believe me nothing compares to this ridiculous terrible horribly acted quasi movie which brings some students' prank movies to my mind rather than regular production avoid it at all cost avoid it there's even nothing to laugh at chuck norris has officially finished his movie career
<START> working girl kitty sothern is engaged to bill kelly who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage after being stood up on her birthday kitty goes on a double date blind date where she meets department store heir bob hamilton she falls in love but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress rather than his wife faithful bill rallies 'round to comfort her and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement pressured in part by bill's support of her family after she loses her job when bob returns however convinced that he wants marriage after all will kitty follow her heart or her conscience br br this film was a lot better than i'd expected it to be the character of bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic irishman type that jack carson played so often but kelly and the script infuse the character with real compassion and love and bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless the tone of the film wavers however between light hearted romance and a much darker side especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at bill's garage br br the cast is rounded out by the dependable jane darwell as kitty's mother an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious mickey rooney as kitty's younger brother and spencer charters as kitty's ne'er do well father
<START> wow i thought eskimo was the most awful and embarrassing first sex movie ever but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete in this case the well known german film producer was successful in producing even worse crap is stupid not believable and predictable and above all not funny it's almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany and i'm afraid also austria br br tobias 19 looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be 15 and his character is too dumb to be true tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn't know anything about sex but that doesn't help seems to be made by someone who watched al bundy and took him too seriously br br the best actors in the movie are sissi and stefan who play semi liberal parents and are stand up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting still their performances are the best' and in comparison br br a complete failure
<START> to start this movie was sick here your wife is dying and you go strutting around town with this blond chic by your side then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic hank james brolin is definitely moving fast throughout this movie i called him fast hank fast hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it she is having sex with his best friends the part that gets me is when she is doing it in the barn with kevin and gets caught by another one of hanks friends kevin gets up and leaves she drops her robe and bam right into the arms of this other guy and they start doing it right then and there i guess he is finishing up what kevin started how gross i am like this is lifetime movie its a typical old man young woman movie that says you can have my body if i get your money
<START> 2 glass shadow stars elias koteas as colton hicks rhymes with kicks a karate instructor who helps a cash jolie escape from her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company along the way billy drago and karen shepherd show up to the duo while jack palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run one of the things that is quite shocking about the cyborg franchise is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast the original had jean claude van damme and don't know her well she was in a bunch of 70's pornos this one has jack palance elias koteas billy drago and angelina jolie the third one has william katt zach galligan and malcom mcdowell okay so cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive i've never seen cyborg 3 but i did see this on sci fi channel and must admit i wasn't impressed actually strike that cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie it's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye however cyborg 1 was the same way indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye unfortunately like the first this one doesn't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture most of the ideas are taken from blade runner and max headroom so for various reasons the movie doesn't have much to offer beyond it's look another aspect is the terrible acting karen shepherd and billy drago are absolutely terrible and angelina jolie isn't much better elias koteas and jack palance come off fine but seriously palance is playing a cyborg warrior and koteas is a karate instructor i guess on the positive side you can't accuse michael schroeder of not being ambitious with casting still the movie is dull and i for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in also why did they tie it in with cyborg anyway it has nothing to do with it's predecessor which this manages to be worse than br br out of 4 bad
<START> for the most part michael is a disaster Â ten minutes of charm and ninety's worth of missteps br br travolta and macdowell do their best frequently rising above nora ephron's numbingly banal script but the film moves like a snail and even within its fantasy context the characters behave implausibly on a regular basis reporters who routinely let the story of a lifetime Â an apparent angel living on earth Â out of their sight br br someone forgot to tell romantic comedy maestro ephron that william hurt brilliant in so many other films is no tom hanks the movie's climax redefines the word contrived ephron may be shooting for heaven here but unfortunately michael is a long long ride through cinema heck
