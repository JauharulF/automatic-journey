<START> i don't know if this type of movie was as clichÃ© then as it seems to be now br br considering how many bad news bears films had already been released by 1980 however i think that this sort of movie was already a tired idea br br a former football player is partially paralyzed in vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair the chicago bears offer him a pr job but he wants to coach at the same time his underage nephew is picked up for armed robbery we are told that he has already been arrested over a dozen times before and he must now serve some hard time which turns out to be less than a year br br of course the kid is actually a good kid who only needs a tough male role model in his life the same goes for all of the kids in the detention facility yes even the one locked up for attempted murder i'm sure you already know what happens so i'll try and keep the rest of this brief br br our protagonist becomes the coach of the kids' football team he overcomes the cynicism and earns their respect his team faces off against a local high school team yeah right and they get their butts kicked now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach he demands a rematch will these underprivileged scrappy kids with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win the rematch awful execution of the football sequences ruins any possibility of excitement in this film coach of the year should get penalized for roughing my brain 1 10
<START> too predictable for spoilers but i'll not be cagey below so don't read it if you care br br a few dull scriptwriters together for half an afternoon and even then they run out of ideas so let's start with a criminal sought by all france doesn't matter what he has done we'll think of that later they don't some seconds of suspense but not too much and nothing unexpected because that requires art half an hour needed to finish off the film i get it have them rob a and take a lot of time avoiding alarms etc everybody robs jewellers in films just ike this it's bound to work it doesn't no humour no character ok yves montand does get to ham it a weeny bit and have everyone speak in a quiet deadpan voice that is supposed to make one think of noir but merely makes the actors sound depressed if they are silent it'll make them seem grimmer but also save us writing their lines we'd better add something for the stay at home women who are going to watch this stuff so let's have something to make them empathise with hubby we forgot to put any women in the film got it a son on gasp marijuana oh and have him attempt suicide for no particular reason shame his dad's a mafia boss for crying out loud but the audience will feel his fatherly care and if not sod them oh the crooked cop was a classmate of the guy who gets him in the end wrenching eh let's have them all die at the end or we'll never finish this stuff is it in the can right that's over with then thank god who'll we get for director
<START> when this show first came on the air i saw it once or twice and thought it was another fat guy skinny wife show that seemed to populate the networks at the time it was just okay upon initial viewings and i didn't watch it again however once it went into syndication i caught several episodes simply because it was on twice a night and i'm telling you the more you watch this show the funnier it is once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected this show makes you laugh out loud every new episode i watch is more creative than the one before people who only watch this a couple of times will not notice this the writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they appear at first this is far from according to jim first of all kevin james is hysterical incredibly charming and a talented comedic actor as is the supporting cast leah has excellent timing and patton spence is one of the funnier characters on the show and of course jerry stiller is brilliant as arthur i was shocked to read comments that he was the worst part of the show he's a gigantic part of why this show is so great his delivery of these ridiculous schemes rounding out the crazy dad character are beyond hilarious and the yelling the best episode is when they show him as a kid yelling lemon that episode during which carrie takes him to a therapist in hopes to get him medicated to make doug less stressed out guest star william hurt decides that arthur yells because he's never been validated the latter part of the episode where doug beats up his childhood self in a therapy session is beyond funny it's one of the most creative scenes i've seen on a sitcom i feel the strange need to defend this show because it is severely underrated while friends was sometimes amusing and raymond has some great episodes and characters they both lacked the creative touch that king of queens has in an era where most sitcoms have canned jokes and are on the whole mediocre king of queens continues to push the sitcom envelope and show real comic genius critics of this show obviously don't get it or haven't watched the show enough to give it a chance because anyone with real comic and creative sensibility has to laugh out loud while watching it's certainly on par with my other two favorites seinfeld and the office in its ridiculous tone it's the arthurs and michael scotts of tv that keep us watching and laughing out loud
<START> i just saw this movie i liked the soundtrack i saw first the trailer and was magnificent like all hollywood movies they know how to sell but the movie is almost awful first 30 minutes are interesting but then like almost all new movies they blow it up i don't get the idea why that kid died is a clichÃ© every movie must have a kid to be killed and everybody must become good after his death lol i don't understand what is the connection with the movie and is so predictable you know the end from the very first minutes nothing new in this movie i saw 'you got same idea but also something new this is something like but is not a little bit difference between them if you have no other option watch this movie but be sure is the last option you take and the choreography is worst than everything before this is not a must see for sure
<START> ouch what a mess we have here not so much of a mess as a painfully dull half assed excuse for exploitation brought to you by the one and only j g pat patterson yeah the same one from moonshine mountain doctor gore formerly known as the body shop is i guess somewhat inspired by frankenstein and god knows what else the late mr patterson also stars in this joke as a heartbroken scientist plastic surgeon who has recently lost his wife in a car accident and is driven insane from grief to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is to slaughter countless females then maybe rob a few graves for body parts in order to put together the perfect mate it won't be easy but thank goodness his pal gregg the hunchback is available to lend a hand and to offer moral support br br if proof was ever needed that some peoples goals are not meant to be accomplished here it is gang this patterson hayseed obviously never had any business directing anything much less following in the footsteps of good ol' h g as a master of gore i've never seen a gore movie that just flat out refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching even the gore is boring almost remotely humorous at times but impossible to tell whether it's intentional or not i pick not br br shot in north carolina home of the california axe massacre on most likely a 3 digit budget by a guy as untalented as he may have been who probably had an appreciation for drive in trash so maybe we should give good ol' j g a break i mean he tried i assume which is more that can be said for most and this movie is better than any of the big budget super hero garbage the theaters put out these days although i realize that isn't saying much besides doctor gore is quite the improvement over previous failure the chair so it's slightly possible he would have improved his craft in time had he not died so maybe it's not all that terrible especially compared to the other movie on the dvd how to make a doll so what the hell check it out 4 10
<START> but it's not the plot isn't all that bad the actors aren't all terrible so it should be decent instead though despite a good starting point the plot just drags on and suffers from a lot of those i can't believe he she is so dumb moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going it frustrated me at times watching some of the decision made by the lead character also it took way too long to get to the good part of the movie anticipation is great but you can't spend over half the movie building it up a shame too since it got decent exposure upon release and hit right before the big halloween season even so i have a feeling this is going to get at least one sequel if not more so maybe they'll be able to build on the strong general plot to eventually release something decent
<START> yes i couldn't stop yawning nor could my partner incredibly boring 90 minutes seemed to stretch to at least 3 hours and i'm not even a fan of action films but this just falls asleep on its feet unless you are a 70's polo neck sweater fan br br some spoilers follow if you were expecting anything to happen don't hold your breath it doesn't br br but seriously it totally fails to convince or involve the watcher it's like a long boring and rather disjointed dream frederic floats through it able to leave work whenever he wants and with attractive secretaries bringing tea and messages constantly obviously not real life and an office with virtually no paper or files just a giant calendar to let you know that the film really is taking 6 months to watch br br frederick never seems to be touched by any real emotion neither does his wife and the children behave like rag dolls in stark contrast to any real life even chloe despite her strong views never gives the appearance of really feeling anything the only 3 seconds of any real feeling occur between a couple overseen in a cafe and have nothing to do with the plot br br okay so maybe there are some moral considerations but if it's entertainment or even good cinematography you are looking for i think this film is incredibly over rated by most other viewers
<START> eliza elizabeth is a farm girl from the country coming to the city looking for love she has met a man that has told her of an astrologist who will show her the stars this is a journey of souls eliza is put to the test can she realize her true love when she sees him or not tommy tommy lee jones is a construction worker trying to find himself in his native heritage they show each other different ways of looking at things all the while eliza is still looking for love and tommy is trying to protect the reservation that his grandmother lives on this is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in the simple everyday things the style is artsy and chock full of symbolism the psychedelic camera styling might scare away the average moviegoer but the deeper message and the interesting frames make this movie worth watching it is a movie that explores the underworld of the weird wretched and devastated individuals this one strays from the path but certainly worth watching
<START> whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever and it's usually some movie that's cool to hate like manos the hands of fate or the avengers i ask them is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults does anyone utter the line 'i'd rather eat a in that movie br br this movie is way too infantile and moronic for adults and way too violent and irresponsible for children is there that much money in the beavis and butt head demographic to make a series of movies like this there is a problem child 3 but i haven't seen it i'd rather eat a turd
<START> hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film concerns about the known story of mckenna marriage james stewart doris day in the first version leslie banks edna best along with their 11 years old son travelling through morocco during vacations in a bus they know a sympathetic french person daniel in the old version pierre fresnay while they are in they also know a couple bernard miles and brenda de and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing the dying whispers a political message then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and mckenna gets help to inspector buchanan ralph truman br br this is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they're forced into action is excellently played by james stewart and doris day this exciting film displays suspense intrigue tension and interesting drama well written by john michael hayes and charles bennett packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician innocent people become caught up in a cobweb intrigue and uncanny intelligent villains colorful and glimmer cinematography shot in morocco and london studios by cameraman robert though with excessive transparency for scenes lavish sets by henry hitchcock's usual and working until his recent death of course the highlights are the happenings of the famous royal albert hall of london assassination where a sneering killer reggie tries to execute while composer bernard herrmann is conducting orchestra besides at the climax doris day singing sera que meantime her son suffering risks the song won oscar for ray evans jay livingstone the story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining rating better than average hitchcock's enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it
<START> terrific little film that stars mary astor as a go getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company but when the owner has to sell for health reasons she comes up with a scheme for the employees to buy the company with a jerk salesman robert ames as the front even though she is the brains br br of course he becomes a big success and she becomes his executive secretary basically still running everything and teaching him class she loves the dope but he never catches on as he fools around with a string of bimbos she is chased by a married but separated man ricardo cortez who isn't free but when a society gal catches ames everything goes to hell br br astor is just wonderful as the too smart woman who almost makes a huge mistake after she loses her man ames is good as the jerk but what does she see in him and cortez is good but doesn't have much to do kitty kelly is good as the sidekick dolores charles sellon is the original owner dale owen is the society babe and edna murphy is funny as daisy br br worth a look
<START> with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison chen nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywood style vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chan br br sure the kung fu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettable br br but for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better
<START> this movie is hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another giant cgi versions of these beasts which battle however i do require one of the guns used in the movie because apparently they are using cheats count the amount of shots they use before having to oh wait that's right they never have to reload regardless count the shots it's hilarious br br the sound effects used in the movie for the komodo vary from a tiger to an elephant oh and did i forget to mention that apparently these giant komodo dragons are stealthy as hell because somehow even when the actors are looking in the direction that the beast comes from they are surprised when it appears br br whenever someone dies you can tell its coming because they all brace for it they put their arms up in the air and cross them to save themselves it never works br br the final gem is that these script writers brains are just a gland full o' knowledge with facts such as both of these creatures being amphibious to comments such as helpless animals they are just full of fun facts
<START> lives upstairs is a very bad movie in my world history class our teacher had us watch this movie and amadeus to be able to compare the two composers or something we watched amadeus first and it was a very good movie but when she had us watch this movie directly after that i couldn't believe what i was seeing the acting was horrific the costumes were ugly the little boy's was especially ugly and girlish and the cinematography was z grade my friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the bottom right corner i understand this was a t v movie from canada and probably cost 10 to make but please they could have done better i have seen a few good t v movies in my time but this was not one of them the biggest thing that i don't understand is why my world history class couldn't just watch immortal beloved or something how is it possible to compare composers when given the movie amadeus for mozart and lives upstairs for it's not possible to do that when this is the choice of movie for i give amadeus an a 9 out of 10 if anyone cares to know but lives upstairs gets an f 1 out of 10
<START> i cannot believe it has been 25 yrs since i first watched this story on tv i remembered to have been very much touched by it and was lucky to get the vhs tape several years ago i did not watch it again until just recently i have been watched it over and over ever since i must have watched it 10 times in the past 2 br br the acting is superb the story is compelling and i am embarrassed to say that i did not appreciate actor bryan brown's talent until now the playful facial expressions shown in the first half when he gave jean the stolen medicine in is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous body languages shown in the second half in their first drink together in and the touring of the homestead we have to wait until the wedding reception especially the final dance scene to see his open display of affection for jean the same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in who wouldn't want to be his mrs br br while joe changed from a cocky almost bigger than life figure in the jungle to a somewhat self conscious average joe in his own backyard jean took the opposite road her wartime experience seems to have given her new confidence she wasted no time and went after what she wanted she took steps to take what she could get exactly as joe had told her to once upon a time br br for me all these transformations helps to show this is more than just a love story this is a story about growth courage and fragility in life the solicitor noel is both a sweet and sad figure he too gave much to jean he gave his last hope for love at the end he did what true love requires he put her happiness ahead of his own br br i happened to like the fight between joe jean that was not in the book i thought it's an appropriate and necessary addition for it helped to surface the inner struggles they both had to deal with in order to make their life together possible br br now i am older maybe i understand life love and loss a little better this story touches me even deeper br br i am however surprised to see b brown has blue eyes in the promo photo shown on this site he most definitely did not in a town like alice well 25 yrs is a long time
