<START> perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself what i want to point out here is that distant is not only an art house film but one of the best art house films from all the art house films i have seen distant is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold it is even fair to say that this film's cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass tarkovsky's nostalgia one commentator got it right that sex a jaded common feature among foreign films is surprisingly lacking in distant and in a good way what is most remarkable about distant is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world fortunately distant doesn't have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings
<START> i have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded a subject which could have been thought provoking and shed light on a reversed double standard failed miserably br br rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control the scenes here were for the most part pathetic it would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed and the victim's laugh with the cops when he aborted his police complaint seemed as genuine as that of the cops no awkwardness no to merely join in i don't know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely as for his half a ed supposed search for his attackers pathetic they should have skipped most of the sex scenes another monumental failure in themselves and had him meet colin friels when he first went to the police the story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback and saved by the superior acting and presence colin friels the only reason i watched this movie brings to any project he does br br the only concrete revelation of this movie is it was crap
<START> ok so i admit that it often seems like most of the sylvester tweety pairings have exactly the same plot sylvester tries to get tweety but repeatedly fails and always gets maimed in the process often with the help of a bulldog i guess that it's sort of like wile e coyote chasing road runner in other words mammals should never go after birds all a r r rd has the same plot and sets it on a train in a way the best part of these cartoons is seeing what sorts of schemes sylvester comes up with to try and go after tweety we know that he's going to fail miserably but it's also funny to watch tweety turn into a bad ass if you've seen his really early cartoons you'll see that he was not cute at all but in fact had a cruel streak this one mainly works as a way to pass time br br by the way i thought that i saw i mean i taut i sylvester pass a piece of baggage with the name friz freleng on it
<START> my curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film which now has been released on dvd for the first time in the uk has been more than rewarded peter has excelled himself in his audacity and technical skills this pseudo documentary is certainly ahead of its time and still frighteningly relevant and up to date br br the film is inspired by the upheaval of the late sixties in the us when the government has increased its use of violence and oppression while the anti war movement reacts increasingly violent and radical in order to deal with both this the overpopulation of prisons and to provide special training to riot police units the government has introduced the so called punishment parks convicted 'criminals' mostly activists are given the to either be locked up in prison for years and years or spend three days in one of these parks where they either gain their freedom their death or an even longer prison sentence the situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations however it reminded me of a sort of realistic version of battle royale 2000 br br the film's structure is extremely effective and recalls parallels with cannibal holocaust which is made almost 10 years later both movies are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged in thinking and feeling he is actually watching a real documentary and therefore shocked even though aware of the fact that this is a film both confront us with the inherently violent nature of mankind but where cannibal holocaust is devoid of any deeper meaning above all it is an exploitation movie in every sense of the word and does not raise any critical questions about the state of the world punishment park does just that br br i have been profoundly impressed with punishment park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long maybe that says enough about the truth of its content about the way power structures in this world function i do not agree with the critique that polarizes and stereotypes because the movie depicts activists and the keepers of the power structures who are in reality as polarized as they are here if they weren't there would not be any conflict and therefore no change in our societies in reality confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms whether you place them between activists and establishment in latin america russia or new york city if these groups would not be polarized to these extremes the activists would be part of the silent that tacitly complain but at the same time reside in the injustices of the world br br as peter tells us in the introduction on the dvd the actors in punishment park are for the most part amateurs most kids were real activists from la most policemen had been part of the national forces and even some of the members of the are part of the social and political establishment of the time not introducing both groups previous to the shooting of the scenes taking place in the improvised court room adds to spontaneous and improvised feel parallels are drawn with issues of the time such as the repression of black panther members one of the black prisoners is said to resemble the convicted charismatic bobby and the trial of the chicago seven br br i admire watkins' obvious and sincere engagement with injustice and his concern with human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments nowadays in the name of the war in terror to silence those that do not agree and refuse to be brainwashed punishment park remains to be an extremely important movie that should be shown in schools and seen by everybody who shares these concerns maybe its marginalization can finally be made up for
<START> there is something about doug appearance in a movie that is a of wretchedness his initials are like a special cinema certification that comes somewhere before 'u' br br cushing on the other hand seemed to both a dilatory agent and poor judgement of his own he did excellent work in the hammer movies as dr van helsing seen him do a very passable sherlock holmes in 'hound of the and his magnum opus was probably grand tarkin in the first 'star wars' the only man but the emperor who could tell darth vadar to 'stop and get away with it but crikey he's done some turkeys there was that lamentable movie for one and here's another br br there's a machine that's been hijacked from tracy island it's a cylinder with a screw at the front and traction devices at the sides i'm surprised jerry anderson didn't sue for plagiarism maybe he was bought off yet if the movie is any guide they can't have paid him much br br it's 1976 and we're still playing about in latex romper suits br br that's about it really some movies have an entertainment value in the 'so bad it's good' category this one doesn't even manage that it wouldn't even entertain kids stuff from the 1930's has got more going for it
<START> pity the monkees people always accused them of being manufactured which they were or being nothing more than a american knock off of the beatles again which they were but to the kids of the time they were real they were important they were legitimate discussions about who were better the monkees or the beatles were common on school yards but the critics well they never quite bought into it despite recording some very catchy classic pop tunes the did not receive much respect for their albums sadly a similar fate was met by their one movie vehicle despite the fact that it stands as the best band film ever beatle fans may argue that hard days night was better and i am sure that many of the kids think 8 mile was superior but none of these films were as daring and inventive as head and that is probably why it failed br br if head had told a direct a to b type story perhaps it would have appealed to the bands young fans but by pushing the envelope and using the movie opportunity to mock their own image they really sabotaged the film with their fans could you imagine eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best selling guy in a genre in which only 5 and i am being generous of the acts are white if you can picture that than you have an idea how daring it was for the to sing hey hey we are the monkees you know we like to please a manufactured image with no philosophy when you have a film in which frank zappa tells davy that he should focus less on the dancing and more on the music its clear that there is a lot more going on then you expected br br the story what there is concerns the boys trying to flee their manager who at one point forces them to play in a commercial but every time they run away they end up inside a box i don't think you need to be fellini to figure out the symbolism of that bit some neat little comedy bits follow with davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dive in the big match and peter refusing to throw away a ice cream cone he does not want because there are starving children so its wrong to waste food but the real selling point to this film is the music and its some of the best the band ever recorded even if you are put off by the story you can sit back and enjoy some terrific music br br any film that begins and ends with mickey attempting suicide by jumping off a bridge at the end the band follows him is never going to be a mainstream classic but if you are a fan of either the band or experimental cinema of the era than you will enjoy this film
<START> i wasn't expecting to much of this movie when i went into the theater but i had been waiting for it for many years to sum it up it was pretty damn good chad michael murray was pretty good i thought he was going to be another chris flynn from wrong turn but i was wrong elisha cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to brian van holt he played the bad guy too well i mean he was sick sadistic and very cruel the back story between the brothers was good plus i liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film it gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die jon abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best bud of cmm i liked how chad kind of cried when he found him dead it was better then just him being like whatever my buddy is dead who cares it showed how he really cared so overall this was a darn god slasher with some great effects bravo
<START> i am a huge robert taylor fan and i have been trying to find all of his films this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the u s would order a navy lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers and report only to the president that it made it hard to appreciate anything else about the film the death row scenes were entirely unmoving the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing she got better later in ball of fire thank heavens
<START> ah the classic genre of 80s sex comedies this is set on two beaches one a nude beach featuring myriad fully unclothed women the plot something about a bunch of attempting to get laid the usual fans of gratuitous t a and p should hunt this one down
<START> this film must have done well in the box office in order to give gator the budget it deserves this film had no budget needed a script rewrite and a better ending there is flashes of brilliance in this movie the boat ride scene burt driving the mean machine and his chat with his parents you can tell burt is a southerner and not a actor this movie shows what gator would be like burt's best film too bad this film did not have the same funding and was done on the rush 4 10
<START> i knew this was headed for disaster after looking at the clock within 7 minutes of air time the story line two people get married they move into the wife's parents home and husband doesn't get along with father in law and if you haven't seen this plot before you probably have not watched tv for the last 15 years or so
<START> i just want to comment to the woman above that the movie does credit beethoven in the begging in the beginning credits they show it thank you i think this is an amazing movie they picked just the right music for the mood of the movie the animation is wonderful and they picked the voices for the characters very well it teaches children to never give up and to always have hope princess doesn't give up and it shows children that they can do the same the movie also has humor in in for all ages parents and children to laugh at the colors in this movie are great and kids can really feel good while they are watching it i watched this movie for the first time now i am a huge fan and i'm sure your child will be too walmart sells tons of barbie and the magic of pegasus stuff so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they aren't watching it thank you
<START> haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks west point will really amount to something now that he has arrived haines displays his easy goofy comic persona as he takes on west point and joan crawford the local beauty great fun for the first half and amazingly touching after haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets the new humility filled haines get s minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against navy and despite a broken arm wins the game great rousing entertainment by mgm in this haines formula film shows billy at his best william bakewell also scores as the skinny follower the handsome but goony character would be played by clark gable cary grant gary cooper and others in later decades another take on the beautiful but daffy dames played by carole lombard and marion davies west point is a winner
<START> i have to admit that i had low expectations for this movie but i was surprised to find it entertaining interesting and funny it's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film there were moments that made my hairs stand up even better though were the highly amusing occasionally hysterical comedic moments in the film you'll know which ones i'm talking about there also are a few great special effects and the humor and the special effects aren't necessarily separate br br the acting on the whole is very good way better than a typical low budget horror film the lead jackie in particular and many of the smaller supporting roles like the lawyer the couple living next door the pizza man are well acted if they hadn't been the film wouldn't have kept my interest and i would have lost my belief in the story this is a good interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental
<START> ah man this movie was funny as hell yet strange i like how they kept the shakespearian language in this movie it just felt ironic because of how idiotic the movie really was this movie has got to be one of troma's best movies highly recommended for some senseless fun
