<START> i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance i really hope norton did not do this he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie br br i found it entertaining it wasn't mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects but it was not a bad it was fun to watch but yea definitely not a bad horrible movie br br 7 10
<START> when i first bought this movie i had my doubts about it even though the cast was pretty impressive but after seeing it i really do not regret spending the money in fact i'd love to spend it again and again and again on movies like this an absurd combination of humor drama thrill and the big questions this is exactly what makes it a great movie okay some might not enjoy what they see and some might even turn it off after a little while your loss it's got a wonderful way of dealing with the issues we've all been through in one way or the other and the characters you think you won't enjoy the company of throughout the movie turns out to be the ones you really come to love after a short while for anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor and living watch this movie i promise you you won't be disappointed
<START> i recently watched this movie because i'm a big kinski fan but oh my god don't get me wrong i love this guy but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work but fortunately he isn't the only one to blame first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit that's all all the dialogs and characters are so bad it's making you scream but maybe that's the fun of it all if you know the kinski biography it's obvious that kinski didn't care about those movies at all especially all his italo western roles he just took the money and that was it again this whole movie is totally weird only for hardcore fans of the genre
<START> i was duped into watching this by the many friendly reviews here boy are they way off mark to give this 9 to 10 points and call it one of the best movies of the is just unjustifiable the big problem here is lack of pace and a paper thin plot it's like slapstick on prozac everything trundles along predictably and listlessly the plot is weak to begin with two garbage men peep on their foxy neighbour witness a murder and unravel a waste disposal conspiracy and the movie never manages to go much further there are some amusing situations and decent acting but that's not anywhere near enough to save this jalopy of a movie br br it's simply a comedy that doesn't get its fat ass off the ground so why waste your time
<START> this film is right up there with the oscar and moment by moment as one of unintentionally funny films of all time br br it is worth the rental for a some wildly great br br the story is absolutely ludicrous nothing in life would happen like this it's so completely unbelievable the way james woods tries and hustle heavy hitters than they give this supposed two bit hustler a job 3000 miles away in la what a joke br br i love the old beat vw bug to signify how low they've gotten in life because of all the br br sean young is as unbelievably bad as the i'll love you forever no matter what wife you'll ever see if it wasn't so funny you would throw up at how sugary sweet young tries to project herself and as bad acting as you'll ever see br br james wood overacts throughout the whole movie and he's so extremely funny and is way way over the top it's just not to be believed woods seems like a parody of a cocaine fiend off saturday night live but watching woods on is worth the price of the rental br br i love it when woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more that he doesn't do that stuff anymore right before that woods just did three giant lines of coke br br this is some very funny stuff br br the ending is so comical but right on par with the rest of the movie
<START> one of the most magnificent movies ever made the acting of charles later known as bronson is simply outstanding this is the crown on the career of director winner who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece the plot has been copied many times but it's never been topped j moore the gun manufacturer many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to and rightly so this is not just a movie this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate although this movie has never been fully appreciated in the usa it has found a huge following in europe and asia where the movie is regularly shown at film schools and it is still a popular hit in student cinemas all across europe all in all a true classic
<START> sometimes full moon makes entertaining movies this isn't one of them full moon is like a low key troma their movies aren't as violent or off the wall but they're usually just as devoid of talent the acting in this movie isn't terrible but the script is pretty bad and overall it's pretty boring and it doesn't even contain any nudity like many full moon movies to somewhat redeem it skip this one and go rent head of the family
<START> i gave it a seven only because the acting is good and of course by that i mean wilkinson the other two principals were decent but the characters themselves what on earth was so bad about the character wilkinson played james manning i didn't see him behaving like the martinet emily watson accused him of being bill on the other hand was an insufferable jerk who i was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise who was i kidding tom wilkinson isn't paul bettany after all so what on earth did emily watson's anne character see in him she herself admitted he was pretty much a piece of offal in his treatment of her why would she even want to be in the same town as him to say nothing of the same room br br i noticed some other reviews one person said she cried at the end to witness james' tragedy what tragedy what you mean losing an imbecile who finds someone like bill amusing give us a break
<START> burt reynolds stars as an undercover cop who is after a crime boss rachel ward as the high price call girl he falls for burt does well in this role and i think he would've done well in more roles like this br br rachel ward is beautiful and sexy in her part good pacing and story but something is missing in the equation on a scale of one to ten 7
<START> this movie is truly amazing over the years i have acquired a taste for japanese monster movies and am well aware that early examples of this genre can be poor however this one reaches a new low as it follows the adventures of johnny a young boy who controls a giant robot and his fight against the evil gargoyle gang who seem to have an endless supply of horrid giant monsters at their disposal
<START> susie q is an original and isn't like those other bad disney film spoiler a boy named zach moves to a new town and has trouble at school he is good basketball a girl in the 1950's died with her boyfriend when their car was crashed off a bridge susie amy jo johnson from the power rangers pink ranger is helping zach as a ghost to get a necklace along the way he must explain to his sister about her ghost and finally getting this necklace susie returns to the bridge she died on and then she gets in the ghostly car of her boyfriend and they float up later as he misses her he finds a girl who looks just like her do you believe in reincarnation susie q is a good movie to see now and then but they barely give because disney needs to fill everything up with stupid movies and shows i give it a br br 7 10
<START> i made a promise that if ever i posted a comment that was less than complimentary then later felt different about it i would return and make known my change of heart so far this is the first time it's happened br br i'm really starting to enjoy hack something has clearly changed the storylines seem to be much stronger the plot may still be a tad surreal but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven i attribute this to fine acting br br not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner some need time to pick up speed i'm glad i kept watching this program and i really hope it lasts
<START> based on the elmore leonard novel of the same name killshot suffers from a lack of focus direction and creativity Â all elements which the original story likely had and negative test screenings forced severe edits including the complete of a character resulting in a film that feels almost nothing like a leonard story far too many characters populate a storyline too simplistic and straightforward not a typical trait of the author's work and the focus continually switches between two hit men who are difficult to like and a troubled couple who don't command our sympathy while the story itself provides precious few twists and turns sadly by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery br br washed up hit man armand the blackbird mickey rourke follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently sours his latest assignment now on the run from his former employer he haphazardly joins forces with inept misfit criminal richie nix joseph gordon levitt to gain some quick cash by extorting a wealthy realtor when struggling couple carmen and wayne diane lane and thomas jane are privy to the thieves' blundered plot they are forced into hiding as the crazed killers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses br br killshot proves that being based on an elmore leonard novel isn't grounds for immediate success or even a promising adaptation the characters situations and even resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly hint at something more it's not that there wasn't potential especially when rourke's black garbed calm and collected assassin perfectly executes a hit during the opening scene Â purpose and principals are just continually abandoned as each minute ticks away the style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing visually the roles of bird and even wayne are fleshed out befittingly giving immediate interest and depth to personas that typically end in a creative impasse br br the pairing of the cold and calculating black bird with the irrational and explosive richie is an enticing combination comparisons to fargo would be extravagantly too kind except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that kept them initially interesting as richie starts picking up the more experienced killer's habits bird loosens his grip on his own methods of murder regardless of what he sees in his momentary lighthearted fling with donna rosario dawson it's hard to imagine that his final confrontation with panicky carmen would provoke a confession of his true nature and subsequent carelessness that drastically affects his outcome likely or not this is unfortunate downfall Â and little entertainment can be garnered from these characters who steadily lose their originality by continually contradicting the habits that once made them intriguing br br the twins
<START> this 3 hour epic seems much shorter explores the will to power and conquest and the conflicting motives that underlie that quest by tracking two parallel lives the emperor whose desire to unify the chinese feudal states has its basis in noble aims but devolves into violent oppression isolation and ultimate powerlessness and the assassin jing ke a mercenary killer who comes to recognize the unintended consequences of murder and finds a form of salvation as with all great art this can be understood on many levels the movie evoked for me images and ideas from homer euripides machiavelli shakespeare and freud br br the story itself is true i checked it out at britannica com so this film will appeal to history buffs it's ironic that spent much of his last years in a futile quest for immortality not shown on the screen but consistent with the plot br br the movie can also be viewed as an allegory of and the cultural revolution through the movie one can understand that the last 50 years of chinese history have had their precedent in the last 3000 br br fortunately for the audience these complex ideas are developed in a film that is rich in imagery action and pagent the battle scenes alone are worth the price of admission
<START> un gatto nel cat in the brain is one of the goriest horror movies ever made there is a lot of blood and gore including chainsaw butchery bloody stabbings and numerous decapitations the film is also interesting as self parody of fulci but the gore and violence is the key element in it some of the gore fx were taken from own fulci's movies alice lo and i di both 1988 plus gore fx taken from fulci supervised the snake house aka bloody psycho by massacre by andrea bianchi non paura della marta by mario bianchi non si sevizia i bambini by giovanni and luna di sangue aka dalla morte by enzo all 1989 the scene where brett halsey beats the woman's face to pulp is from alice lo a film fulci had made for italian tv in 1988 the of the female corpse at the beginning is taken from the same film as is the head in the microwave and the guy that gets driven over and over again highly recommended especially if you like extreme cinema
