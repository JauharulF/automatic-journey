<START> i caught this movie on the sci fi channel recently it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b list horror suspense films go two guys one naive and one loud mouthed a take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky make shift tank truck hybrid decides to play cat and mouse with them things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously hitchhiker what makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie unlike so many others the two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase suspense scenes nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror slasher buff definitely worth checking out
<START> dakota incident is a curiosity for several reasons it will be obvious from the start that it was made long before anyone ever thought of political correctness although the ward bond character softens the edge with maybe we can communicate with them after all they're humans too type of dialogue his part stands side by side with the preacher to communicate with the martians in war of the worlds in fact it's uncanny the title is curious too use of the word incident contributes an importance and sophistication to the film that probably didn't hurt the contrived assortment of characters and linda fancy dress and hat are wonderful dated touches that make dakota incident a cool western artifact from the mid fifties
<START> goof factual error br br when charlie walks out of the room to commit suicide he takes his gun with a silencer after a few seconds we hear a loud bang from the same gun being fired
<START> i'm sorry but i can't agree that this was a good movie yes it looked good visually but it's the story that drives the movie and i must say the story sucked big time how in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot holes past the critics better story and i would've gave it a higher vote but i was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself i have always been a fan of scary movies and the previews really had me fooled all the scary scenes were shown in the previews and why did the family that got killed stay to haunt the house why did the father come back again why did he decide to kill in the first place why were the kids the only ones to see the ghosts first to many questions not enough answers if i could've gave it a zero i would've
<START> walt disney's 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself he died in late 1966 and is not generally considered to be among their very best output the main problem is that on the surface the film seems merely to be the feline version of either lady and the tramp 1955 or 101 dalmations 1961 both of which are certainly more beloved by fans even so being both an animation and cat lover i dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat voiced by eva gabor and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of paris by a wealthy lady hermione baddeley 's greedy butler luckily they meet a streetwise alley cat phil harris who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band led by scatman crothers and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs meanwhile at home edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets legendary entertainer maurice chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song which includes a verse in french and band indulge in a breezy number wants to be a cat
<START> rarely have i seen a work of literature translated so badly to the screen the hysterical cast of b movie and sitcom extras simply make the characters seem like bad jewish stereotypes the worst of all is melissa gilbert who you hate from scene one and never develop any sympathy for performances like this should be noted and used against actors who wish to work again all in all a seedy low budget made for tv film of the sort that gives made for tv films a bad name
<START> br br crackerjack starring mick malloy judith lucy both part of the cast in the early 90's saturday night comedy show the late show bill hunter an australian movie icon and john clarke who we still see regularly on australian tv along side brian br br crackerjack is about a guy in his early 30's jack simpson played by mick malloy who pays his yearly at the local bowls club in order to get a few car park spaces for which he uses himself and rents out to others as cheap inner city parking br br the club falls on hard times and pulls all the resources and together it can jack gets a phone call telling him to turn up to next bowls match or lose his membership and his car park space br br i wont spoil the rest but the film is funny light hearted and contains everything a good aussie film should br br if your not australian then some of the jokes and humour will no doubt baffle you if you are an aussie do yourself a favor and sit yourself down to crackerjack its now available on dvd i already have my copy br br 10 10 awesome flick br br
<START> br br very dull laborious adaptation of amis's amusing satire the hero is portrayed not as a likeable loser but a merely oafish cretin most of the rest are pure caricatures with only helen putting in real quality and providing something of the novel's wit the period setting is camped up as if it were the 1920s not the post war period of horror comics and roll a real dud even by the standards of bad uk tv br br
<START> just watched for the first time although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances as an educator seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer not just the lessons found in textbooks is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded the thread concerning the vietnam war rings true even today well worth a look
<START> why do the powers that be continue to cast jennifer lopez in unbelievable roles she was excellent in selena and pretty good in money train which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself however roles like this just draw the line i could never see lopez as an fbi agent see out of sight for that unremarkable performance but as a psychotherapist give me a break br br basically lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues when she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind br br lopez's acting here is typically below average i can't get over that high pitched squeak of a voice she has she's no julia roberts but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field well she's not even in the same stadium sure she is a very sexy lady however that isn't going to carry a film and it certainly doesn't carry this one with anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character br br having said all that this film is visually stunning the colors are fabulous and the story line isn't half bad in a b movie kind of way the audio here is superb as well this movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline and major points for how it looks and sounds unfortunately the acting and poor casting bring it down a few notches br br my rating 6 10
<START> we have moved far beyond this tentative foray into a forbidden area drug addiction for the 1950s as such the film may seem dated the man with the golden arm served its function is peeling back a layer of the underside of society an eye opener to a southern country boy in 1955 when i first viewed this film in the theater after some serious consideration about being too young i was allowed to go it was powerful and affecting then and still maintains some sharp painful moments of the soul stripped naked as a movie depicting the loneliness at the core of being it succeeds br br filled with angst frank sinatra in his best role creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer he conveys his helplessness and in a beautifully restrained performance as a voice of common sense in the dead end urban jungle kim novak as molly is quite good she is compassionate and yet stands on solid ground the interaction between sinatra and novak is really good darren mcgavin plays a slimy character and does it very well eleanor parker is superbly irritating and painfully insecure in her role of the pathetic the crippled wife of sinatra arnold is another unlikely survivor of the street regarded as pitiful and despicable his character sparrow provides tart comedic moments br br the music is almost the star of this film brooding frenetic moody poignant elmer bernstein's score perfectly accentuates the tensions of frankie spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin molly's theme is bittersweet and captures aurally what the film depicts visually i know of no other soundtrack that effectively complements the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as does this one
<START> i have been looking forward to the release of this dvd and it's follow up female prisoner scorpion grudge song for some time i very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series after just watching this film i would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three br br all three of these movies were directed by ito what is great about them though is that even though they all feature the same lead character wonderfully played by they are each vastly different from the others br br the first movie female prisoner 701 scorpion is more or less a typical women in prison movie but the character of scorpion is very intriguing very reminiscent of the anti heroes of many spaghetti westerns and the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material br br the second movie female convict scorpion jailhouse 41 is a real tour de force not so much a wip movie as the bulk of the film has scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the lam br br this movie female prisoner scorpion beast stable is the third in the series and the last one directed by ito this one plays out as much more of a crime drama once again our heroine is on the run but this time out she has managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life relatively speaking anyway she gets a job she finds a place to live she makes a friend on the outside but of course everything has to unravel eventually fps beast stable has a more straight forward story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors but i found it to be engaging from beginning to end and don't worry there is still plenty of depravity to go around in this movie but i think these movies transcend most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a straighter tone rather than being used exclusively for in your face shock value yes there were definitely moments in this movie where i cringed mightily but i didn't feel that they detracted from the value of the story well maybe a time or two one thing i have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued build up of scorpion's mythos with this entry character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two we get to see that she is much more than just a stone hearted vengeful badass br br as i mentioned earlier in this review a fourth movie followed it also features as scorpion but had a different director without giving anything away i want to mention that fps beast stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary the fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mind blowing trilogy br br i would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out of the ordinary films fps beast stable can be enjoyed as a stand alone piece as can the first two movies but i would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so
<START> a few years ago i saw the scent of green by the same director my feelings about both films are in fact the same beautifully shot but terribly slow and boring i saw this film in a sneak preview and left after half an hour couldn't stand it anymore how can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are and how perfect their lives are i had a fantasy about a forgotten american g i still wandering around in the vietnamese jungle who was not aware the war had ended how he would suddenly pop up in the film and would start emptying his at the characters in the movie the red of their blood would make a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the film so i was not very much gripped by this film time to leave
<START> apparently a massive head wound is the cure for homicidal tendencies turning a murderous sociopath into a lovable and oafish dog catcher also this ones for the ladies it seems that the front gate of a psychiatric hospital is an overlooked hot spot for meeting potential mates those are just two of the approximately 23 absurdities we're supposed to accept for this movie to have any meaning i love movies and i believed as i'm assuming many americans do forgive me if i'm wrong that hollywood turned out the best product i've come to learn how sadly naive and brainwashed i was and 2 how much more sophisticated european asian cinema is in comparison to its american counterpart br br i watched this allegedly disturbing psychological thriller the night following a viewing of a japanese movie called suicide club as the camera faded on walter happy little family enjoying some quality time around a prison visiting room table not to mention the patronizing voice over extolling the virtue of doing the right thing i suddenly had an epiphany i had just finished watching a movie that left me feeling as though i'd just had a glass of water when i really wanted a beer my thirst was sated but it was strictly utilitarian the premise was mildly interesting but the story itself with its innumerable coincidences how do we explain her finding the book we'll just say something like or did the book find her they'll buy that gaping plot holes why did take the skeleton predictability and obligatory happy ending turned out to be just another hollywood hack job additionally the casting of jim carrey was at any moment i felt he was capable of breaking into some shtick from one of his stupid comedies or in living color jim carrey as a tattooed hard boiled police detective who enjoys bondage and rough sex didn't buy it for a second br br you want disturbing deeply disturbing watch suicide club the story surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 school girls the film opens with a group of giggling high schoolers mulling about on a subway train platform we then watch in horror as they line up hold hands and happily throw themselves in front of a fast moving commuter train needless to say much chaos ensues that's as far as i'm going to go with the story line because i encourage the reader to see the film in fact i'm not sure if i could outline the plot even if i wanted to what begins as a straightforward mystery quickly descends into a madhouse of grotesque imagery did i understand the movie many of the foreign films my girlfriend has introduced me to so naturally i thought it was bad but this one lingered in my mind i went to bed thinking on the film and awoke the next morning and looked it up on imdb i read some of the viewer comments and was astonished at 1 the insights others had derived from the film and 2 the fact that i had so thoroughly missed the whole point of the movie i realized that i was so used to being spoon fed the message from hollywood that when confronted with a film that actually required the viewer to actually think for themselves i was totally it's as if i had been conditioned to check my brain at the door of the theater br br am i saying that suicide club is the greatest movie ever made of course not it has its flaws many of which were reported adroitly by the imdb reviewers am i saying that all american movies are bad and all foreign movies are good course not my point is that there's a whole world of film making outside of body of work that engages the viewer forces them to think and that don't telegraph plot twists follow a strict linear sequence and above all don't insult the intelligence of the person watching i look forward to expanding my mind while exploring this new world of film that doesn't do the thinking for me
<START> if you are looking for a modern film version of buster crabbe or johnny weismuller's overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous white safari guides or cunning black tribesmen while saving the animal kingdom this is not the movie for you this is a recounting of the tarzan legend from its beginning in intelligent adult terms it is beautifully filmed and faithful to the edgar rice burroughs stories br br tarzan is no action hero but a man torn between two worlds the natural and the civilized in a stunning performance christopher lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism if he slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag the audience especially the adult audience targeted by the film will laugh and the film will completely lose its grip it will plummet into the cheesy depths but lambert never lets that happen forget what you may think of him in other movies when i saw this film at the theater on its original release i thought he deserved an academy award br br the supporting cast is uniformly excellent as other commentators have noted i disagree with most of them in that i didn't find anything wrong with andie mcdowell's performance i wouldn't have nominated her for an academy award the role is undemanding but she is completely up to it such as it is i don't know why her voice was overdubbed either br br the cinematography of the african segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful it captures both the beauty of the african wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there the scenery is lush and exotic and the colors are vivid br br but this is also a period film and the cinematography also magnificently depicts victorian england the countryside the city and the interiors the costumes are outstanding the soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or obtrusive br br there are some disturbing scenes especially for animal lovers but no more disturbing than a few scenes in dances with wolves this is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature personified in the young lord greystoke convincingly portrayed by christopher lambert
