<START> if only i had read the review by alex sander sic on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public i would not have seen this desecration alien was a fantastic dramatic and well made horror sci fi predator was a great sci fi action mess about i do really have only myself to blame though as i saw versus it too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site br br stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you br br right from the beginning this film was ridiculous no explanation was offered for the predator ship overrun not overrun by aliens ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why from then on it gets really ridiculous i always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out i couldn't here br br a father and son are hunting in the woods the damaged ship crash lands to from the view given i would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible dumb redneck muppet br br an edgy thriller type scenario is introduced with an ex con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless dull now cop friend from the bus when i say introduced i mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out a slasher horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective crazy nasty jock type american sportsman not a scottish man oh the cute not cute boy is the ex brother by the way yes they're clever these director brothers whose name i will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child br br guess what happens next i won't tell you much more about the actual smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the alien ridden universe br br the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post i read too late the aliens are boring the predator alien is ridiculous the action is at times exploitative gratuitous disgusting nonsense the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers oh i was shocked alright shocked at how low some people will go to get what a scare some shock to titillate the perverse what if you really wanted to shock titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them the characters have no depth and neither does the plot it's filmed and paced badly it's acted by disinterested people not that i can blame them it further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci fi characters this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you if you haven't seen it then well please make your own decision br br ps did i even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout
<START> i had read the newspaper reviews of this film and i must say my expectations were very low before watching ocean's 12 i really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever i would rate it top 5 of the worst movie i have ever seen why do i say that first of all there is a story so thin that britney spears crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller the fragments that could be assigned the term story is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive the entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times br br the actors show up but doesn't do anything to deserve any credit or appraise most embarrassing are leading ladies roberts and zeta jones that either overplay or are extremely plain damon clooney and pitt aren't brilliant either to be honest i really don't understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie br br may contains spoilers camera and editing sigh where should i begin there are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful combine that with extremely editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car the camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects not i understand that the scene with tess ocean julia roberts playing julia roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess bruce willis why please explain it to me why br br to summarize if you have to choose between root canal work and watching ocean's 12 i recommend the former make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it
<START> harmony i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded br br i know that there were big questions raised in this movie like who are we really what are we here for is there really a god all great questions but i really don't think that is funny when you have the questions along side such tragedy i'm all for real life being portrayed but come on it's never funny when a wife is being raped someone killing themselves and family and friends find the body and people die for unexplained and unnecessary reasons br br the only good thing about this movie was the location it was filmed there is a lot of beautiful places br br i'm not a film student or even know all that much on the subject i admit this but i do know that when i leave the theater with a feeling of disgust then it was not a film i would recommend to anyone
<START> rented free rental thank goodness this as supposedly filmed in ct where i live could have been filmed in a tunnel for all that matter dark ninety percent of time and just an awful attempt at a low budget flick which can be good if done right in a nutshell about a bunch of young adults who witness meteor fall and subsequently fall prey to aliens on a lighthouse island assisted by keeper and wife analysis br br acting dreadful br br writing uninspired br br story done a million times before with different settings br br production values okay lighting for budget br br effects creature digital other horrible very cheap looking br br so you get the gist of it to add insult to injury end credits has bloopers of filming really now who cares distributed under a universal company shocked they would even do so after viewing br br finally as alternative try creep low budget but well written well acted and fairly well creepy
<START> hello it is i derrick cannon and i welcome you to the first ever review show my movie for this week was debatable what route what movie what excellent four star epic would i choose guess what i decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route i've decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman the stars in this movie include christopher allport as sam eileen seeley as anne marsha clark as marla david allen brooks as agent manners sean patrick murphy as captain fun ray cooney as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost br br it's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frost loved the carrot scene but it's even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie the only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder sam seemed more paranoid then he did in the original his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie his wife however was one of the few bright spots she played her role as the main woman to a hilt she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy the scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given if it wasn't for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like chucky freddy and jason laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had spunk he had humor and most importantly he had an vicious streak br br this movie could have been so much more it could have been a continuation of a great franchise instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled br br this movie gets a two out of ten for me and it's lucky that it even gets a one
<START> like other movies from the worst director ever ed wood this movie is very bad but because of that it is also very funny may be not for everyone but i laughed a lot it is a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie how do you rate it as a movie very low as entertainment at least a little higher br br the movie tries to explain what a transvestite is and it does this through a scientist bela lugosi and an inspector lyle talbot who talks to a doctor timothy farrell who knows about these things the doctor tells the detective two stories and that is what we and apparently the scientist see the doctor tels these stories because a dead transvestite is found suicide and because of a headline in the news paper about a sex change the first and longest story is about glen ed wood himself who is in love and about to marry barbara dolores fuller but he has never told her he like to dress as a woman when he is named glenda the movie tells the same thing over and over again especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual the movie almost says that being a transvestite is not a bad thing but being homosexual is since it keeps telling us the fact that a transvestite is not a homosexual the second story is about a transvestite who really wants a sex change and not just wants to dress up as a woman but it is much shorter and less interesting br br a couple of things make this movie very bad and therefore laughable how the story is presented is the first thing the way the same things are told over and over again and the conclusion of it all are others this is not where it ends the acting is very bad especially dolores fuller seems to be reading her lines directly from a little screen somewhere every thing she says is funny the whole dialogue actually gave me quite some laughs br br there is also a sequence where someone walks into a room the door stays half open and we see something hanging on the wall not completely straight then the door in what seems to be the same shot although we know it is not is a little less open and suddenly the thing on the wall hangs straight ed wood didn't mind to leave this kind of continuity errors in his movie may be a good thing because basically it is just another laugh for the modern audience i think you understand that it is a bad movie and i think there is a good chance you will laugh at the ridiculous mistakes as well
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen bar none from the flimsy looking poorly lit sets to the laughable acting to the infantile plot and shoddy drawn out action sequences this film is so bad its hilarious for about ten minutes after which you will be reaching for the remote or the power socket to end this film non experience although it was obviously made with the entire production and acting collective tongue rammed in cheek please god i found jack frost 2 so dreadful as to be unwatchable for more than a quarter of an hour if you have not had enough of it after this time you must be indulging in drug abuse
<START> collected the audience wherever it was shown it gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world and it is not strange we have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art and it is wise by the way is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up but most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the european union br br the main character of the film is a french student of economy xavier for his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to barcelona in spain it turns out that the lectures are being given in catalonian language that probably doesn't help the of knowledge but it helps in tightening the relationships inside the group of foreign exchange students especially if they rent a big flat together there are 3 girls english belgian and spanish as well as three boys german danish and italian our french guy will also get there a year is a very long time long enough to get close and make friends and get to know some european stereotypes while trying to break them apart br br treats this special case of a process of uniting europe with humor and without he comes out of the idea that young people are everywhere just the same they like jokes they like to make irresponsible relationships but they don't neglect their aspirations the most interesting is the sum of experience of this little community they live together in the fire of everyday tasks fighting with the surrounding reality they are full of unusual ideas for life young europeans come back to their countries to take up a life of an adult on their own they are europe's hope to fight the many problems of the union for example the terrifying administration system in the end they proof that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences but they also now how to live the full of life and they won't allow taking that full of life away from them
<START> i am a fifth grade language arts teacher and after we read this book which the students loved then we watched the movie they laughed out loud unfortunately it's not a comedy the acting was so awful i felt like i was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play my students were mimicking the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through i have to agree with them at times it was pretty bad still i would show it to students again just for fun and to compare the film with the book we did a venn diagram teachers know what that is afterward to show what was the same in both and what were the differences so there is an educational value in showing it i noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005 so we can only hope the acting will be better
<START> just got back from the european premiere of the gamers dorkness rising br br all i can say is that if you are a gamer rpg or larp then this movie is for you and if you're not a gamer well it's still a great deal of fun br br the acting is certainly not oscar worthy but in the whole element of the movie it adds to the charm the humour is everywhere along with some very nice touches the tribute to gary is especially well done if you can spot it the cast are very down to earth in their appearance befitting the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying an ordinary hobby br br the quality of the movie's sound and vision are adequate but again it all just adds to the atmosphere that helps to define this movie as being the dungeons and dragons movie written and performed by gamers for gamers br br not afraid to use terminology specific to one system they still manage to allow product placement to be a part of the movie but in a very understandable and utterly fair manner it also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some gamers can have about other gamers and deals with that quite well br br all in all the movie is very much driven by an well thought out equal balance of character plot and entertainment the bard is amazingly good value for money br br in the end it does make scoring this movie quite hard so i have given it 2 scores br br score for non 7 10 a few moments could go way over your head but the main sections of the movie just work so hard and achieve so much more br br score for 10 10 everything fits together in the perfect quantities and with the perfect charm and sentiment
<START> i saw a screening of this movie last night i had high expectations going into it but was definitely disappointed within 5 minutes of the opening williams is already campaigning for his presidency and he becomes president in the first 40 minutes so there goes all that aspect of the movie the first half hour are hilarious don't get me wrong the movie has its moments but after the first half hour it takes a turn for the worst it becomes less of a comedy and more of a thriller drama love story which is pointless the movie goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes there are laughs interspersed here and there but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning at one point the biggest cheer i heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd yelled during a very confusingly emotional scene williams gives a great performance right on par with his comedic style walken also delivers a strong supporting role as only he can i think the one character that goes underrated is lewis black consistently vulgar and political its funny to see him tone it down for a pg 13 rating overall i would not pay to see the movie afterall i saw it for free and even i was disappointed the first half hour is solid and its all downhill from there not really fitting into a category the movie realizes half way through that it should not have been anything more than a one hour comedy central special 4 5 10
<START> bare wench is another softcore parody of the blair witch project i think there's about two dozen of those things out there it has 5 very attractive women which includes nikki fritz julie smith and julie strain and one dorky guy whose only purpose is to provide comic relief br br okay so i'm thinking cool great looking women having softcore lesbian sex with each other very 10 minutes or so this should be real good br br unfortunately the producers blew it there is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene there's a couple of false starts but the majority of the action is just the women posing for the camera i guess once the producers had spent their money on the women and spent more getting them to remove their clothes they didn't have any money left to get them to actually do anything and i guess they also used up all their alloted nudity time too early because towards the end of the video there is a huge amount of pointless dialogue that is obviously being used for no other reason than to pad out the run time you're a liar no you are you go into the cave no you go i think we should go home well i don't this goes on and on and on forever br br there's way better stuff than this
<START> the one liners fly so fast in this movie that you can watch it over and over and still catch new ones by far one of the best of this genre
<START> after mrs and mr iyer this is yet another very good film by sen mostly in english in the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals in this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family as a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on reality it is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film br br the younger sister konkana sen sharma the daughter of sen is suffering from schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister anjali shabana azmi after her marriage with jojo and separation from him believes that she is still with jojo and her five children in 15 park avenue in there is no such address in it seems there is one in new york and she is intense in her belief it is almost like an intense religious belief ultimately what is reality in one scene she tells anjali if i tell you that you are not a professor but only imagine that you are a professor the open ending reflects this reality in a supposedly search for her home in park avenue is lost the penultimate scene is looking at a group of five children playing and her looking at them with joy of returning to her family and then she is lost about this concept of reality i am reminded of another film of fifties called harry with james stewart the protagonist believes that a big sized rabbit called harry is always with him and he is always conversing with him at the end even the doctor believes perhaps there is harry what is reality is it what the protagonist believes or what other believe azmi dominates the film with her sterling performance as the strong elder sister with undercurrent of frustration konkana sen sharma gives equally befitting performance as the schizophrenic br br yet the film is not as tight as mrs and mr iyer there appear to be some loose ends and perhaps there are too many characters those who want a closed ending may not appreciate the open ending here but the ending befits the theme of the film br br yet another good film by sen
<START> it is not surprising that this film was made by i'm kwon at the time it was he examined the early beauty and tragedy of dynasty life in and delightfully explored a well known korean folk tale in and these comprised his last two films what is most surprising is that chi seon his 2002 offering is not presented in the style of those previous two films br br nonetheless the experienced hand of i'm comes through we explore together the life of a real person a late nineteenth century dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who because of that causes a stir in contemporary korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old korean noble class and his contempt for would be japanese ruling colonials alike the painter chang seung up known popularly as oh won performed magnificently by choi min the famous star of park chan already legendary oldboy becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film contemporary korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that he was so ostracized in his time sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact i'm is a master at capturing his country's past idiosyncrasies and in this film he almost outdoes himself as expected in an i'm film the cinematography is breathtaking the editing is precise and the story is central br br plots are set against seung up family ties are tested and broken scandalous behavior is alleged and is sometimes real all to bring down the man who painted fire but against all the intricacies of detailed but sometimes convoluted account of seung up's life seung up himself somehow manages to survive he becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous chinese paintings after only one look art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off oh won in other words lines of people who wish to take advantage of the real seung up an artistic star begin to form but he refuses to be manipulated his cleverness in off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience if not the cast br br what does seung up think he possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished he despises those who would try to turn art into profit and he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous but he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from france and japan are presented signature historical epic motif and his influence in the realm remains on prominent display in this multi million dollar epic br br the protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint this is when the story takes on a whole new meaning one that is not just political but social in nature i'm takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion br br he oh won becomes a jesus figure the people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be eventually both government and people come down upon seung up in a manner taken straight out of the bible his holiness becomes human his humanity is not accepted he dies for or escapes from the sins of the commoners the art critics the politicians who hound him br br but does he die as with most of films a question remains in this case does seung up really become an immortal hermit the film does not tackle that question it merely presents a possible end for the real man of chang seung up or oh won no death is depicted because no death is known br br it is difficult to find fault with this film but i'm has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does it hardly surprises anymore as usual for films the cinematography the editing and the writing are all first rate it's a well crafted film imbued with uncanny story telling ability granted he may be best at doing this through the ancient korean musical art of still the film contains stretches of this admirable art form and by the end viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great untold story and they have because that precisely is gift
