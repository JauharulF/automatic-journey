<START> yet another in the long line of don't films of the late 70's and early 80's yet this one is much more than that this film is a highly underestimated low budget with a twist it has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it's the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors actresses that make this movie good a young nurse arrives at dr progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be it seems dr masters a rather ambitious female doctor has taken over his duties and begun to implement her own ideas each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions there is the nymphomaniac the crazy old crone the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants and a man who has reverted back to his childhood among others there is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies piling up if you are a fan of cheap 70's sleaze than this is the film for you
<START> river's edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history there were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties but of all the ones i've seen this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing the film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things which takes the story onto another level the film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters the film begins with a murder we then follow the murderer nicknamed john as he goes back to school and tells all his friends about what he has done rather than give the expected reaction most of them hardly react at all and the strongest reaction that the murderer gets comes from who makes it his number one priority to help john clear up the mess he's in and get him out of it the other friends mull over the crime and before long one of them goes to the police br br river's edge features a host of great performances from its young cast keanu reeves has a reputation for wooden acting and for good reason but he fits in very well to this early role and this performance is easily one of his best crispin glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane glover always stands out in every film he's in and while he does go over the top a little bit he convinces well as the lead in this movie reeves and glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes daniel roebuck and joshua john miller as well as the great dennis hopper in another wild role the film features a very gritty picture which bodes well with its nihilistic tone the central characters are all of the generation and the way that they genuinely don't seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is both strong and well defined the film is also rather funny owing to some of the characters' lines but the humour is pitch black and clearly this film was never meant to be a comedy overall this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing
<START> this film is absolute cinematic genius it has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance the effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie jack long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil if your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy for any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin this film is definitely 10 10 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time
<START> if you like cagney you'll like this film it has the pretense of american integrity at any cost personal or social cagney plays the head of weights and measures in nyc cagney goes up against crooked politicians the criminal underground a prominent philanthropist and simple who add a few ounces to the price of a chicken the chicken scene is hilarious where cagney finds a weight placed in the bird cavity by an unsuspecting butcher the chicken gets tossed around the shop in a hilarious scene about who controls the evidence if you like old telephones there are interesting scenes of phones and even bizarre phone cords compared to a lot of film made today this is pure entertainment and includes mystery with comedy and a message that honesty above all should be the guiding principle of humanity made in simpler times it reflects a world we can't find today the fashion especially hats and automobiles all play a prominent visual role in defining this little film
<START> george really went all out and over the top which in this case was great i've heard the len version but it was too tame george was great in that character very expressive br br angela lansbury was perfect for the part she gave a great performance she gave the mrs lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story br br i love the dark humor when angela lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of george in his songs of rage vengeance and distress br br i've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when i saw it on pbs i bought it on video after copying it in 1985 on my own when it came out in 1990 and i definitely bought a copy of the dvd when it came out in 2004
<START> the only conceivable flaw of this film is it's title please stop comparing it to the first i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you haven't seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this is a great exponent of screwy mid 80s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom 100 is because of its title i usually hate movies like these i e adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically i dunno maybe it's like a bad relationship i can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind 'the stunt man ' br br robert stack we love you 1919 2003
<START> an opera diva has an accident which leaves the door open for her to take over the role betty is now the star of mac beth but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out he gets his kicks out of tying betty up putting needles under her eyes so she cant close them and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyes br br opera is certainly one of argento's more ambitious films like mixing it up with macbeth there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is giuseppe verdi's version of macbeth but also argento just like shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and misfortune and like the ravens circling the castle foreboding the demise of the scheming macbeth the ravens in opera play a key part in the downfall of the killer furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the of his lover but i don't want to go as far as saying opera is intended to be a remake of the either the phantom of the opera or macbeth the similarities are far too subtle it's just a typical argento masterstroke and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of gothic mystique br br although this movie does have it downsides like the metal soundtrack just doesn't fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange br br all in all opera is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good
<START> i finally managed to get myself a copy of dario argento's opera and i tell you that was about time it was the last argento movie i had yet to see and i'm a fan of most of his work i reckon that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint like phenomena but the plot idea of opera always appealed to me and it turns out i was right i enjoyed every shot in opera and i was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last out of all the argento movies opera went straight to the number one spot and i hope i can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well br br the script and plot idea of opera is rather simple especially compared to argento's previous movie phenomena that had too many ideas in it and ended up being a mess the plot of opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time it's an excellent satiric comment almost a spoof towards the opponents of explicit violence spoilers a young opera singer the gorgeous cristina is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer during every massacre he commits he forces betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open there are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them they're getting torn apart end spoilers to this simple yet effective idea argento adds a lot of horrific elements like ravens the classic piece and curse of macbeth and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value ancient masters like edgar allen poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them and dario argento knows it as well br br the violence and gore is very well presented in opera and that's what makes this a true argento picture his best in my opinion with profondo rosso as a close second i surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you especially for fans of the italian horror business this is an absolute must favorite rewind scene argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where betty's friend is getting shot in the eye while she's trying to see who's in front of the door
<START> as a late going patron of the drive in 1970's 1980s there are many movies that i have seen forgotten this is one i could never forget despite its low budget exploitation style of movie making the story was very well done the isolated therapy asylum where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene the supposed assistant doctor taking over the various crazy the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself and finally the rescue of the young nurse by the simple minded sam who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape unharmed made for a great story which held the film together i emphasised the word story because that's what makes a good or great film no matter how much blood gore nudity sexual matter or outrageous behaviour you put in a film if the story is not good then the film is not good the film credits show clips of all the actors including the old hag with the final line telling you to get out never come back which is a great ending to this film if it is out on video dvd see it enjoy it
<START> this is a film that every child should see before they grow and get distorted often passed down ideas from generation to generation of family i grew up in two different places although only 20 miles apart i went to school had friends of every color creed religion for the first 8 years of my life then i moved to hillbilly country although not anymore where it was very unusual to even have one african american kid in your class my graduating class in high school had 2 or 3 african god why can't i just say black you can call me a honky or whitey or whatever all of this political correctness peeves me as it does most others anyway back to the film give this a try to see what happens when people get a distorted view or just what ignorance or a lack of understanding does to a culture or a country this is an excellent film everyone should see especially children
<START> like richard pryor mason never got the material he deserved whatever you know of him is probably wrong get past the accent and go see his stand up you'll be very surprised he's one of the best stand ups i've ever seen and i have seen a lot of stand up comedy from lenny bruce to eddie murphy to jerry seinfeld to chris rock jackie mason is definitely up there he's known for being a comic's comic even howard stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever br br the that mason is no dangerfield is ridiculous dangerfield is known for having been a huge mason fan dangerfield's career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following mason's shows that is when mason provided dangerfield with inspiration for his get no respect routine while i think dangerfield is great see them both do stand up and you'll see mason is the better comedian
<START> the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to due in no small part to john woo's masterful direction coupled with kat's superb cinematography some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art house film both james and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate is particularly good as the baddest of the bad it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before normally played a hero and in fact with his moustache i didn't even recognize him at first sammo's goofy buck teeth only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable in a villain you love to hate kind of way his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic jackie chan appears briefly early on and late in the going as a blacksmith and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent
<START> ok anatomie is not a reinvention of the horrormovie genre but nevertheless it is well done good actors potente and at first and some nice ideas made me happy maybe i would have been not so positive if this wasnÂ´t a german movie but who cares it is good to see familiar faces in a good thrilling story with some gore and some good jokes in it all of you complaining about the dubbing i didnÂ´t see a dubbed version of course but i believe that it is not easy for you to watch dubbed movies we germans are used to watch movies like that so itÂ´s not a big problem but try to watch in german with subtitles the actors are really good
<START> travolta thurman the rock vaughn keitel and so on one should think that this star parade of great actors could really heat up this movie but no travolta takes on the role as chili palmer again but this time we have already seen the gangster who tries hes luck in the hard world of movie making its not funny anymore this is a typically problem in hollywood they think that if the first was good the second will be twice as good no the first was original the second cant be hey hollywood try to understand originality cant be duplicated you got to give us a new twist not just the same movie again made with a bigger budget i constantly found my selves hardly laughing when i was watching this movie but still it got a lot of cool actors like harvey keitel james woods vince vaughn and the rock and for that and that only br br 4 10
