<START> only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be i will state the following without repeating the obvious flaws plainly stated by some of the other commentators the film is shot on video what type of camera i don't know but the cameraman had it on autofocus all the time so that any slight movement makes it go in and out of focus in many of the scenes the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes this alone screams amateur br br i also noticed that out in the 'middle of the you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the lights loudly br br also what is with that single lighting source that follows and many times 'leads' the actors when they walk around it looks like a newscaster with that 'on camera light' that follows the people around like a spotlight there was no 'credit' for lighting design dp and i know why the saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture note i didn't say film so be prepared for a single glaring spotlight as the sole source of for most of the movie br br this is probably the most technically inept production i've ever seen commercially released i bought this title because i like bad cinema usually it's so bad that you can laugh at it this is just so bad that it's unwatchable plan nine from outer space is citizen kane in comparison to this title
<START> this is a great story although there are some jimmy stewart cornball parts for the most part it is a compelling tale about an individual with a compelling drive vision and sense of adventure to say the least the bottom line is it is one of my favorites to watch and i've done so probably dozens to times that is until someone stole it our of a bag i left on a plane on a flight to california br br some have commented about too many flashbacks but i don't know a better way to keep a long flight interesting for those of us who actually fly flight can be hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror i wouldn't have wanted to see the flight shortened at all the oppressive need for sleep and the drone and surrounding loneliness is part of the story br br there are many parts that i particularly like including the takeoff from long island and landing at night in paris wow things have really changed with us and the french since then the airplane building scenes and the record breaking flight from san diego are interesting as is the incident over the atlantic in ice which i understand is not completely true but did happen on the san diego flight br br one gets the sense that one of biggest assets are his enlightened supporters as well as his persistence br br some of the lines that ring in my head now and then include pull the on the takeoff scene and i hope i don't have to use it that way when describing the submarine like periscope to the lady who lent him a mirror so he could better see his overhead instruments br br this movie is not for everybody but it certainly is for me i hope they make it on dvd soon so i can replace my stolen version
<START> this is a pretty pointless remake starting with the opening title shots of the original was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what a great little period piece chiller that was the new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy br br brian kerwin plays a 'city boy' photographer who returns to a semi abandoned desert town populated by a scattering of underdeveloped clichÃ©d stock characters the lollipop sucking doll lolita the old coot prospector the crippled vet and his asian wife etc br br character witnesses the crashing of 'something' into a hillside and shortly after strange things start to happen as pieces of weird blue rock are scattered around the temperature starts to rise all the water in the area vanishes people start to act weirdly things explode character gets in and out of his car more often than is humanly possible in one movie the film develops no sense of place no character development no humour no tension everything that made the jack arnold's original a creepy little cold war paranoia classic has been abandoned it just runs through its minimal hoops and then just ends br br the special effects aren't very special the interior of the ship looks like bits of cling film wrapped round some ropes which were then dangled in front of the camera to frame some of the most uninspired and clumsy wire work ever put onto the screen the script is repetitive everyone says everything at least twice kerwin gets to say let's get out of here at least three times during the movie twice in one scene loads of things are left unexplained at the end why do the aliens need all the heat and water for example not that anyone watching would care if the film makers didn't care why should we br br the acting is adequate better than the script which at times has an under rehearsed improvisational quality deserves though often the actors look like they just want to get the thing over with as quickly as possible a notable example of this is when elizabeth peÃ±a registers the briefest token moment of frustrated despair hands to face gesture before following sulking son stevie outside to watch him do angry sulky teenager smashing something off a table gesture br br continuity errors include the gb sticker on the back of jeep appearing and disappearing a double action of the gas in the exploding car a towns person being in two places simultaneously once in the alien pov shot then immediately afterwards in a reaction shot elizabeth peÃ±a appearing to shut a car door twice you can tell i was gripped can't you the movie commits that greatest of errors it's boring
<START> i first saw the movie a couple of years ago and was totally and utterly impressed but its sensuality it is one of the most touching films i have ever seen though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial too much beautiful if you will anyway one thing is for sure the camera man has done a great job each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art comparable to the or bernard paintings br br the music forms a perfect background for the story especially u2's one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene as for the casting i cannot be objective since i like sophie and jean very much and cannot add more to the praising comments of others br br however the very fact that many people critics and those sophisticated in cinema criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time no doubt the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous but this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film the second novel when sophie tells her story to is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked or what apparently it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the husky voice of is being unable to link it to the main plot br br other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot which indulges many of the logic fallacies within them the scene when jean is overlooking the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible the feeling of moist air and fine haze which is being spread by the first scene can literally be sensed through the screen no doubt antonioni is a great master of shades and semi shades my favorite novel is the last one the most romantic deep and meaningful i guess that it the most antonioni like one in the whole movie almost a parable probably the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small italian town with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements fountains with the and monumental cathedrals it was laconic but really touching br br i hope that my impressions and comments on the movie however chaotic they are would motivate somebody to spend an evening watching it it works better with the home theater having somebody caring by your side than in the movie theater enjoy br br i beg your pardon for the imperfect english and any possible misspellings
<START> i liked the whole set up with palace the roman guards and announcers in this event also marked the passing of the torch as far as the voice of the wwf goes gorilla monsoon who had done the play by play for every wwf ppv up to this point opens up and gives the typical introduction making it look like he's there to announce another ppv but then introduces jim ross who is making his wwf debut and jr continues to do the wwf commentary to this day but outside of that this event is pure garbage good ol scientific wrestling has been thrown out the window and enter the birth of gimmicks this to me was the event that the wwf started to go down the toilet and didn't recover until the attitude era of the late 90's here's a review of the event br br ic title match tatanka challenger vs shawn michaels champ an okay opener but given what shawn is capable of it was very disappointing i have no idea why the wwf was hell bent on putting tatanka over they should of realized that shawn was the future and tatanka was just some hyper wrestler in an indian the ending of the match itself was very lame shawn grabs the ref and pulls him out then gets called for a count out while it was fun watching sherri get beat up afterwords this match just was forgettable shawn had to carry this match and had trouble doing it br br the brothers vs the headshrinkers steiners get the win via a this match had it's moments but the crowd just didn't seem into it there was no heat behind it i think it was a match just to throw two tag teams in br br crush vs doink the clown terrible terrible terrible this match completely sucked two very lame gimmicks a clown and a hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors the ending caught everybody by surprise in the upcoming months crush turned heel and doink turned face but none of the fans seem to care sadly this was not the worst match on the card br br razor ramon vs bob you got a brand new heel that is very over going against a wrestler who was forgotten about 10 years ago the fans snicker and laugh when comes out and like hogan rock in and hhh owen in the heel wrestler gets louder cheers in the face thankfully this match was short the right guy won but i wish they had razor totally beat the crap out of and squash rather than winning by a small package out of nowhere br br tag team champion match ted dibiase and irs champs vs hulk hogan brutus beefcake w jimmy hart i still would like to know the full story on what happened to hogan's eye oh well the crowd was really into this match but it had no flow to it what so ever hogan and beefcake were clearly suffering ring rust given that both wrestlers had been on the shelf for at least a year dibiase being the great technical wrestler that he was did help to carry the match from being a complete waste the ending was a surprise with dibiase and irs getting the win via dq but to please the crowd hogan and beefcake did their usual playing to the crowd at the end like they had won the match br br lex luger vs mr perfect the best part of this match was the four hot chicks that accompanied lex luger to the ring other than that this was completely forgettable the mr perfect gimmick was born for a heel role and he just lacked the heat as a face and luger is just a waste of time no matter what gimmick he's in luger wins via a despite that feet were in the ropes then perfect spends the post match getting his butt kicked first luger knocks him out with the running elbow then when perfect regains consciousness he goes back to the dressing room to find luger only to get the crap beaten out of him by shawn michaels setting up an hbk perfect feud that had the potential to be a classic but the wwf misused br br the undertaker vs giant gonzales absolute crap what was the wwf thinking bringing in such a horrible wrestler as giant gonzales sure he had size but i'd rather watch the brooklyn in a match than him this isn't even worth commenting on br br wwf championship match bret hart champ vs yokozuna challenger you have one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time going against a guy who's only advantage is that he's a gigantic lard ass bret was able to carry the match but a rather predictable ending with mr fuji throwing salt in face br br post match yokozuna vs hulk hogan pure crap right here hogan comes down to the ring for no apparent reason and mr fuji challenges him to a match after yoko just won the title even the die hard hulkamaniacs find this to be total bs
<START> bottom of the barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny the plot is about an american mercenary played by reb brown in the film he's called a military adviser but it's not really clear if he's in the american military or not helping the army of a latin american country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him imprisons and tortures him shannon tweed is a sports equipment saleswoman he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue that description actually makes the movie sound better than it is because it's really a stinker of almost biblical proportions how bad is it well shannon tweed turns in the movie's most professional acting job if that isn't an indication of just what a 12th rate piece of junk this turkey is nothing is from mismatched sound effects to a music score that sounds like it's from a 1940s z grade horror flick and may very well be to the same footage i e armored personnel carriers going down the same jungle trail reused constantly to some of the most ineptly staged action scenes in recent memory this laugh a minute has to be seen to be tweed looks bored brown looks hung over and by the time this thing is finished if you can last that long i couldn't you'll know just how they feel br br although there are a lot of explosions and gunfights this can't be considered an action picture by any stretch of the imagination it's boring there's a scene in the back of a truck where everybody just stares at each other for three or four minutes repetitive the same rebels and soldiers being killed over and over illogical when a group of rebels is caught in an open field by a government helicopter gunship instead of breaking for cover they just stand there staring up at it inept soldiers and rebels falling dead when no gunshots are heard a gun battle inside a house where combatants standing against walls are machine gunned but miraculously the walls escape undamaged predictable when the governor says to offer a reward for brown's capture because someone might turn him in you know exactly who that someone will be and it turns out to be exactly who you thought it was and just downright stupid pretty much everything else in the picture inept brainless and stupid beyond belief don't waste your time
<START> the club scenes in this film are extremely believable tim curry is in his most venal mode and there are enough drugs and violence here for two movies maybe even three what more do you require from an evening's entertainment pump up the volume
<START> the entire civilized world by now knows that this is where emil sitka says his immortal hold hands you lovebirds but shemp howard professor of music steals the show watch him tutoring dee green as she the voices of spring watch shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string watch him as he gets by christine mcintyre watch him and you will laugh and learn moe is no slouch either watch him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap larry as usual is the zen master of reaction all in all one of the very best stooge shorts you won't find one weak moment
<START> this movie was pretentious foppish and just down right not funny the filming technique reminded me of mtv i am a fan of hartley but what was he thinking of so much more thought could have gone into this movie considering the subject matter this could have been a true theoretical battle over good and evil but hartley it appears used the stand technique of psyching out the viewer
<START> this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime the acting atrocious the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female after watching this movie it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours also a bottle of valium would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life the plot is nothing original the dialog excruciating and even the weapons seem sub par do yourself a favor and go to your local blockbuster and burn whatever copies they have of this horrid film
<START> excellent episode showed dean has not only good taste by picking cassie for his girlfriend but also shows he does have a heart and can love just one woman and he's not just some guy who loves and leaves em e episode applaud them on this one i only hope that some way they go back to the cassie relationship next season if there is a next season i would like to see her come back into their supernatural lives especially dean's also i like the fact the chose an african american woman to be the special lady in his life that got away somehow i hope they don't screw that up and end it as he episdoe ended the girl who played cassie was truly a looker and it was good to see the wb branching out into what we all see in everyday life the interacial coupling that has become common and acceptable finally
<START> obviously made on the cheap to capitalize on the notorious mandingo this crassly pandering hunk of blithely rancid italian sexploitation junk really pours on the sordid stuff with a commendable lack of taste and restraint the evil arrogant white family who own and operate a lavish slave plantation spend a majority of the screen time engaging in hanky panky both each other and their various slaves director mario and screenwriter cram this fetid filth with a teeming surplus of sizzling sleaze we've got nasty rape interracial copulation one white lady makes wild love to a muscular black stud while he's tied to a cross copious female nudity brutal vile degradation lots of lurid soft core sex and a severely twisted tragic surprise ending that mixes elements of incest murder and miscegenation in a questionable attempt at making a statement about the horrid inhumanity of slavery special kudos are in order for foxy brunette actress paola whose lusty and uninhibited portrayal of depraved and lascivious wicked bitch rhonda positively burns up the screen moreover marcello giombini's funky throbbing tribal score hits the groovy spot fairly polished cinematography likewise does the trick a satisfyingly seamy chunk of slimy swill
<START> ok so she doesn't have caller id when you are being stalked you get it and no cell phone when you are being stalked you get one if you are one of the few full time working parents that is the head of the household that doesn't own one already this mom gets a big zero in the parenting department so her mom is in the hospital and she decides a shopping trip will help her out just a stupid movie glad i have tivo and a ff button on the remote and what is with the 10 line minimum i just don't have that much to say about such a bad movie i guess i can ask why she keeps opening packages that she has no clue who they are from the son really didn't add much to the movie either the cops were a big ol zero too now get to the nearest verizon and get the darn cell phone
<START> a terrific fast paced screwball like comic strip drama farce set against france's 1939 implosion played with wide eyed straight faced intensity by a talented cast and with action satire social commentary and authentic period details from slick hairdos and hairdos to a fleet of citroen a rollicking soundtrack and brief but credible impersonations of charles de and marshal br br it's simply some of the best entertainment recently shown on screen devoid of presumption and message if movies were trains and there is a creative recreation of a trip on a steam driven train that works despite there being no steam locomotive an expensive prop no doubt this would be a
<START> i don't really know why so many persons love this movie maybe it's funny ok but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written as the author himself said this movie has betrayed the book not only the story is violently cut to about 1 3 but all the symbols all the complexity everything is lost in a very 80's fashioned fantasy adventure film for kids today we have effects directors a new attention to books i hope that someone tim burton peter jackson hayao miyazaki someday will direct the real neverending story a great dead writer a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it
