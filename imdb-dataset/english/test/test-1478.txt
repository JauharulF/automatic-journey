<START> as the '70's drew to a close rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of sean connery to the role he had made famous back in 1962 james bond br br cubby broccoli was asked on location in brazil during the making of by the b b c 's barry norman how he viewed the prospect understandably the producer was reluctant to commit himself to an opinion br br when opened bond fans were outraged by what they perceived to be a of the character and the jumping onto the 'star wars' bandwagon much as 'live let die' had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier many publicly vocalised their hope that connery would return if only to show eon how a real bond movie should look br br years of legal battles followed the original script entitled 'james bond of the secret service' later retitled was written by kevin len deighton and connery was never filmed and remains one of the great unmade movie blockbusters br br a new script closer to the storyline was commissioned it was written by lorenzo semple junior best known as the man who put the camp into 'batman' he had also written 'the parallax view' one of the decade's finest conspiracy thrillers feeling the script needed a british touch connery brought in dick clement and ian la frenais writers of hit british sitcoms 'the likely and the witty title was suggested by connery's wife br br 'never say never again' opened just before christmas 1983 to a shower of critical praise normally sensible critics were so ecstatic at connery's return they ignored all other aspects of the film many used it to viciously attack the roger moore series particularly that year's in truth is superior in every respect lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with bond at times it looks like a made for t v movie the story had been done before and better in 1965's hence was always going to come off second best it was also hampered by not being part of the official series meaning that monty norman's 'james bond theme' and maurice binder's gun barrel logo could not be used br br as bond connery is magnificent effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role playing bond as an older wiser agent worked barbara carrera landed her best movie role as villainous a lady whose love for murder is such she dances after so she thinks killing bond kim basinger smolders as 'domino' as s p e c t r e agent klaus maria brandauer gives a chilling performance a major disappointment though is max von sydow as the posters gave the impression he would be a major character in fact he appears only in a few scenes with a stronger script he could have been one of the all time great bond villains br br promised to be a throwback to the early eon bonds such as 'from russia with love' but did not deliver the gadgets were there but were used almost apologetically bond's rocket firing motorcycle was a tired gimmick even in the '60's the film tried to compete with eon's bonds in terms of humour bond saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassin's face is a farcical a moment as any you will find in but the nadir comes with the introduction of rowan atkinson as bumbling foreign office official small he gives a performance so staggeringly awful you wonder if he thought he was in a revue br br michel music is horrible the man seems to never to have seen a bond film in his life br br though the film was a financial success viewed years later it stands as the weakest bond of the '80's connery himself was disappointed with it and not did act in a movie again for some years br br 1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs in addition to the connery and moore movies george did a delightful cameo in the made for t v 'return of the man from u n c l e the fifteen years later affair'
<START> rattlesnake look out is that a bra you're wearing or are you expecting an assassination attempt spaz what are you a homo or what ok way to go you guys feed fink he's our hot man do you know they use the most sophisticated training methods from the soviet union east west germany and the newest olympic power trinidad oh spaz you old make out master what no mustard oh my god his nose is bleeding it's gonna get even bigger now our political roundtable henry kissinger will appear is gonna come out spend a weekend with the kids just rap with them br br these and many other great lines make meatballs a hall of fame comedy only in caddyshack is bill murray funnier he probably ad libbed half the lines the high school actors seemed to have a blast being in the same movie with him br br hilarious movie to watch any time of year not just the summer
<START> definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over think their movies br br lots of action lots of great dialogue e g fun to quote a little intrigue and stuff blowing up all over the place samuel l jackson and geena davis had great chemistry violent but not gory the fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn about br br have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months i initially rented the movie because samuel l jackson was in the film but was caught up in the events surrounding samantha's quest to regain her memory and have never looked back br br all you cerebral folks out there suspend disbelief for once take yourself a little less seriously you might actually enjoy yourselves
<START> i think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must've come on and rated it because i'm telling you its just awful the acting is worse than bad the effects are like something you'd see out of a 1970 episode of doctor who the story is well there is no story and they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over and over again and the werewolf its like the muppets they used in wing commander the giant cats remember how bad they looked the werewolf is that bad seriously the guy who directed this thing is terrible and should never get to direct anything else again except maybe his son's school play but even then he should have to pay the audience to see it is nothing but a bad joke
<START> i enjoyed some of the older doctor who many years ago so when the new one came out i just had to check it out i was so pleased with the characters the story lines the updated look i became hooked from season 1 27 for the old fans through to season 2 28 it just keeps on getting better it ties in nicely with the old shows too although you don't have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version br br even though there has been a change of cast i highly recommend doctor who with chris eccleston and with david tennant br br i like that they've given the characters so much depth the doctor seems more vulnerable in this series maybe because he is the last the range of emotions which chris and david show are truly remarkable and i felt their pain anger and sense of adventure right along with them br br billie piper rose brings a very human element to each episode although she is much than i would be with her talent billie will go far in the industry
<START> hair is one of my favorite movies of all times even not being part of my generation i already watched this movie 9 times and i can't get enough with the beautiful message of understanding passion beauty and love this movie is against the vietnam war and shows how people should be united independent of the color origins religions and classes i love the characters berger and woof and i think central park of the 70's one of the most beautiful places i already saw in my life br br by the way i still have this music in my mind br br when the moon is in the seventh house and jupiter aligns with mars then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars br br this is the dawning of the age of aquarius the age of aquarius aquarius aquarius br br harmony and understanding sympathy and trust abounding no more falsehoods or decisions golden living dreams of visions mystic crystal revelation and the mind's true liberation aquarius aquarius br br ps i am surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of amadeus i just love both movies
<START> sharpe's honour for the uninitiated is the fifth entry in a series of tv movies focusing on an english army rifleman during the napoleonic wars and based on the books by bernard cornwell which i strongly recommend reading if you were to start by watching this particular one though you'd get the impression that sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the rest of the army revolves around should that be the case i'd recommend starting with earlier chapters like sharpe's eagle or sharpe's company but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing br br the story this time is all about the espionage side of things with the french army retreating in disarray from spain major the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round by pinning the murder of a spanish on richard sharpe hero of the british army the fragile british spanish alliance will start to crumble and things will turn around again when the spanish nobles come to wellington crying for sharpe's blood though the english general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and soon he's off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot surprisingly enough for a sharpe film as well there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the way fancy that br br what this results in of course is a more adventure style approach the concentration is less on the workings of the english military with sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside dodging french patrols hob with the spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions sergeant harper his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive strangely enough though they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of harper's baby br br this slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode but is only a good thing in the long run and should anyone be worried that there won't be the standard battle at the climax fret not because once again the poor old french get a right kicking furthermore makes a fantastic successor to as the bad guy you love to hate he is a duplicitous malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of raiders of the lost ark elsewhere stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born even if he does look like a member of iron maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident br br in short then another strong chapter in the sharpe series sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film it's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to sharpe that we don't normally get to witness the action hero rather than the professional soldier and if that's not enough to get you tempted it's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged sean bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns
<START> where do we go from here that is the overriding question of this film and make no mistake etc ' the 2003 effort from director john jansen asks far more questions than it answers but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one br br much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies and i'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery however one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer questions are raised Â everything from the mundane to the profound Â but jansen skillfully forces his audience to examine and answer these questions ourselves with little to no help from the characters br br side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of non linear segments to introduce us to the main characters we meet them on the morning of april 8 1994 Â the day kurt cobain committed suicide and it is the death of cobain and the journey to his wake two days later in seattle that serve as the backdrop for the film in exploring life music and death the characters attempt with varying degrees of success to understand and come to terms with their own lives br br there are some aspects of the film that are what you might expect from a low budget indie film the performances range from decidedly mediocre to outstanding with the strongest performances coming from jessica scott holly and noel wood daniel some of the dialogue is admittedly a bit stiff but never completely strays into the unreal and there are some minor sound problems particularly once we get on the road that make it difficult at times to follow the action on screen br br but despite its shortcomings etc ' is a solid deeply affecting piece of cinema amid moments of haunting poignancy laugh out loud humor and intimate turmoil jansen deftly weaves all of the character threads together and illuminates their own struggles while at the same time making them accessible and engaging for us and because we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters we can identify with the questions and issues they're struggling with and we're able to look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994 when for many people the world changed br br while jansen takes credit for the writing editing and direction of the film kudos must be given to his photography as well with an uncanny eye and amazing ability to capture and draw us into each of the characters' worlds jansen managed to produce shot after shot after shot that stuck with me long after the credits rolled br br and no review of this film would be complete without a nod to the amazing soundtrack the music in this film is used to amazing effect at times subtly underscoring the action at other times taking center stage but never getting in the way or deteriorating into kitschy music video the soundtrack plays like the ultimate greatest hits though i suspect that label would probably not sit very well with the director br br the new double dvd archive edition offers some deleted scenes trailers music videos and a cobain documentary the deleted scenes offer some insight into the making of the film through alternate opening and closing sequences and it's certainly a treat to have the rare and beautiful raining kind video the cobain documentary is fine if a bit worse for wear and certainly more extensive documentaries are available for the hardcore fans conspicuously absent is a director commentary and i can't help but wonder if jansen has plans to re release this at some point with that tasty tidbit attached br br suffice to say that the next time you're looking for a strong piece of work from a talented filmmaker i recommend you get on board
<START> here in germany it was only shown on tv one time today as everything becomes mainstream it's absolute impossible to watch a film like this again on the screen maybe it's the same in usa or especially gb the message is a brutal truth find friends to make your ideas come a bit closer to reality or you become a loser if not an asshole instead br br the whole film is not particularly as simple as it may seem here every little scene every sentence every behavior of the characters show a sharp look at what could happen when one person is not accepted in a sadistic crowd which calls itself normal br br very well played by all this is a must seen who is the main character john not cox folks remember ore niles who still is bimbo decide and you will get the plot as it is intended br br a bitter look at what society becomes in a repressive system kind of catcher in the rye and lord of the flies thought to the very end br br the final maybe change your own mind word
<START> the one is a very aptly name show mostly because it comes close to being the only network shows on in prime time that barely more than one person is watching br br when i first heard of the one i thought to myself another sing song show we don't have enough of those and then proceeded to strap on my helmet and run about my home hitting my head on blunt objects and sharp corners because in all honesty the constant year round pain and suffering inflicted by having only one or two talent based reality shows running just isn't enough we needed another one and not just any one the one the one with slightly less attractive contestants with slightly less talent the one with slightly less of a point though it's hard to imagine a scenario in which that's possible the one with pointless footage of the contestants when they're not performing included because i care what johnny sings a lot does in his off hours i really do now you may be thinking hey on the entire continent of north america less than 4 million people watched the first episode doesn't that mean this show sucks well to that i say less than 4 million people in north america have syphilis so sometimes low numbers bring good news now don't they think about it br br in the end the one may be horribly unoriginal a show that even the airing network couldn't be bothered to promote because they too realize how absolutely worthless it is but it's still not syphilis yay
<START> i say this if you want to see art you go to an art gallery if you want to see a movie you go to a theater trying to intertwine art and film proves disastrous in where the heart is an interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment you like dabney coleman see short time you like crispin glover see bartleby you like uma thurman see kill bill above all if you like christopher plummer see the silent partner because his character here is a terrible embarrassment in fact this entire production is an embarrassment sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes so make a short but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense masquerading as filmed entertainment merk
<START> a lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul some a handful others maybe a couple br br then there's linda blair the exorcist that's it br br when you see chained heat and watch linda blair in it you have to wonder what if anything was running through her mind br br certainly not oh boy oscar for best actress here i come br br just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s this one actually has names you may recognize john vernon plays the dean i mean the warden with a hot tub in his office wonder what he told the contractor stella stevens pops up even henry silva and louisa moritz show how bad they needed the work br br and special mention of course for our heroine sybil danning as a bisexual prisoner who puts the moves on poor blair to paraphrase sybil is as sybil does and everything sybil does is done perfect makes you forget what a terrible movie you're watching br br almost br br two stars one for sybil and another for trying to pass off linda blair as a sex symbol whatever could have possessed them get it
<START> i just recently bought the big trail 1930 it's an awesome amazing film i knew it by reputation but never expected it to be so magnificent my version is the one shot in 35mm and i'll speak of that again later when one thinks of the western myth in film the names that come to mind are john ford and john wayne well you have only half the team here but the entire myth is present raoul walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the struggle of the expansion of the nation br br there is a plot centering on a romance between breck coleman wayne and ruth cameron margaret churchill with the main villain red flack being memorably played by tyrone power sr but this has an almost incidental quality as the wagon train struggles forward against incredible natural and human examples are the crossing of the river the indian battle and traversing the burning desert the aftermath of the battle is given a sombre touch when a doll is placed on the grave of a child killed while a faithful dog lies down on its master's grave br br magnificent panoramas are filled with energy and activity the opening scene as the wagon train prepares to leave the square dance interlude and the great buffalo herds are some that spring to mind marvellous use is made of location shooting throughout another feature of this splendid film is the fact that men and women are given equal credit for their parts in the great struggle women work fight and confront the terrible hardships with the same fortitude and strength as their male counterparts the finale has a powerfully uplifting experience as coleman and cameron meet in the gigantic towering sequoia forest to start their new life br br the acting is quite acceptable throughout i've already mentioned tyrone power's scene stealing performance tully marshall is excellent as coleman's sidekick and marguerite churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner strength as she encounters her own problems as well as those external to herself the comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in the tremendous sweep of the film br br i've read much criticism of wayne's even going so far as to blame his wooden acting for the failure of the film at the box office i think this is unfair wayne was in his first major role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in stagecoach but he still does a serviceable job in a role which is certainly going to play second fiddle to the great over arching theme after the big trail wayne played in a large number of low budget b westerns i have a number of these and one can see the developing actor in them when stagecoach came he was ready for it and the big trail was a significant part of that apprenticeship br br i mentioned earlier that my version is the one shot in 35mm it's still impressive but to get some idea of the effect of the 70mm version i set the tv screen to 16 9 which doesn't cause any distortion while not having the complete effect of the grandeur version it was good enough to make me want to get the latter in addition the film shot in 70mm has a few extra scenes not in the form made for ordinary theatrical showing br br all in all this film deserves to be in any list of the greatest westerns ever made
<START> br br i was fascinated to read the range of opinions on circus' from awesome breathtaking and most things between right down to golden turkey candidate' i find myself in the latter camp br br the producers obviously thought that if they mixed plenty of over the top violence with barrages of four letter expletives they'd have another lock stock and two smoking barrels' on their hands a pity that they forgot to include wit style charm and flair and it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to welles' classic the lady from shanghai' thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be br br john hannah gets his shirt off at every opportunity a huge american drives around in a mini minor as circus' pathetically strains for cult status and even the beautiful amanda donohoe can't add any class to these proceedings br br if you want to see a good brit film try the sublime wonderland'
<START> surrender cinema has been known for their extremely erotic almost explicit sci fi films while they generally do very well at these 1 2 virtual encounters this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape any number of girls some recognizable and others not are in this film in all stages of nudity there are also several clips from other films which are outstanding unless you've seen those other films there are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things some playing basketball others talking still others playing with themselves the only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene a short but erotic girl girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable sandy and a more subdued not highly recommended
