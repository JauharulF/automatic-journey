<START> i had the unlucky experience of stumbling upon a preview for this movie and thought it might be interesting i am a fan of the two main actors and i even find meatloaf to be oddly appealing but that couldn't compensate for the droning plot of this movie this movie attempts to make social comments and be artfully intelligent i am sure the audience gets the sociological message clearly but has to suffer in the process personally no matter how bad the movie is i can't stop it in the middle something drives me to finish the worst of movies but i often regret it this is one of those
<START> a mixture of alien and ghost busters br br starts very promising then slows down to almost boring br br lifeforce contains some awesome special effects they were able to make in the mid 80's the story is intriguing but becomes quite lack lustre in the end it was rated r because of the nudeness sex and gore mathilda may's ethereal and savage naked beauty is very apparent through out the whole movie a bizarre movie and cost a lot by the time it was made br br this could have been a bigger classic with a better script but unfortunately it wasn't a great hit i think it actually flopped quite bad br br so something went wrong with this one but still it's very entertaining
<START> teenager tamara jenna dewan has it rough she's ridiculed by all the popular kids for being shy bookish frumpy and because of her interest in witchcraft all of the football players and cheerleaders are especially angry at her for writing an article on steroid abuse for the school paper on top of this her dad's a drunk her mom's not around and she's secretly in love with her supportive english teacher matthew marsden the popular kids set up a cruel prank to humiliate her accidentally kill her during a struggle bury the body in the woods and make a pact to keep silent to their shock the very next day tamara walks back into the classroom looking seductive and uh dressed to kill yep back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against everyone involved she also takes time out to make her sexually abusive pop eat a beer bottle and tries to seduce her english teacher away from his wife claudette mink a guidance counselor at the school br br acting and writing are strictly mediocre you can also tell the people responsible for this have seen such movies as carrie 1976 hello mary lou prom night ii 1987 and the craft 1996 because it borrows wholesale from all three of those superior films there's some gore a guy cutting off his ear and tongue and then stabbing his eyeball probably being the best bit a nasty vomiting scene and a few campy witty one liners not an awful film by any means but not much originality went into it either
<START> first off i'll give this movie a low scoring 4 out of 10 it was nothing more than a wannabe film i felt very let down watching this film i was lead to people it would be more drama and more facts about the true story it's based on instead i spent over an hour watching middle aged mean break the law and take drugs br br it's like football factory but with no real storyline and not a good ending after watching the film i was left wondering what was that film all about if you like films with no real storyline and a lot of drug taking and swearing then this is the film for you br br i'm a big fan of mob and gangster movies but this film did not live up to the hype i can see where the writer was trying to go with the film but it never reached it's destination one of the worst british films that i have ever watched if only the movie had more of a storyline this would have bad an excellent movie
<START> i saw this film from 1918 recently at our local film archive it seems that the danish film institute has reconstructed it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of which was one of the largest in the world in the early 20th century i believe there are several copies with english translations circulating around europe at the moment br br i found the film fascinating and the trip to mars well thought out the plot line is certainly original but i really don't want to reveal any more of it at the moment as now the danger of spoiling things for you really exists br br the film is also available on dvd query the danish film institute det web pages at dk with to get more info
<START> my main criticism with the movie is the animation i totally agree with everyone else it was very poor some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than they did in the first film which is much better also the background colours looked rushed and somewhat static it is also a shame that michael j fox didn't voice milo he did such a good job and james arnold taylor wasn't sure whether he was supposed to sound like milo or aladdin i have also taken into consideration the lack of a good storyline the third story was confusing and clumsily told and the second story suffered from poor scripting to make things worse the first one i can't even remember other than a fishing village being haunted or something like that however there was some nice music and good voice talents from john mahoney cree summer clancy brown and tom wilson that saved the film from total disaster all in all a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good film 4 10 bethany cox
<START> to sum it up in a nutshell this film was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutes br br the acting was sub par the only decent actors of the bunch being the killer and molly the music was slightly lame but fitting and the special effects were much too overused the story scriptwriting was poor the unnecessary torture romantic scenes being dragged on for way too long and a disappointing ending br br the start of the film was rather slow the fake looking gore not much of interest arrived at the house and there was some premise for a good storyline br br started to receive the threatening phone calls which heightened the suspense this momentary suspense the best feature of the movie began to build but then the friends crashed the place wrecking all potential suspense horror in the film br br the plot then becomes obtuse from here on chemistry sparks between the two couples and then the killer picks off frank and the other girl this scene was dragged on and unnecessary br br the killer then makes her way for and ties her up there is an overdone torture scene which goes on for at least ten minutes too long as the gore is done badly this is not entertaining at all and it bores more than shocks br br in summary the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising but then poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruins this film br br 3 10
<START> writer director john milius takes a little known incident from american history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways the result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable larger than life roles sean connery as the wily arab sheik with an inexplicable scottish brogue and brian keith as president theodore roosevelt itching for the chance to put that big stick to good use br br aided immeasurably by billy williams' glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable jerry goldsmith this early effort seemed the harbinger of a talent to rank with contemporaries lucas coppola and spielberg although milius served up tantalizing glimpses of his ability in scripts for johnson and apocalypse now his career seemed to take a downward turn not long after he started directing ultimately foundering on dreck like conan the barbarian and red dawn br br here's hoping that he will again find his way
<START> the summary is only for those who hate this movie as finding the movie ok or average is acceptable visiting this movie on imdb has made me nostalgic as i can't help myself going back in the year 1994 i was one of the few lucky ones who saw this movie in theaters it instantly became one of my favourite comedies and took some years to make it my favourite how can i say what made this movie my favourite was it the excellent writing story was ok but screenplay and dialogues were fabulous was it the superlative performances was it the mood of the film br br after thinking about it for so many years i say it has to be a mixture it is one of those movies which didn't have any flaws not even its music the other movie coming up in my mind right now is sholay br br ps rajkumar santoshi please keep a balance between your drama and comedy movies only 1 comedy is not enough i want
<START> wow after the first five minutes of watching this film i was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain and end my life it's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about i honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement the film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm i normally don't have a problem with movies are shoddily made 16mm films but this was just so awful and where did they find these actresses i have seen some bad acting but this takes the cake watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what i mean bci entertainment should be for distributing this god awful sludge this has to be the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of viewing i want my 74 minutes back if you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes without either shooting your tv or committing mass homicide then give a shot after all what have you got to lose
<START> this movie wasted my time i saw only part of it and i was crying about the wasted time that i could of spent doing something productive and useful towards this earth for everyone that has watched this movie more than once i am blaming them for global warming as the the amount of black balloons that got entered into the earth from this piece of crap were not needed and if they came from a different movie i would have forgiven them robin williams lowered his standards to actually participate for more than 10 seconds in this film and tim robbins how he went from this film to the redemption i have no idea please do not watch this movie for the safety of the earth stop releasing black balloons into the earth from a film that they should have never funded or released please burn all copies before anyone else has to watch this crap
<START> snakes on a train starts as mexican couple brujo a j castro alma julia ruiz cross the boarder into the us they then illegally board a seventeen hour train to los angeles however family didn't approve of her relationship placed an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her insides into snakes ain't life a b tch as the snakes pour out of mouth slither away to other parts of the train they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual ailment br br edited directed by the brothers although the imdb claims it's just one guy using a pseudonym peter one has to say that i thought snakes on a train was crap it's as simple as that really it seems the entire film was set up made to cash in on the samuel l jackson cult flick snakes on a plane 2006 by every horror fans least favourite production company the asylum who specialise in ripping off big budget hollywood flicks that style of money film making is no more evident than here with snakes on a train making a film just because the title rhymes with a more successful film is not a good starting point the script by eric is rubbish for a start snakes on a plane was great fun whereas snakes on a train is a lot more serious when you actually break it down look at it this should have been much more light hearted in fact it probably would have worked better as an scary movie 2000 type spoof you know something i am struggling to find one positive thing to say about snakes on a train it's that bad for a start the character's are rubbish it's impossible to emote with anyone the story is downright awful makes no sense if people spew all those small snakes up where did the huge ones come from why did alma turn into the giant snake at the end why did kill the train driver how was he going to stop the train once it reached los angeles where did that typhoon come from at the end it takes itself far too seriously the first seventy odd minutes is so boring uneventful i am surprised i stayed awake it's just a very very poor film on just about every level br br director only has a few train carriage car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive dull to watch there's barely any blood or gore there are some snakes borrowing under a few peoples skin someone gets shot that's about it the special effects are rubbish too the giant cgi snake at the end is truly awful the least said about it the better it's not scary there's zero atmosphere it's a bit of a bore from start to finish the real live snakes are a problem too they are just so docile nonthreatening if you look at any scene featuring a real snake an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act aggressively in fact always appear to want to slither away in the opposite direction br br shot in california technically the film is obviously low budget it show's basically it looks cheap because it is the acting isn't great not that the actor's are given any sort of material to work with br br snakes on a train is rubbish i am sorry but that's how i feel i don't quite know how else to describe it i really can't see what anyone would get out of watching snakes on a train it really is that bad
<START> i recently had the pleasure of meeting mr hauer at the 2005 film festival for the u s premier of this film not only was he gracious enough to autograph my copy of blade runner he took the time to answer some questions about the film before screening the room for a packed theatre br br i was so impressed by the film that i used it as the yardstick by which to compare all other films i had seen at the festival it was powerful and moving yet subtle and brief the film tells the story of how a young man older version played by rutger one day finds himself entranced by a seemingly ordinary room in an unremarkable building near the street walking by he notices a single window always open from which a haunting melody can be heard each day he passes by the room sometimes standing for hours outside watching it through the silken drapes that flutter in the light breeze hoping to get a glimpse of its occupants towards the end of the film we find out how significant this room really is and what has drawn our protagonist to it br br the film was cut beautifully not a second of screen time was wasted on an uninteresting shot any single frame from the film could stand alone in an art gallery rutger is amazing he is mysterious yet approachable his dialogue encompasses a series of reflections on a life that has run it's course for better or worse his words conjure familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience i was particularly moved by a scene in which he is looking at some old photos remembering his favourite dog his favourite horse and his first love you get the feeling that you are in his presence as he allows you into his world to glimpse precious memories of a life that is nearing its end br br i loved this film and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something fresh intelligent and moving should be required viewing for all film majors
<START> bill paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra ordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti catholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds br br the acting is exemplary throughout stephen is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is shia who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class franco irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slap stick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears br br a old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie
<START> the reason i am reviewing this is that the previous review was written by someone who walked out of this film not even half way through unfortunately for him he missed out on a film of tremendous beauty agreed the film was very slow to start in fact the friend i was with fell asleep briefly i woke him before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience thankfully the film developed from there into a story of love drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental 60s fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look to the film that gave it a real authentic feel be patient like many great films its well worth the wait and is certainly a film that i will look forward to revisiting 8 10
