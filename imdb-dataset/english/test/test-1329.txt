<START> venice in jews are separated from the good christians a young but poor venetian loves the fair who is a wealthy heiress so he approaches his friend a merchant called antonio for three thousand to travel to belmont and propose all of antonio's ships and merchandise are busy at sea so he turns to the shylock the one of jewish faith shylock does not like antonio for he spat on his face he offers antonio a three month loan at no interest but if he will not pay the money in that time he will own a pound of his flesh also daughter jessica elopes with the christian lorenzo the merchant of venice is based on william shakespeare's play that's believed to have written between and i read the play last summer and now i've seen the movie made in 2004 by michael radford i liked the play and i don't quite agree with the accusations of it being anti semitic the jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster even though he's ready to cut a piece of antonio's flesh there's a lot of depth in his character which all comes out in his speech where he asks if you prick us do we not bleed and so forth there is much more human in character than in one of antonio's who spits on the good jew al pacino is unbeatable as shylock he gives such a strong performance jeremy irons is also terrific as antonio lynn collins is most beautiful and brilliant in the role of robinson does great job as jessica and charlie cox as lorenzo is also very good kris marshall plays and he does a good job in the role of we see heather goldenhersh mackenzie crook plays as in shakespeare plays usually also this one contains most brilliant dialogue the movie paints a fantastic portray of the era it deals with some great issues in a shakespearian way
<START> surprising witty funny and totally engaging the film grabs a little known reality that of the student that goes studying in an erasmus program the beginning is great as the story kicks off of course it has a few lulls on the midsection and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character but the viewer won't bother the movie is young fresh and light hearted even though i don't agree with the notion that when you do erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe but that's just me the movie is deep and at the same time very light cool and recommendable
<START> i am a fan of ed harris' work and i really had high expectations about this film having so good actors as harris and von sydow is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do i really think that needful things is the worst movie of harris' filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake anyway i've seen much worse movies in my life but needful things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent the story as an overall seems too unbelievable and fake i don't know if that is because of the book 'cause i haven't read it but if the script was so bad i can't see the reason for filming it maybe it was the commercial success of king's books or the need for low quality movies for the vhs era of the 90's whatever the reason was though this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved
<START> why was this movie made are producers so easily fooled by sadists that they'll give them money to create torture methods such as this so called film i love a bad movie as much as the next masochist but cave dwellers is pushing it it's seriously physically painful to watch the plot is something about a dude name ator a buffed up whom i will refer to as private snowball for the rest of this review who has to fight invisible warriors and rescue a princess in order to beat the bad guy who needs to find a better hair stylist i might have gotten the plot wrong since it's been a while since i watched this excrement but really do you care that much oh yeah private snowball also has a mute asian sidekick who hasn't who's not funny br br anyway private snowball fights invisible people visits some caves all in the name of a good king so personality free he makes al gore look like jim carrey then private snowball builds a hang glider yes i'm serious and gets the girl kee yay it's cheap unintentionally silly and mind numbingly dull why am i not surprised that the director ended up making porn br br bottom line avoid ator will steal a part of your life and you will have no funny so bad they're good catchphrases to take with you from the experience bad ator bad gags
<START> this movie was obviously made with a very low budget but did they have to make it so obvious it looked like they made no effort to make the future look in the least futuristic for example the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's i assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than 500 additionally its pretty obvious that don the dragon is driving his personal car during the movie after all he did partially fund the film finally they point out at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new cyberpunk society not only does this never become important in the film but later when don needs surgery without anesthesia why doesn't he just go out and get some legal heroin or morphine the whole movie is sloppy like this and completely anticlimactic since don easily blows up an unstoppable about 25 minutes into the movie however if you find this movie cheap or free i'd watch it the last scene is almost worth putting up with this whole film
<START> this isn't quite the best canadian film ever imo i won't get off track and name 3 or 4 better just a couple of nights before i'd seen the bicycle thief the highly rated italian classic and there are some parallels both filmmakers shot their film in a specific time and specific place with minimal resources in terms of sets and cast and the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to watch for the realistic setting and characters alone the lingering shots over faces and landscape almost make this worth watching on its own that being said this one isn't quite in the same league as the italian classic the movie is shot in a frigid barren quebec asbestos mining town that is contrasted with the warmth of the people and the eye of the filmmaker claude jutra basically what you get is a series of vignettes that are likely nostalgic recollections of jutra not ha ha funny but poignant and probably sometimes difficult at the time but now warmed over with the of nostalgia the movie meanders there is little tension somewhere around half to two thirds way through the story begins everyone you've met to this point is involved and you've gotten to know these characters rather well so have a little patience at the outset the story is a good one it will leave you thinking and it involves sex love and death all the basic elements if you like bergman godard truffaut all that kind of stuff you won't be disappointed by this
<START> it's one of the best movies that i have seen this year i don't agree with the person who said it's boring of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all but personally i spent a very good moment this movie very well sex scenes with frightening scenes there is also a nice touch of humor for example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games d very funny i recommend this movie to everyone and by the way sorry for my poor english i'm from france
<START> i am so happy not to live in an american small town because whenever i'm shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless in this movie a former doctor who's just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash directs his steps to the nearest small town he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns which happens to be the purgatory flats and of course as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose he meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her but there is a tiny handicap she is already married to a very small time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself i'll just tell you that it's slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but is a way down in all artistic properties
<START> i'd heard a lot of bad things about this film before seeing it but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the film's low budget and poor acting both of which i can deal with when it comes to zombie films however what i didn't count on is this film being really really boring if there's one thing you can count on from low budget zombies its gore and entertainment but unfortunately this film has neither i'm quite surprised because the previous two horror films i've seen from director bob clark and black christmas were both highly inventive and entertaining films but children shouldn't play with dead things just doesn't cut it the plot line follows a group of young adults that travel to a burial island in order to mess about with rituals to bring the dead back to life however they soon learn that playing with things they don't understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood br br the plots sounds like it could lead to a decent flick but what i didn't mention is that the interesting parts don't start until the final twenty minutes and as this is a ninety minute movie i'm sure you can guess that this isn't a good thing the opening hour and ten minutes are padded out with poor acting and even worse characters i can understand setting up a situation so that the horror is more potent once it comes along but please if you're going to spend so long on it you've really got to make it interesting all of the characters in the film are over the top and annoying and personally i just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them the film is not without its merits however as the atmosphere is a standout lucio fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh eating zombies can blend well but bob clark already did it with this film the direction isn't bad either but it's brought down by poor make up effects and a distinct lack of blood which isn't likely to please fans of zombie movies overall i really can't recommend this film but if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic you may get a kick out of it
<START> there is a lot of repetitive dialogue in this movie about cold spots signaling the presence of a ghost and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves to recreate the feeling of the movie i shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review seen worse movies than the st experiment but this may be the most forgettable one of all it's getting cold basically some 20 somethings spend the night at a haunted house this is filmed as a supposedly true documentary it's obviously not real but the house does contain some cold spots spoilers as if you won't be able to predict most of the plot not much happens in this film we have the time honored horror cliche of a cat jumping out of hiding near the beginning as a practice scare to warm up the audience the people wander around with flashlights occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they come in peace that they mean no harm to the spirits or cold spots within now and then a door will swing shut and startle somebody of course the board makes an appearance they chat with a ghost named charles a girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach in it more cold spots another door swings shut and some guy goes off about the sound of the door he says oh my god somebody says surround yourself with white light i admit there is a good scene in the attic where a chair is knocked over by a ghost that really caught me off guard but aside from some funny bad dialogue the chair scene the actual split second when it is knocked over nothing immediately before or after that moment is the only good thing in this movie however there are still some cold spots in here eventually the movie ends nobody dies no more details necessary i wasn't a big fan of blair witch project but it looks like a masterpiece next to the st experiment you may find yourself not debating whether or not this is a real documentary but whether or not it was intended to be funny i still don't know but whatever it was intended to be it failed
<START> i didn't buy this i didn't rent this it was on ppv and someone burned a copy of it and loaned it to me so at least i wasted no money on it for someone that did darkness the nameless devil's backbone this is a pretty lame film seems to have something to do with a bunch of girls that were at a convent back in the day and now they're all grown up and they're being pursued and killed one by one by a nun that comes out of the kitchen sink the toilet and even manages to negotiate the revolving doors in a hotel and what makes this nun so mean and nasty and wet i dunno this was so boring that at some point about halfway through i just stopped it put it away and watched something else wasn't even interested in finding out really oh sure there's some lovely young ladies to look at but hey are two of them lesbians i guess there's a picture on the bedside table of one young lady's bedroom and what self respecting horror movie wouldn't be complete these days without a lesbian couple yeah whatever 2 out of 10 if you want to see a worthwhile nun horror movie try desecration dead waters or the convent and that's the one with adrienne barbeau by the way not the one with john malkovich
<START> someone said that webs is a lot like an episode of sliders and i have to agree spoilers i never liked the actors on sliders and rarely have seen it except when nothing better was on webs is the kind of movie to see if you have no other choices read a book webs has those kind of tv has been actors that look like they are there as part of their probation or work release program some low budget tv movies have actors that at least look enthusiastic the actors in webs look like they were getting paid minimum wage and were working on a time clock they have that desperate the paycheck better not bounce look the queen spider looks great except it is rarely seen and there are no other spiders and no webs the queen spider bites people and they become spider zombies which means that they try to keep their eyes wide open when they are attacking the humans the humans are all fighting among themselves over a number of different reasons and they are not sympathetic after meeting all the humans i would have recommended charm school for the characters all that webs made me feel was apathy i was numb to the characters and hoped for some interesting gore and special effects the gore was minimal and the special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen who looked good if webs had a bunch of spider creatures eating humans it would have been more entertaining apparently they could only budget spider zombies webs is a sad entry into the field of spider oriented movies it may qualify as the worst spider movie ever because eight legged freaks had great special effects
<START> warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment br br if you plan on watching this movie don't i warn you this movie is terribly boring and basically horrifying not in the horror movie kind of way to watch i mistook this piranha movie for another piranha movie and when i had noticed i made a mistake i decided to watch this one anyway i wish i wouldn't have this movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that i couldn't bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent for one thing this movie should be called a boring talk about wilderness instead of piranha they only show piranhas once at the same time the way this film sounds so poorly heard i got sleepy only 20 minutes into the thing at the end my mouth was hung wide open and i stared gloomily at the blank tv screen it is a very poorly directed and badly filmed piece of junk that i was afraid i brain dysfunction after watching it
<START> i didn't expect too much from this movie but i was still disappointed it's supposed to be a comedy but there are only four or five scenes where i actually laughed and i think that's rather poor there is no real plot either i always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been put anywhere in the movie because there's no connection between them but the worst thing was the acting of kim franke he has one facial expression during the whole movie as if he was supposed to play some retarded guy but i believe that's not the case all in all i rate it four out of ten i've seen worse movies than this but i wouldn't spend money on this one again
<START> filmed in arizona by a mostly foreign crew is one of the crime dramas i have ever seen robert mitchum in a cowboy hat trails recently widowed jaclyn smith around hoping to figure out if she had a hand in her husband's death wardrobe is of the dale evans variety and her dog is named cowboy seems as if somebody sure bought into the american myth that all westerners talk and dress like descendants of john wayne screenplay by joan andre and john case may have worked better if approached as parody this mystery thriller just plays tame with director ted post asleep at the controls don't be drawn in by the video box art of jaclyn screaming while taking a shower she does indeed take a shower in this film but it is not revealing nor does it further the murky plot one iota no stars from
