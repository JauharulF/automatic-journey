<START> for those curious this episode is based in theme upon play six characters in search of an author and jean paul sartre's play no exit as indicated most obviously by its title but of course with a sterling twist br br five very different individuals find themselves in a round room with no idea who they are other than the indication of their attire a bell intermittently rings perhaps also a hemmingway allusion increasing the agony of their incarceration the newcomer to the group a major is determined to escape while the others are resigned to their fate br br unlike these characters don't even have a story they have nothing other than the experience of the room in their consciousness and no one to author their nonexistent story so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in piece unlike both and sartre there is no relationship involved between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them though the theme of personal responsibility versus apathy is prominent in this story br br though this diverges significantly from the storyline of the authors alluded to in the title themes of sartre and and many other authors of the twentieth century come through with absolute clarity this is very obviously a piece which addresses post modernist perspective in the context of the cold war era there is also an emphasis upon issues of personal insignificance br br this is easily one of the best episodes i've seen and still exceptionally relevant to current experience as are sartre and exactly what makes a good piece of writing into a classic
<START> twenty years later this movie still remains as entertaining as when you first watched it in a movie market overrun by toilet humor graphic violence and foul language it's refreshing to be fully entertained for two hours by such a clean movie
<START> the subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but 'the cure' successfully portrays the idea that it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom and if anything children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end it is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood br br the film sees erik a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother moving into a new area where their next door neighbour is eleven year old dexter who contracted aids through a blood transfusion after his initial fears and ignorance over aids are erik befriends dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the mississippi to where they have heard about a new orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease br br the talent from the two young leads of brad and joseph who play erik and dexter respectively is exceptional brad was able to portray erik's harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to dexter's character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that his illness doesn't mean he still isn't a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven year old boy the pair's interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well annabella sciorra also delivers a touching performance as dexter's mother linda who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother figure to the other boy br br set against an excellent soundtrack 'the cure' is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes a very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with dexter's aids status whereas the children even the come to accept him as they would any other what is also very touching is how despite erik's streetwise nature he is the more naive one in his determination to cure dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend's enthusiasm for a cure br br i highly recommend 'the cure' for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting
<START> apart from the fact that this film was made i suppose it seemed a good idea at the time considering bottom was so popular the one thing that puzzled me about guest house paradiso was what happened to the lighting there is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film whatsoever and i watched it on network tv so it wasn t a case of watching a dodgy tape in fact the film was shot so darkly it was impossible to see what the hell was going on but if the dialogue was anything to go by that s maybe not a bad thing
<START> over the past century there have been many advances in gender equality but not so much in the world of movies i'm not talking about what goes on behind the camera i'm referring to the tastes of the audience the idea of a chick flick is alive and well today while there are still plenty of action and horror films which appeal primarily to males sure there are men and women who enjoy the movies that fall outside of their typical demographic but there aren't many movies which have appeals across the board hitch the latest will smith vehicle attempts to change that trend by being a chick flick which throws in a dose of male perspective br br smith stars in hitch as the title character alex hitch hitchens a date doctor who trains men on how to approach a woman and have a successful date hitch enjoys his job and loves to see men successfully accomplish their goals of going out with the woman of their dreams but due to a bad experience in college hitch himself is somewhat sullied on the idea of love as the story unfolds the film introduces two seemingly separate story lines hitch's latest case is albert kevin james an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients the beautiful heiress cole amber hitch has his doubts about albert's chances but if his clients desires seem sincere hitch supports them br br in the mean time hitch meets gossip columnist sara eva mendes and is instantly attracted to this strong woman however the date doctor can't seem to follow his own advice in pursuing sara things get even more complicated when sara's job leads her to investigate the relationship between the accountant and the heiress will hitch be able to balance his private life and his job and more importantly can hitch believe in love again if you are a true movie fan then there's been at least one time in your life when you've complained about the redundancy of the hollywood movie factory and cried out for something new and original well hitch ain't that movie but most movie fans will also admit that occasionally a formulaic movie can work solely on an entertainment level hitch does qualify as that film
<START> the problem with this movie is that it isn't funny it isn't scary it isn't dramatic it isn't intriguing it isn't stimulating it isn't it isn't exciting it isn't even the slightest bit interesting i saw this film recently on tape and i was glad i didn't spent any money to rent it it's basically a poor attempt at film making i won't even bother to tell you the story story what story
<START> a very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution ian mcshane is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets canned because he won't go along with the program and sets out to let the world know what they're missing the supporting cast is great as well and the music is the soul of the film i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library
<START> first of all i hardly ever watch swedish movies and this is actually the second time in my life i watch a swedish movie on cinema therefor i believe it's one of the best swedish movies ever the combination of thrill and humour is outstanding and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh the plot is about this man a writer who wants to go to germany after world war ii and help the germans to start over on the way to germany he is trying to help his friends on the train which is however a bad idea what a clumsy jerk and poor robert the wounded soldier always get in the way ouch but he still got his great mood a positive guy robert have done some less great movies the last years or so and this is really a relief he is great in this movie after all this is one of the best swedish movies ever and peter dalle has made an excellent job congratulations
<START> what a nasty cynical film apparently this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20 year olds do whilst crawling through the gutter of sydney nightlife is supposed to be somehow connecting with its target market made by some industry nobody and pals who seemingly thought they could together any sleazy behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes sample people deservedly failed miserably at the australian box office it is so offensive in its clichÃ©d depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended shoddy and cruel and with no attempt to offer quality or resonance to the young audience who might have been attracted by the marketing or casting sample people might have been interesting or even informative if not botched by its exploitive view of 'what teens want to see in a movie' the character played by ben is particularly offensive and kylie minogue is again wasted by poor material and untalented film makers it is as if the producers thought teens would watch any ugly trash and just together scenes and characters who were shallow and soul less well the were very wrong a mini budget film made in 1983 called going down got this topic right and is an excellent antidote to this poison
<START> scarecrow gone wild starts as high school teenager mike david zelina his mates decide to to give a to wimpish diabetic sam caleb as an initiation of some sort mike his mate decide to take sam to a corn field tie him to a cross next to a freaky looking scarecrow leave him there all night sounds like fun right well things backfire when sam goes into a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo the vengeful spirit of sam passes into the scarecrow which comes to life starts to hunt down the kids responsible for sam's unfortunate life threatening predicament can sam's best mate jack matthew his girlfriend beth samantha aisling save the day sam's life br br written directed by brian scarecrow gone wild is the third straight to video entry in the scarecrow series while i haven't seen either of the previous two after seeing scarecrow gone wild i'm certainly in no hurry to change that situation that's for sure the script actually has an almost decent premise as the wronged soul of sam seeks revenge his friends have to keep the real sam alive somehow but the way it is told is poor i suppose that basically it's just an irrelevance to the fact that this is a film about a killer scarecrow running around killing people in not very gory or imaginative ways having said that there are one or two scenes here which save it from a one star rating the fart gag in the corn field is funny something a lot of immature blokes might do like me the bit when two guys bury their mate in the sand then stand over him pee on him is also rather funny in a laddish juvenile way a cool bit when some guy starts singing an awful song so the scarecrow throws a pole which impales him however these ok bits are few far between as a whole it's a silly boring poorly written teen slasher film with highly annoying character's who irritate it' also very predictable has a stupid twist ending which doesn't really feature the scarecrow at all which is a problem as when you watch a film called scarecrow gone wild you expect to see a scarecrow go wild i have to admit he looks quite cool as horror character's go br br director does a reasonable job here actually although what on earth is up with that hospital at the end all that neon lighting everywhere the fact there is only one patient there two members of staff the cinematography is much better than the usual straight to video low budget horror film of late there's some nice if totally unrealistic lighting the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an dependant diabetic myself there's not much gore here there's a couple of scenes where some actor has some fake guts placed on their stomach to represent them being gutted but it looks pretty fake there's also a burned face a couple of but little else there's a fair amount of naked female breasts on show if that's your thing br br technically scarecrow gone wild is pretty good considering some of the low budget abominations i've sat through recently unfortunately it's still a poor film overall the least said about the acting the better br br scarecrow gone wild isn't as bad as some of the straight to video horror crap that's been turning up recently but having said that it's not that much better it's still a bad film when all said done not recommended the two previous entries are scarecrow 2002 scarecrow slayer 2003 both of which also went straight to video
<START> i was turned on to this movie by my flight instructor and now i wonder how the heck it was out there for nearly five years before i finally discovered it if you have any love of flying at all especially an attachment to the planes of wwii this is an absolute must see vastly superior to the pathetic pearl harbor and up there in rivalry with the famed battle of britain filmed more than thirty years ago there are moments when you feel as if you are flying literally dodging the shell casings of your leader as you roll in on a me 109 or he 111 br br as an historian this film deeply touched me as well for it is about the plight endured by tens of thousands of gallant poles hungarians and czechs who in 1939 1940 fled their homelands made it to england fought with utmost bravery for the survival of western civilization and then were so callously abandoned by us after the war when they were arrested by the communists upon their return to their native lands i have stood atop monte in italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery for the polish troops that stormed that mountain that british and americans could not take i have traveled as well to prague the most beautiful of cities and studied their history their story of abandonment i believe should be a lesson to us even today about obligations to gallant allies br br but back to the film if you love flying see this if you are interested in the aircraft of wwii most definitely see it without doubt the most brutal direct and frightfully swift air combat scenes ever replicated for film and yes if you even are seeking a touching romance there is that as well in heartbreaking detail br br bill professor of history co owner of a wwii replica p 51 mustang gloria ann
<START> i didn't know much about this movie going in my roommate kind of dragged me into it i was so pleasantly surprised the plot really grabbed my attention and held it and the characters are well drawn and realistic the screenplay is very clever and funny and the cast does great things with it and the best part is that it managed to be entertaining without any explicit sex or violence if this movie comes anywhere into your area you really should go see it stand up for this little film it is worth it
<START> this movie might be o k if not for all the language in it i think that the storyline itself isn't bad but i would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids see the movie i know that kids will learn all the swear words along the way eventually that's true but parents should not assist them in the process by letting them see and hear the stuff in the guise of entertainment br br i used to quite like robert loggia he has a distinctive gritty quality with that rough voice of his but in the last few years all i have seen him do are roles with a lot of language in them if we had an award for over use of the f word he would have to be a contender unfortunately i think he's now lost me as a fan when i see his name on movies in future i will be thinking twice about picking up that title br br look i'm no prude i use language sometimes too in extreme circumstances but when we're watching a movie it is for the sake of e n t e r t a i n m e n t something which we hope will bring us some joy and escapism i do not want to be reminded of what's happening out on the streets in any big city these days and it's a hassle to have to wonder whether or not a movie is alright for my family to watch br br i like matt modine too but it's a pity that he has associated himself with a picture which has let his image down like this he probably did an o k job in the movie but i turned off about 1 4 of the way through after having had my ears assaulted once too often by others in the cast why can't these actors just say no when these scripts ask them to carry on with this gutter language once enough actors especially the big names kick up a fuss about it the writers will stop putting it in the movies br br i'm sorry but i cannot recommend this picture it's a pity too because i think it would probably have been alright if it had been made well enough for decent families to watch thank god i only wasted 2 00 on it
<START> cactus flower was a delightful 1969 comedy based on a neil simon play about a dentist walter matthau having an affair with a young free spirited woman goldie hawn totally unaware that his devoted nurse assistant ingrid bergman is in love with him matthau can play this kind of role in his sleep and he doesn't disappoint as the philandering dentist dr julian winston who is dating one woman but really has no clue that he's in love with another goldie hawn won an oscar for her sparkling performance as toni simmons the aging flower child who slowly comes to realize she is trapped in a dead end affair and is not as dim as she appears on the surface but the real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of the legendary ingrid bergman as stephanie dickinson dr winston's completely devoted assistant who is willing to to bury and sacrifice her own happiness as long as dr winston is happy with tony bergman is luminous in this film looking absolutely beautiful though the camera has always loved her and showing an unforeseen knack for light comedy yes the dialogue and the settings are slightly dated but the story is timeless and the performances by the stars make it imminently watchable
<START> the opening credits are pure poetry and i have watched it several times it had a corny 20's adventure feel to it of course kathy is gorgeous but that voice did she realize this was a talkie one word voice coach great film for chronic insomnia along with a bottle of scotch
