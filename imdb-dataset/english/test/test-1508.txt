<START> it used to be that video distributors like sub rosa and brain damage films would release low budget shot on video horror films to a select market of gorehounds that ate them up with glee that's acceptable to me because you could see these movies from a mile away with their shoddy box art and cheesy titles br br now we have lions gate getting into the mix only they have decided that it'd be better to sucker in poor saps by putting a professional looking cover on it and charge the same price as one of their higher budget professionally made features do not be suckered in by this granted if you've seen dark harvest 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3 but there is a place for movies like this and it is not on a video store shelf beside professionally made features br br i am a fan of independent cinema and have watched several low budget shot on video productions that were still a worthy rental but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting if you can call it that was abysmal it was amusing to laugh at the horrible line reading for a minute or two but eventually it was too much to take and became unbearable the story is bad the dialogue is worse the acting somehow manages to be even worse the only possible saving grace to this would be one disemboweling scene that still manages to be awful but is an award winning effect when compared to the blood splatters after a girl is slapped or the mannequin decapitation br br it took me three tries to make it through this entire movie and i only did so because i paid good money to rent it and felt like i should at least finish it all the way through stay away stay far far away from this one
<START> a new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat lake bell is wonderful it is to bad that her other show miss match was canceled i am just glad she came back on surface i can't wait for the return of surface this show is really something unique to watch with an eerie underwater world that is akin to jurassic park this show keeps you wondering what is next is adorable even if he is going to turn into something larger and much more ominous there are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old subjects when something like surface comes along you just have to say thank you
<START> may contain spoilers i find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives while it is most certainly not perfect it is much better than it is given credit for the acting and photography are excellent some of the musical numbers are great including the title number where do i go easy to be hard and black boys white boys while i have not seen the stage musical i think that it clouds the judgement of many this is not the musical you see in theatres do not attempt to compare them the theatrical musical might have been sensational to watch but it would never have had the same effect on film so a plot had to be added and the ending that has been added is just amazing the movie left me feeling like i had actually watched something important unlike most of today's movies which only satisfy on one level
<START> this film has the worst editing i've ever seen this is yet another film to avoid at all costs unless you view it via mst3k on their website they wonder why the coast guard cooperated with this film i mean they let them use a helicopter
<START> may contain spoilers horrible just horrible i loved stephen king's novel and this is just a horrible adaptation of it they change the ending they change the plot they changed alan character from a grieving husband to a happy fiancÃ© if you are a fan of stephen king's novel stay away even if you are not stay away br br the book was awesomely dark even for steve king an 11 year old kills himself in the novel a middle school principal is found with child pornography in the novel this is nowhere near as good as the novel br br this movie is my least favorite film of all time i hate this film with a vengeance
<START> i first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an lp recording of the soundtrack i liked it so well i went back to see it several times cannot understand why it was considered a flop julie andrews was lovely in this film her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful br br the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy handed they were still fun br br i recently found i could get a copy in dvd form and ordered it i was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the dvd i ordered
<START> this is one great show that it makes me wonder why it got pulled off the air so many times but i believe its now here to stay this show cant compare to any other before simpsons was pretty on the edge and than came family guy and they are stretching it out to go off the edge the things this show gets away with is incredible totally work the watch if you like the simpsons you will love family guy
<START> my kids enjoyed the movie but i was bored there were a few good lines and a handful of funny parts but the plot was pretty lame and relied on the special effects and gadgets to pull it through still it hit the center of the bullseye that it was aiming for it was good for the kids
<START> i thought of this movie when i watched pluto nash why because both movies have randy quaid playing a retarded robot this movie made years earlier but probably written by a screenplay writer that drank the same coffee or something like that whoa avoid at all costs even to pay tribute to the late great andy kaufman is hard to do here find another film or just watch taxi reruns on tv his character is so much more loveable tank you berry much
<START> john candy and eugene levy star as inept security guards who chase down a big time mobster inept is truly the right word for this alleged comedy a few laughs but mostly groans and thoughts to yourself like why am i watching this c p yes that is meg ryan in this too which i am sure she doesnt want to be reminded of a waste of a talented cast on a scale of one to ten 0
<START> fantastic film wow this is really a treat i can't believe that i discovered such a gem of a movie br br a pretty young girl traveling south to florida meets a friendly older couple with an rv after she has a flat at a rest stop however she learns that things aren't as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with them br br everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of you br br newcomer emily grace did a fantastic job as the really cute yet somewhat shy alice emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see just how she got into the situation that develops in the film i'm sure we'll be seeing emily in more films in the future br br contrary to what some others have said the lighting and photography in this were just perfect the editing was done well too just the right way to put together images of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling along with the cast on their road trip br br i didn't see it on the big screen but i can only urge everyone to go out and see it more films like this are exactly what we need br br sf
<START> the 1970s opened the door to the largest most diverse era of film in the history some films were great the godfather the conversation mean streets chinatown the french connection five easy pieces jaws mccabe and mrs miller others were not so great the getaway the outfit badge joe the taking of pelham one two three brewster mccloud castle keep and others were barely worth the price of admission br br yet every one was a fresh breath of air compared to today's corporate hollywood where every film is given a big weekend to recoup its cost or go straight to hbo and rental br br what decade does so well is to relate the sudden and rarely experienced sensation of freedom to be given money to make and direct a film perhaps personal perhaps not sometime with a clutch of extras sometimes in the middle of a busy street before the cops show up long before the corporate suits committees and lawyers ever became part of the system br br the commentaries are superb especially julie christie and dennis hopper though as you listen you'll slowly discover just how many big directors today coppola scorsese ron howard dennis hopper peter got stated as roger corman commandos working long hours with short pay shooting a film in under a month learning all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it themselves turning in product that was on time and under budget br br see decade for its message and for a long and varied list of films to watch made through those wondrously turbulent years br br though i would not complain if ifc decided to devote another documentary solely to that most under rated grand pioneer of film roger corman
<START> 'in the line of fire' tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former government assassin turned psycho the secret service agent bodyguard eastwood is on defense and the assassin malkovich is on offense the stakes the president's live br br i really like this movie i've seen it numerous times on tv and have recently bought it on dvd yet it's not an excellent movie the plot is way too thin and the attempts to it are downright ridiculous the whole love story isn't very plausible and the way they brought an extra character into the story just to be able to kill it off is kind of insulting to the more or less intelligent viewer though i feel these mistakes can't be forgiven i can easily look past them to mr malkovich exquisite performance i've always deemed him to be a great actor but in this movie he's really on fire there's a reason why he got an academy award nomination rene russo and clint eastwood were okay but i don't deem their performance to be memorable they're never at the best of their abilities br br if you don't expect too much you'll certainly like this movie it's no masterpiece but john malkovich is really extraordinary and i don't think anyone can't enjoy his performance really worth the watch
<START> i struggle to see the point of this movie it is supposed to be a comedy but i didn't laugh once the storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie but since this is acted by comics the result is totally unbelievable as comedies should be the comic strip series was very hit and miss even withing the episodes and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things one to avoid i have also just found out that comments have to be 10 lines long the whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching not write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart if you like seinfeld larry sanders the young ones alan partridge arrested development curb red dwarf then you might like to pass on this on the other hand if you like lame jokes such as can be found in friends and dodgeball enjoy watching this
<START> last year was the 200th anniversary of charles darwin's birth and the anniversary of the publication of the origin of species so it's fitting that jon creation got released the movie focuses on the period of darwin's paul bettany life while he was writing his famous work and the mild strain that it put on his family life br br i guess that the movie overplayed darwin's tension with his religious wife emma jennifer connelly and his guilt over his deceased daughter annie but i still like the thought of darwin's theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma as it was the us was one of the last countries in which creation found a distributor due to the creationism evolution debate yes it's still going on br br all in all this isn't a masterpiece but i recommend it the same way that i recommend inherit the wind i hope that one day the creationism evolution debate won't be an issue if this film helps put the debate to rest then more power to everyone in the movie also starring martha west jeremy northam toby jones and benedict
