<START> i just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it it still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate br br i almost wrote bonnie hunt a letter to tell her how much i love it david duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real minnie driver is so natural and honest my favorite line is when duchovny says i miss elizabeth but i ache for grace oh man i'm crying just thinking about it also bonnie hunt and jim belushi are the perfect chicago area couple i know them i swear i'm related to them i'm sure br br this movie is in my three times a year rotation i'd watch it once a week but i'm afraid i'd get too used to it i always want to make it a special day when i watch it
<START> one look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills in an attempt to artificially boost this film's ratings br br this film brings nothing new to the zombie genre in fact it is laughably bad in acting and cinematography and derivative in its plot the make up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot lines are stiffly delivered and badly timed with the exception of the female bounty hunter who is the only good actor in this mess of a film the worst offenders are the italian guy hans the protagonist and the lead bad guy i've seen better delivery from pizza truck with a flat tire br br this is a self proclaimed zombie western but about the only thing that makes this a zombie western is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the lead actor's real name is clint the protagonist isn't cool and mysterious like a traditional eastwood hero and as an anti hero he doesn't have the wise cracking attitude to pull it off either br br don't be fooled by the fake glowing reviews this is just another b grade zombie movie that's competently made for the budget it had it does have some decent lighting but it reeks of low budget first time directing and bad acting there are a lot of really stupid scenes that make this look really amateurish
<START> i just watched return from lonesome dove and it was very good i've seen a lot of negative comments about it and i don't think the viewers are being real about it in the television movie business it is hard to get all the actors back for a 2nd sequel or 3rd part we are lucky to have another miniseries that ties into lone d faithfully this production was top notch with the original music score and the actors put their hearts into it you can tell if you want to watch lonesome d with robert duvall and tommy l j then watch the original return to l d didn't have as much wit and takes on a more serious tone but is totally captivating none the less from the touching moments to the villains this one is a winner wonderful
<START> i don't know how this dvd made its way into my collection my wife suggested it was one of these 3 for Â£20 deals at a high street store the thing isn't worth let alone Â£6 66 having invested heavily in it i felt duty bound to watch it to the end just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through and it was br br the dialog was awful the story line was impenetrable i still don't understand what the hell was going on despite having read the synopsis the camera work was disjointed and hopeless the acting was wooden not helped by the dialogue br br in fact there were no redeeming features no not even the lovely sandra bullock on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold she should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it asap br br as a final amusing example of the director's ineptitude there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with his father's ex army sidekick while driving this was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film no engine noise whatsoever i look forward to the engine technology eventually making its way across the pond into british cars
<START> i don't know why all of the critics say this was a bad movie this is one of my all time favorite movies tommy chris farley and richard david spade are a great match tommy is the stupid one who spent seven years in college finally passing with a d richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone in school how can you not laugh when the two of them are singing superstar by the carpenters and all of a sudden the hood pops up in all this is a great movie i recommend it
<START> if you don't have anything better to do then go ahead and rent this movie it's intelligent funny it will sure have your attention busy for a while br br i discover it by surfing channels in a boring sunday it was on cable and for the faces i saw i thought it may worth the try it made me laugh and for a movie in a sunday with nothing else on tv it was ok br br liv tyler looks amazing in the movie even though her acting is not what i expected it's kind of poor acting and for the rest of the crew i liked reba in her role as a dr also i found interesting seeing the guy from the sitcom what i like about you playing an almost gay lawyer br br as for j goodman i found it as always a very good performance michael douglas plays a small role but his characterization was hard for me to identify him br br it's also a good movie to watch with company
<START> there is a lot wrong with this movie it can be said that doing a sequel to halloween was a bad idea in the first place and we should feel lucky that the previous entries even at their lowest were still watchable but even still halloween the curse of michael myers even today is so bad it's shocking poor movie making at it's worst indeed there is so much blame to go around but where to begin whose shoulders does this blame rest on br br was it director joe style over substance directing well at the very least the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front and as far the visual effects go you get to see michael kill in some pretty gruesome ways even if it doesn't quite fit in with the overall tone of the series br br so could daniel troubled script be the culprit well to be fair he did the best he could by the time you reach the sixth entry in any series you're running out of places to go finding a rhyme to michael's reason isn't a bad concept so much as it's an uninteresting one especially the way it's handled here and it really doesn't help that the movie was hacked to pieces and sewn back together so many times that the story got completely lost towards the end br br perhaps dimension miramax could have botched the whole thing afterall this was the first studio film in the halloween series and we all know what happens when too many cooks get in the kitchen heck look at the unbelievable lows they dragged hellraiser to i guess everyone is to blame because aside from the actors and the visual effects guys it seems nobody put in the effort to deliver a decent flick br br the bottom line though is that no matter how you cut it slice it dice it or electrocute it until it's head explodes halloween the curse of michael myers was never a good film marking an all time low for the series that nearly killed off any credibility for michael myers curse is just that cursed the thorn angle was never interesting nor was it probably expanded upon the needless gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the halloween name towards the end the movie stops making sense stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and end the film before anything else is lost it's sad that donald pleasence's final performance is immortalized in this film even if the man did the best he could under the worst possible conditions and for the most part there's other strong cast members in this film paul rudd plays the weird anti social adult tommy doyle rather naturally while marianne hagan does a fair job at portraying the sympathetic female lead on the other side of the coin the re casting of jamie lloyd was a shame and thank god devin gardner doesn't do movies anymore as the child in the film being pursued by the man in black danny is the anti jamie in that he is annoying whiny and absolutely unbelievable in his role it's sad when you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror film but i guess that's halloween 6 in a nutshell essentially this is the anti halloween made by a director who didn't know what he was doing and a studio that had their own agenda hell even the music is bad many will try to paint this as the edgy halloween because of it's sci fi twist but really it's just stupid save for some good visuals and decent characters the curse of michael myers is just about as bad as it gets and this is coming from a fan
<START> i liked half life i am still it's fan it was frightening intelligent and challenging i don't tell any news it is one the best fps ever made maybe i'm too hardcore half life fan but the so called half life 2 is not half life 2 br br and i have a question is this the next chapter of half life maybe the creators valve thinks so but i don't where are the intelligent enemies where is the frightening atmosphere nowhere i believe they wanted to make a bit different half life instead of another research station story but they didn't just made a very different one they made something that has to do with half life like for example quake does to doom the entire game so unsightly and unreal that it's almost forlorn br br though the physics are truly great and there were a few good level to play the idea to make a revolutionary driven gameplay has utterly failed when you get the gravity gun that can move objects you can expect with rights to use it as a weapon that would turn the schematic fps gameplay upside down the truth is you can't use gravity gun as a real weapon why because the best you can do is throwing boxes and barrels that don't do much damage if you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it can fall from about 3 shots if you want to throw an exploding barrel to your enemy it can explode in your own hand the gravity gun doesn't work as a weapon the best usage is solving some puzzles i ask valve why the truth is you must use your boring schematic fps weapons to the end except for last level weapons are not that made original half life a classic if gravity gun would be always like at the last level a real weapon i'd admire what valve did but not this this is disappointing br br so if you want half life then you are searching at the wrong place maybe you will enjoy it but i repeat it is everything but not half life and even not a faithful continuation of that this is the greatest disappointment of all time valve have shown they can make awful games too they have managed that
<START> i don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad it was great classic bruce campbell yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a bruce movie for you watch it for bruce also ted was excellent i found this movie hilarious and entertaining i still crack up when i recall bruce on that pink moped now i will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like b movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear but if you like slap stick and off the wall sci fi plots this movie is for you br br hail the king baby
<START> there are so many things wrong with this movie i don't even know where to begin the story is not cohesive at all i guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his her head in confusion br br here's what i remember of the movie before i was bored into unconsciousness a quasi abusive dad chases some pre teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all in the next scene the girls are about 15 they're driving with their parents and hit a deer the deer must have been explosive because their car blows up one sister drags the other from the burning wreckage then the girls are drifting in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to kentucky and start a new life in the very next scene the girls are hitchhiking toward a military base and what a military base it is actually it's more like a hog farm converted to look like a military base with plenty of confused extras playing soldiers the base office is particularly awesome because there are random things like an ak 47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat mounted to a plaque so the audience is sure to know that this is a military guy's office then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go into town to buy some porn mags and to make sure the soldiers don't think that he's on the pink team so our character takes a pickup converted to look like an army truck to town and loads up a box from a nondescript book store with a blowup doll by the front door the girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops to gas up and look through the porn stash to find items inside like the anal invader i guess that's enough of the plot to scare most people away plot aside the sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit during the scene where the slutty sister meets the main character for the first time or how the camera lingers way too long on certain shots to try to convey a message br br if you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever stay away it's not worth the money in either case
<START> this movie didn't do it for me an avid snl fan for the past 14 years jamie portrayal was ok but there was something so off putting about the movie itself the facts presented in the movie are totally skewed but griffin produced it so that would explain a lot he was never on snl nor had anything to do with it the points in her life when she was on snl are backwards when we first see her on snl walking through the studio with lorne michaels the logo on the wall is circa 1988 1989 not 1975 and let's talk about the cast who are these people i have never heard of a one of them truly dissatisfying this movie shows why tv movies are just that tv movies
<START> it's not a movie but an experience br br not the usual eye candy i thought it would be too many things are happening at once your senses almost couldn't handle it a product of cutting edge technology we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our 3d glasses on and off to decipher the magic the music is great it's a concert the disney characters are in it and you get to be part of their world it's funny it's magical it's exciting i know this is beginning to sound like an advertisement but it really is that awesome beats christmas in bringing out the kid in you br br this attraction alone already makes going to disney all worth it
<START> with great expectations i went to see this film spain's contribution to the oscar race this year part from being completely pointless banal pathetic badly written edited acted and directed the movie is too long it fails in delivering the message it tries to give fails in its storytelling clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm there are some so extreme misfires i haven't seen in a movie in a long time the story of lucas whose dead sister lives in his head the divine revelations all that lizard nonsense the spanish speaking audience around me was yawning and rapidly losing patience and some of the commentaries i overheard was whether the members of the spanish academy had taken drugs before choosing the film for the oscar contest
<START> kristy swanson plays an elite who is supposed to have knocked off a tv reporter for a group of bad guys but once she sees this poor fellow at home playing with his kids she decides to junk the whole project and the tv reporter's life is spared the life is up for grabs as the people who wanted this reporter killed now want her dead for not following through with her assignment such is the basis for a movie called supreme sanction br br supreme waste of time is more like it we see character beat up pummel and kill men far bigger than her and she always one two fifty steps ahead of the group of murders who can't for some reason do away with this super having one woman do away and beat all these men makes the movie seem so gay it is too predictable once you figure character is going to win out anyway thus making the film boring and inept br br kristy swanson is decent actress who in her younger days was always sexy and easy on the eyes supreme sanction is not one of her better efforts however
<START> if you are going to make a movie from any book be sure that the characters are with that book this movie not only defied the biblical story that has been told for thousands upon thousands of years to children one way or another but it clearly took liberties that no adaptation would probably ever try at least the lord of the rings is close enough to the books that people understand the story more if they read the books than this noah's ark tried to
