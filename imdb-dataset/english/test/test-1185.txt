<START> it has been since 1972 that i saw this movie and i still remember it as one of my favorite all time movies i would buy a copy if it were on dvd and it is too bad it isn't you would think that anything starring peter sellers would be brought back much better than being there and as good as the pink panther series uschi digard had a small part for such a well endowed performer she is bonus in this movie i think the medical field may not appreciate this film as it really makes fun of the profession and it also makes one appreciate that sellers was never available to treat them as his bed side manner sucked as well did his analysis of urine samples
<START> you may not believe this but when the credits to this movie rolled i looked for the director's name when i saw it i burned it into my memory and i never forgot it this movie is beyond terrible it makes ed wood's films look like orsen welles at least b movies are entertaining this was a soul deadening experience the quality was so bad i began to wonder who allowed this to happen br br i hear uwe boll runs fourteen miles a day this is because wherever his movies are viewed the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork the script was terrible the lighting was like that of a high school football game and the cinematography was just above the quality of roger bigfoot video the acting was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility in the end was a film alan smithee wouldn't have put his name on i learned that day to avoid any movie by this man despite the circumstances from what i hear this is not a bad thing to do
<START> one wonders how flynn could have failed so badly as a cinema release in 1997 with guy pearce aptly in the lead role it is not often that the casting of someone so famous is so exactly right flynn was a at the box office and did not end up on cinema screens in australia even after la confidential from a dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes presumably by guy pearce flynn gets off to a fairly robust and interesting start sadly flynn runs out of steam after about the first 35 minutes and with the entrance of hammy steven berkoff in a detour to new guinea looking and acting like he wanted the klaus kinski role in the film starts to resemble a tele movie rather than a major cinema biography believe it or not by about the 70 minute make it is boring and you are glad to see it over but such promise pearce is flynn but the movie caused a mutiny at the box office and unlike the bounty sank without trace
<START> three words piece of art this film is just great it's beautiful sad frightening and thought provoking at the same time the score constantly stays in my head the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same time br br it was more by chance than on purpose that i saw this movie at the time i decided to watch this movie i was just bored and read lists of asian films which maybe good well i saw the title a tale of two sisters which sounded very interesting then i read the summary of the plot and decided you don't just watch this film you've gotta buy it said done i bought this film and was hooked from the very first minute br br the plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end the twist near the end of the film made me scream i really didn't see something like this coming and the ending scene made me cry it just made me cry it was so sad br br well i recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is as i mentioned before a very sad one but this just fits in the mood of the film doesn't it
<START> i wrote spoiler alert but there's not really much that can be spoiled it's like spoiling rotten meat this movie is probably the worst i've ever seen not because of the actors or the special effects but because of the sheer number of mistakes both factual and physical first of all the migs aren't actually migs at all they're mirages and they're french and how the heck can dad withstand the maneuvers his son makes to fight off the migs without a g suit and why would chappy try to board his plane without a g suit and how could doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease anyway i did not like this movie and the worst part is that it has 3 sequels the latest one from as late as 1995 now that's scary
<START> i believe there are two angles to the story first it's the world satyric view presented in an obvious kafkaesque manner underlining the sordid spectacle behind some of life's most common but also pleasant or comfortable moments and elements which are usually enough to keep man functioning in society like a good job a good home a good wife a good car and even a good mistress apart from this so called common bliss there are some who cannot help asking themselves some more uncomfortable questions like where they come from or weather they can have some other form of bliss weather there could be a reason for them being or weather there could be something they missed out on or even more sinister weather there could be something the system itself is withholding from them br br second the most interesting aspect of this film i believe is the fact that it attacks head on this natural compulsion to dissect the world around us questioning it by our personal judgment and usually condemning it because it doesn't serve us better because it's not tailor made to suit us as a person br br the symbolism behind the train accident i believe suggests that our own will can be overpowered by fate or some other universal greater power even in the face of our so called power to decide when we want out instead the man gets to be dismissed by this greater power let's call it the system because the authors clearly avoid calling it god perhaps further underlining that the system is man made and therefore can be mastered by man unlike fate which is a concept closer to religion on it's own terms not by killing him but by showing him that there is a place for the man who asks wants too much suggesting maybe that true fulfillment does not come from the outside world but from within and if the outside world decides to provide you with some comfort you should learn to accept it without questioning the fabric of every little aspect of it br br unconfortable but makes you reevaluate some existential questions which have become mainstream in the last century like what can man do in a world increasingly drained of substance a consumer driven world in which man can be interchanged without making a difference to the bigger picture but only as long as he is of some use to the system
<START> well i think i've finally seen my last woody allen movie i read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good woody allen experience as i've had many times in the past well that was not the case this movie has nothing to offer even with the wonderful performance by the talented sean penn this movie failed one of the features of his other movies is multiple characters variety witty dialogue this movie basically consisted of only one character very one dimensional it had almost no laughs it probably looked good on paper i think the only thing special was the performance of samantha morton now i'll be looking for her movies in the future so in conclusion this movie was a major disappointment
<START> okay now i am pretty sure that my summary got your attention and my commenting that zazu pitts is satan is not without some basis let me explain the film at first appears to be a dandy b movie about an evil organization called the crooked circle and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes while this is very odd especially the idea of a club of private citizens who solve crimes and could have been interesting this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors why well because zazu pitts never one of my favorite actresses spends most of the movie whining just like olive oyl with a bad toothache while murders are being committed people are being kidnapped or whatever you can always count on zazu whining at full volume almost like someone's obnoxious 3 year old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her at the same time she's not an integral part of the film but received top billing why she is even there is beyond me i assume it's just to whine and yell as a result i found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined now you probably know why i referred to this actress of dubious talent as satan i'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product they too felt pretty much the same way i did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performance br br this film is in the public domain and can be found for free download on the internet i can see why
<START> this gem captures early 80's life brilliantly as a grad '83 boy br br myself i must say that valley girl along with fast times at br br ridgemont high stands out as the class of the teen sex film br br genre the characters are accurate representatives of the era the br br vapid mall chicks pseudo punk rebels preppy jocks are all br br represented here br br i have seen this over ten times now the music in the film was top br br notch unfortunately these tunes could were never as popular in br br their era as those by arena like journey styx or br br before the soundtrack existed i searched out records br br and tapes it was the 80's after all of josie cotton sparks br br and modern english br br this movie deserves respect it isn't just a good 80's teen flick it is br br a great film period
<START> taut topical political thriller taking square aim at the controversial us policy of rendition another appalling orwell ian phrase collateral damage anyone for the illegal interrogation even torture of terrorist suspects by passing due legal process the inhuman interrogation is overseen by the egyptian chief of police himself the target of a fundamentalist suicide bomb plot thus entwining the two main plot lines of the movie both work very well the bombing set piece graphic and chilling in its realism with its denouement revealed in a stylish tarantino type flashback and the torture scenes on an innocent man also unflinchingly portrayed in all their gory detail the film scores telling points about the use of torture as a credible means of intelligence gathering in the war against terrorists and against the faceless bureaucracy here personified by a suitable cold meryl streep as the cia boss who casually gives the order for rendition which can ruin innocent lives never mind kafka's fiction think more the recent killing of the innocent brazilian in london in 2005 with the head of the metropolitan police still in his job and no one tried for the poor man's murder the acting is excellent throughout the two key roles of the innocent man and terrorist bomber are realistically and tellingly played by the unfamiliar actors omar and similarly as the intimidating chief of police and as his idealistic lovelorn daughter ring true with their performances their lack of familiarity at least to me adding to their characters' credibility of the bigger hollywood names present gyllenhaal's stature grows with succeeding films here playing the initially detached but later conscience stricken and anguished government man who does the right thing in the end witherspoon plays her distraught wife part mainly in one key but is believable all the same while david fabrizio and alan arkin convincingly show up self serving senators and their lackeys who'll only go so far to help you until their career prospects are jeopardised there are a few weaknesses plot wise there's little dramatic need to create the suspense surrounding el escape and streep's character is perhaps too obvious a bogey man woman worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of gyllenhaal's on the spot girlfriend around merely for decoration and a brief gratuitous love scene on the whole though an engrossing thought provoking cinematic experience
<START> there are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments this is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera the book or other carmen movies seen before it just stands for itself and i must say that this carmen does it very well it is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art vicente is a master of atmosphere and the art direction the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience let's take it as it is br br and that brings us to the next misunderstanding someone complains about the typical spanish clichÃ©s in the movie well historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene it is not only an accurate portrait of the black spain of knife and that goya portrayed so vividly but it's also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society honestly anyone who doesn't want to see any clichÃ© about spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see carmen but in this case those clichÃ©s are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices br br another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language it is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines if all the rest of the audience did the problem most likely lies somewhere else paz vega has an immaculate diction with her andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible her argentinian partner leonardo gives also a convincing portrait of the basque officer that became a bandolero and her accent is very well learned br br no less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material to say that paz vega is horrible suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons we already had in spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing without mentioning it explicitly and that was not totally fair for the rest of us especially for the ones that hadn't detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't necessarily had to care for i'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role because that's what we got paz vega is carmen and an excellent one in vicente movie
<START> this is definitely one of the weaker of the series of carry on films it lacks the usual fun and sparkle and even the cast seem embarrassed by the poor dialogue by the time this came out the series was in terminal decline and boy does it show if you're coming fresh to this series avoid this one till near the end
<START> i hadn't planned on watching because i didn't like that much i thought was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational arsenal of stars anyway i was talked into watching one night and i regretted it a lot the plot is not only boring but also senseless i honestly don't even know what it was all about i left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn't like it much more pleasure i can tell you that but even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless my advice don't watch go watch team america hilarious btw and forget about ocean's twelve br br in my opinion the most boring and senseless peace of crap to be on the screen in years
<START> remember the wooden undramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst you will when you see this broadly acted unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolate box adaptation most culpable of all is catherine z j who while undeniably easy on the eye substitutes swishing a big dress and looking sultry for actually turning in a performance played po faced like a melodrama or cold comfort farm without the jokes this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who misses entirely the novel's sense of irony or tragedy a shame given the quality of the acting talent on offer joan plowright claire skinner steven macintosh all deserve better than this
<START> set in the near future a dark stranger walks into some southern american city plagued by zombies settling with a group of friendly face inhabitants our stranger learns the harsh realities of city life there are two groups of people the upper classes who dwell safely behind the concrete walls of the city being provided by at the right price the state police then there are our friendly face inhabitants these lower class folks live along side the zombies there only means of survival is to trade goods which they for during the day with the police in exchange for tins of food our stranger discovers why his world is plague by zombies a new pill that suppressed the craving for was the foundation the human race's desire to shed fat caused the down fall of society as we know it these pills increased the desire for protein i e meat even the pet poodle however there was one more grave side affect after death people became reanimated with an even stronger craving for protein namely human flesh br br with what i feel is an imaginative introduction i felt that this film many realise some inventive material what better way could explain the cause of the zombie race than by a contemporary idea of people's desire to make any sacrifice to change their body without the hard work of the gym however the imagination of this film soon stopped after this exposition this film falls into the old trap of 'i can not imagine what the world will be like when society when you watch this film you do not escape to a different world as you do when you watch planet of the apes original alien mad max or texas chain saw original in this film the alternate society is define by people with hair dyed orange and green face paint and charity shop leather jackets there is no harshness about life in this alternate society just healthy faces and over made up zombies films should allow you to escape not remind you that you need to clear out your wardrobe and take your old cloths to the charity shop br br forget about some of the pitiful acting or the over made up zombies this film fails because it is too polished too congenial and too predictable i have watch films like this since the early eighties if you are going the make a film of this nature i suggest you need to watch again such films as dawn of the dead original and remake threads or fulci's zombie to see and experience that feeling of desperation in a devastate society
