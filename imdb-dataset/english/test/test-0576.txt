<START> hail the woman is one of the most moving films i have ever seen in my entire life i watched it twice in a row and sobbed my eyes out br br this silent film masterpiece deserves a much wider viewing audience unfortunately the sole surviving print is so badly scratched that most people won't watch it all the way through and they will miss the gem shining underneath the rough this film could use a digital restoration to help bring out its beauty but i doubt it will get it from anyone since its main theme is spiritual restoration before christ of the family unit and this is not politically correct these days however it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts are hurting from the pain of broken family relationships br br the cast is magnificent especially florence vidor who literally glows as judith the daughter ethereal madge bellamy as nan the poor girl who gets pregnant and is cast aside theodore roberts as the crotchety old domineering father who destroys everyone around him through pride and handsome lloyd hughes as the son david afraid of his father but really of life itself br br this is a nice film to watch at christmas especially you will not regret being patient and viewing it in its entirety despite its deterioration
<START> film noir at its best set in the immediate aftermath of wwii 1946 crossfire depicts the good bad and ugly of that time monty montgomery kills sam because sam's a jew and therefore automatically perceived through monty's narrow lens to have been a slacker who got out of fighting the war monty doesn't like people like that the truth is that sam was a soldier too but the truth is something which disappears when you're feeling right about the ideologies of hate you've been immersed in and the world is full of dirty this and thats badly in need of your brand of cleansing br br monty is a sadist in winning soldier's clothing the losers of wwii had more than their share as well hate filled prejudiced leaders and soldiers as well some of them were hung for war crimes like starting a war of aggression br br this movie got its makers in trouble when that other sadistic of america joe mccarthy got his hearings going in the early 1950s br br see crossfire just to see how good an actor robert ryan was the real robert ryan was no monty he was a great if underestimated under used actor br br see crossfire and get a taste of the dark side of post wwii america see it to get a taste of the good side of late 40s america as well robert and robert young also play leading roles could have played ryan's role in fact he did when he played the psychopath in cape fear
<START> the power started off looking promising but soon became boring and tedious to watch the plot is about an ancient aztec doll that takes possession of those who own it the idea is decent enough and this film would have been fairly entertaining had it been done better however after the first ten minutes or so it soon becomes boring we don't get any good death scenes and have to listen to loads of talking at the end one of the possessed men meets his death by melting away in front of two girls but it's not very interesting and definitely not gory br br i wouldn't recommend the power to any horror or slasher fan as there's little to be gained from it
<START> a formula for murder isn't a well known giallo but that isn't to say it's not a very good one the film is directed by alberto de martino the man behind cult classics such as the antichrist and blazing the film was released late on in the giallo cycle but more than stands up to many of the films released around the period in the early seventies despite a lack of logic in some areas the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists and a host of well defined characters the film is perhaps not as exciting overall as many other films in the genre but this is more than compensated for by the assured way that the central situation is fed to the audience and the tension resulting from that the plot begins by showing a fake priest raping a young girl named joanna before pushing her down a flight of steps we then fast forward several years and the girl is now a woman who is unfortunately in a wheelchair she is being trained for a sports event by craig a man who also has romantic designs on her however his proposal isn't met with glee by personal assistant who also has romantic designs on her br br the film features a plot twist half way through that makes up the backbone of the movie and while it's not exactly logical it's good to watch and hints that you're in for an interesting movie director alberto de martino is clearly not afraid to show a few outrageous gore scenes and the best of which in this film features a priest being battered to death by a spade and i personally wouldn't hesitate to name that sequence as one of my favourite giallo murder scenes the plot can be a little uneven at times but generally the action is very good the director spends what seems like an eternity on the conclusion to the film but it's absolutely packed with tension and the way that it plays out is good in that it takes advantage of all the plot points that have gone before it the musical score taken from fulci's the new york ripper works well in this film also and breaking a giallo tradition de martino's film also features some rather good acting performances from cult veteran david warbeck and christina in her only feature film role overall this film isn't one of the easiest giallo's to come across but its well worth tracking down and comes recommended to fans of this sort of film
<START> even by the standards of most b movies this movie is by far the worst i've ever seen the graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic the ocean water effects are especially laughable including the one scene where they board the mini sub and the water looks like its frozen in place the problems with this film are so numerous that i'll just stop here with the details needless to say i kid you not when i say that even uwe toilet boll himself could do a better job avoid this movie at all cost there are other b grade movies out there that despite being horrible are at least a good way of passing the time by
<START> there are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making br br potyomkin is one of these movies and it should be on anyone's list looking to learn more about the history of cinema br br sergei m eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a russian battleship when the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors the locals embrace the them and support them things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business what follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema anyone who has seen the untouchables and potyomkin knows exactly what i mean br br overall i think this movie raised the bar for film making just as intolerance did a few years earlier if you do not mind silent films do yourself a favor and see potyomkin br br if you don't like silent films watch potyomkin anyway br br
<START> i was shocked at how good this german version of films such as scream was surpassing all the modern american efforts at slasher films br br it as what all those films don't likable characters genuine mystery suspense graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack br br this stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out in years german cinema is going from strength to strength just lately its a shame more people wont go to see such films because they are missing out it is easily available on dvd so even if you hate subtitles i think you should see it it will be one of the best horror films you will see all year
<START> having seen carlo documentary on luchino visconti i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied i faced a need for critical opinion which i generally don't like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally but when i read the reviews already written on this title i also felt a bit confused people sometimes don't know what to criticize therefore to be clear i'll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably the former one about visconti before his director's career and latter one about visconti the director br br the aristocratic background all the hobbies the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents' divorce we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as a real count of milano in riches galore with cooks with access to everything in true aristocracy for instance his father's splendid villa at and other marvelous villas prove that there is also an emphasis on visconti's crucial visit in paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people left wingers who later had impact on his style and message in art that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing a contrast at first sight br br however the part about his director's career which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with just before the director's death in 1976 is poorly executed his movies are not discussed well why because there are very few people who really have something to say franco zeffirelli the director remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right there are also some interviews with franco but later such movies like il la caduta dei rei la morte a venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger although i liked the actor in the role of ludwig i did not like the interviews of his moreover some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster a mention about and romy schneider should also be made there is one footage interview with maria that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit franco zeffirelli though i appreciate him as a director makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious for instance he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service therefore i say simplified and unsatisfactory br br what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself as a result we may get his own opinion about his works for instance i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwig br br i believe it is better to see luchino visconti 1999 by carlo than this doc although it is shorter and condensed as a whole you will get a better idea of the director visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people's emotions and viewpoints into stone 4 10
<START> definitely worth watching br br ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite opera aria you don't need to be an opera lover to watch this film although of course if you hate opera you're really going to have a bad time with this br br not surprisingly the segments range from brilliant to only fair most of the fuss seems to be over godard's contribution whether you think he's brilliant or pretentious his segment won't change your mind br br some of the pieces have a clear narrative others are more a montage of connected images br br none of the pieces is more than 10 minutes or so if you're not happy with what's on the screen wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you're soaking up br br keep your eyes open for performances by buck henry beverly d'angelo elizabeth hurley briget fonda tilda swinton and john hurt the buck henry segment alone is worth the price of admission br br
<START> i'm doing a thesis on blurring the boundaries the female cross dresser and am using tipping the velvet the book as my main text any comments on gender and sexual identity gender and sexual confusion gender as a performance gender as a fiction gender imagery cross dressing as an erotic fantasy and as revolution the effect of the male costume etc etc would be much appreciated but a bit off the point has anyone seen sergio 1987 film vera its about a young lesbian possibly transsexual cross dresser i'm dying to see it because i think it'd be really helpful does anyone know where i might get a copy of it i've tried amazon and a few other sites but no luck
<START> susie q is one of those rare and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling it's bittersweet but wholesome and it's characters are fun and captivating at first i thought the movie would be the clichÃ© cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes but was i wrong it made me tear up at times and it's plot was enticing making me root for the good guys i loved the movie and still remember it today 9 years later i recommend it highly to anyone and the movie is family oriented so you won't have to worry about unsuitable content truly if disney would show more movies that are up to par as susie q it would be the most popular family oriented channel in the world now if only disney would show it just one more time go susie q
<START> ice the limerick br br a virus pulled out of the ice br br just didn't know how to play nice br br if infected you'll kill br br because you are ill br br the cure is to be infected twice br br ice is a great episode one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldn't ask for much better throughout the entire series it starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also a group of scientists in alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other now mulder and scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened as mulder says this is either because they are brilliant or expendable i take this to mean that they had better be brilliant or else the group soon finds out that the cause of mayhem is a small parasite pulled out of the ice core a little worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior since the pilot is infected the rest of the show turns to a suspenseful sort of who done it paranoiac thriller as the others begin to suspect each other of being infected this is not helped at all by an overly paranoid doctor hodge who is un trusting of anyone which we learn early on by the first thing he asks to see everyone's credentials to make sure we are who we say we are events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them br br there are a number of things i like about the episode and of course certain characters that i want to smack in the face from this episode as well as a couple loopholes but most can be attributed to heightened caution and not thinking clearly i like bear from the moment i first meet him its a shame he has to die i also like the scene shown from the other scientist's point of view as mulder and scully argue in the other room it gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a viewer and for me seems to say maybe we shouldn't assume that just because someone is government means they know all sorts of conspiracy secrets as much as hodges frustrates me in this episode i do think that mulder was as much to blame for some of the rash actions taken as any i really like scully in this episode first of all she can tackle like a frickin linebacker second i really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let trust and friendship of mulder keep her from her judgment i love the scene when she goes into the room to sleep and first looks as the picture of the previous group all hugging and the birthday presents from them to whoever used to sleep in that room and then how she suddenly freaks out and pushes the dresser in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with her knees pulled into her chest we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says bosom buddies this is such great writing a way to say without any words that scully is worried that she may not be able to trust even her very best friend br br unfortunately this heightened suspicion leads the group to believe mulder to be infected since he murphy's dead body even though they haven't inspected him at all to find out for sure that was my main problem with the behavior of the characters is they could easily have solved all the suspicion simply by giving blood but i guess i probably would have acted rashly in that situation too but then stupid hodges decides that he has to assume mulder is infected even though mulder willingly surrenders and then is going willingly to be inspected and almost infects mulder in the process luckily he sees that it is really dasilva that is infected and we finally reach a resolution at least as much as you can expect from an x file the government wastes no time in torching the evidence as always happens in these cases and mulder is left with yet another frustrating unsolved case in closing i give ice and easy 10 10 and i leave you with a haiku br br we're not who we are it goes no further than this it ends right here right now
<START> the twins effect is the worst movie i've seen not only is the support weak but the characters as well i'm sorry to say to you edison fans but is by far the weakest vampire i've seen in my life i'm sorry edison your role in this movie was disappointing edison does not fight whatsoever in this movie and i'm sure if they didn't have in the movie the plot wouldn't be much different the main plot in the movie is not explained nearly enough and the entire movie focused too much on helen and growing relationship i mean who the hell was and why did they need his blood yeah he's the prince right so what br br certain scenes in this movie were just plain stupid yeah the action was great but the entire outline of it was stupid in one scene towards the end duke says that is the strongest of his brothers yeah it would seem so now that he's full grown why would you wait until he's grown up to attack another scene was with jackie chan one of my personal favorites in the scene jackie asked helen who were the creatures that persistently followed them how can you be so naive as to not know that they are vampires people are dying around them with bite marks on their necks surely the news would be on it faster than you can say vampire br br the characters were yet another mistake in the movie helen played by charlene choi is the girlfriend of what kind of girl would not be scared of vampires especially if it is your brother's job to kill them i can bet you that you would not find such a brave girl as helen if you searched your whole life helen is annoying bitchy and is a total drama queen in the movie she tries too hard to be different and in the end fails miserably one of the weirdest and most disturbing characters i've seen in any movie why would you bite someone's neck especially if you're not a vampire it's very odd that her reaction to confession doesn't turn him off played by edison chen is another stupid character in the story how degrading for a young actor as himself to play in a movie with such a poorly constructed role he does not stand up for himself throughout the movie and does not fight although i'm a fan of edison i wouldn't want a man who lies on the ground the whole time gypsy and reeve are my favorite characters in the movie their love is pure and sweet gypsy is gorgeous and does not try too hard like helen reeve played by ekin cheng is wise and seems to be the only person that makes sense in the movie a plot failure was the death of reeve the movie had absolutely no substance yet it doomed itself by removing one of the only likable characters another character was duke the story didn't focus much on him and therefore made his desire to obtain rock seem irrelevant br br it's very sad because towards the end of the movie i was forcing myself to watch because i so desperately wanted to see fight the end was so abrupt because the whole time i was expecting so great to happen who's the supposed vampire prince does nothing for the movie and i'm sure if he were taken out the movie wouldn't be much different i highly recommend you to not waste your time on this movie as i have i was greatly disappointed if you're in search of a great movie why not watch lord of the rings or pirates of the caribbean likeable characters with a well written plot
<START> this movie is not that good at all its pretty stupid pretty annoying and very poorly done i really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this film although i didn't hate it as much as them i still found it to be a pretty bad film the only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times and also i feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okay what i mean by a little better is that if it had been totally recast not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher film instead it isn't but instead what it is now a crappy film the acting is atrocious i felt as if i was watching a couple of teens act for like a halloween show or thrill ride or something the kills are pretty cheap as is the film itself and basically everything else is low class overall this film really is bad and you wouldn't be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this film br br 3 8 out of 10 stars
<START> this is the only christopher guest movie that rivals spinal tap and princess bride for sheer entertainment value but somehow never gets near the recognition the plot surrounds the contestants dogs and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dog ok it's about a dog show the owners truly are characters as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs that's really all there is to it but that makes it funny enough br br you'd never be able to convince me that a mock u about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where levy and o'hara visit larry miller's house on tv but that's really all it takes to convert any doubters spinal tap was non stop hilarity joke after joke whereas best in show was had a few more lulls and by that i mean say 3 minute at most where something riotously funny doesn't happen but the big laughs are even bigger br br the casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in uh movies in general parker posey does a fine job in fact her tirade directed at ed begley jr and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film br br what's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot simple as it was around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction i guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over the top the realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than mighty wind or the uneven guffman i actually encounter wierdos like this now and then if you like guest's stuff at all you should definitely own this one
