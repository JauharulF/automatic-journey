<START> i completely disagree with the previous reviewer this movie has amusing moments but hardly a laugh riot unless you really think sipping from a septic tank and heads exploding in a vice are a laugh riot in fact the only reasons i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 are because a two of the actors are decent b the soundtrack is above average with some tuneful pop songs thrown in for contrast and c the monster truck is pretty terrifying br br other than that this is a movie with some intermittent creepy or interesting ideas which are overwhelmed by unrelenting crassness crudity and vileness the former best friend character is one of the most annoying i've ever seen and the small grace that the hitchhiker character had disappears in yet another contrived twist ending that makes little to no sense at all br br a waste of the lead actor who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress portraying the hitchhiking character
<START> i gave this a 2 and it only avoided a 1 because of the occasional unintentional laugh the film is excruciatingly boring and incredibly cheap it's even worse if you know anything at all about the fantastic four
<START> worth the admission price for the rock off alone any d fan will love this movie even though it's a tad short and cameos from john c reilly ben stiller tim robbins meatloaf and dave just about recognisable prove that the d rock hard enough for anyone even dio the sasquatch mushroom scene is going to become an instant classic i don't want to say any more and be accused of putting spoilers in here fans of the original hbo series will see a couple of nods to the d's early on screen appearances in characters such as lee and the open mic host i only wish that they had played a few of the songs from the first album and the omission of 'the government totally from the pod album is also a shame other than that this movie rocks obey the d
<START> this is absolutely nothing like the wwf and the era' of the wwf i have always been a dedicated wwf fan and i never took a glimpse of its competition now i rue the day that i wanted the wwf to take charge at the least the wcw would try something new and radical all the time instead of keeping up as a mask of the actual intentions of the show and this holds true to ecw as well the wwf has always been about hulk hogan andre the giant and other old wrestlers like so and the era' only happened to catch up with the radical ideas of the competition the wwe is the same trash as it was before the attitude era only dumbed down and the wrestlers are terrible the brand split is mind scrambling and the story lines and are non existent the wwe is so bad that it ceases to even be a former shell of itself by pushing characters and wrestlers into the main event suddenly and by retaining barriers of creativity sure the show shakes the brains of sweet innocent and easily brain washed children and meager lousy pariah stupid people of the internet wrestling community that actually consider the company anything good anybody that even shudders and rests on the thought that this show and product is good can go straight to hell
<START> i first saw this film as a teenager i'm now in my 40's and have long considered it to be my favorite movie the story is enormously moving without being sentimental the acting especially by march and loy is dead on and the fact that dana andrews is too old for his role doesn't take away from the believability of his romance with theresa wright whom i believe is the only major character in the film still living this could have turned out to be another post war melodrama but the script and cast are simply too good for that to happen
<START> when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for it nothing to do not in the cinemas nor on dvd neither on blue ray absolutely nothing how it's possible this could really happen the direction is impeccable the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and james franco is hot as hell br br please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life this is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance br br
<START> a few words for the people here in cine club the worst crap ever seen on this honorable cinema a very poor script a very bad actors and a very bad movie don't waste your time looking this movie see the very good or any movie have been good commented by me say no more
<START> this is a awful re make of a very good movie called up in the air starring frankie mantan moreland and marjorie reynolds i was only able to get through about 20 minutes before turning it off almost all the lines are identical i have no idea why they would re do the movie i totally disagree with a previous post that dislikes the songs there the same also in the original the singing is first rate i'm not sure if marjorie reynolds actually did her own singing it's hard to tell since the vocals were usually added later and the songs are very good surprising in a b movie if you get the chance see the original it's available on dvd you'll be pleasantly surprised
<START> yes bam cried a couple times and so did englund and most probably you will too the whole cast is back in action and knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messed up retards i mean this in the best possible way i first thought maybe bam or steve o were the main go to guys nope the main man is now johnny don't get me wrong everybody and i mean everybody is great in this flick right from the get go you're laughing and believe you me don't plan on resting that smile of yours i personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first you know when you go into a theater and you kind of don't want to have high expectations for it well this movie blows all expectations away if you love jackass you can go into this with gigantic expectations no matter what you'll laugh your ass off if you're not laughing the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating jack sh t for breakfast and jack left town all i have to say is prepare yourself to have a sore face after the movie
<START> i think it's about 3 years ago when i saw this movie accidentally i revisited the info site for it here and immediately i felt good again i remembered seeing this movie and loving life again it showed me i could find love and what do you know i have a boyfriend for a year and a half now and love is definitely there
<START> something i think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future no other theatrical movie that i can recall predicted that when the space shuttle went to study halley's comet that a disaster would occur some differences were the churchill the shuttle in the movie actually went to the comet the challenger was only in low earth orbit the churchill was merely burned out inside whereas the challenger exploded hey the vampires had to get back to earth one great similarity and this is always bad luck both had mixed male female crews the legend of halley's comet and disaster continues br br other than this there is not much more to be said about this movie that hasn't been said before as a outer space science fiction horror sex film individually it provided nothing really new but as in all great dishes it is the combination that counts and taken together this was a highly original and satisfying combination br br i just wish mathilda may would drain her victims through another part of the body
<START> big fat liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing great production and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap the two stars work great together and what can i say amanda bynes shines putting and lee majors in the film were brilliant touches watch this film with your kids if you don't laugh throughout it you must not have been paying attention
<START> the italians are undeniable masters in the questionable art of ripping off and imitating movies what they do is take an innovative money making and foreign concept maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action sleaze and political incorrectness but what to do when the non italian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy well then i guess you simply disregard everything in terms of story building or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie this italian turkey was inspired by richard fleischer's successful slavery saga mandingo released one year earlier but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title you shouldn't expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth character drawings unsettling atmosphere or thought provoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships is pure and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already the characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards which is of course to expect when you're dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in south america the elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower who probably also won a couple of moustache of the year awards who exploits and whips the slaves working for him his mistress who if i understood correctly is also his cousin is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to with crucified slaves when the plantation owner's son returns from europe after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last the handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times even in front of the slaves supposedly to demonstrate how their masters do itÂ but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter his romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever hey Â i just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes sound like an interesting film well it's not and i apologize if i raised anyone's it's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through but if the themes appeal to you then definitely check out the aforementioned mandingo much rather than sick exploitation that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film with real actors great music and impressive filming locations has nothing absolutely nothing to offer
<START> i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it but even more shocked by some of the comments i have read here one person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not therefore one person wrote that since he wasn't an american citizen therefore some people comment that the people in the middle east hate us and want us dead therefore so are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an american citizen are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead are we saying that as is written in the geneva convention the declaration of human rights and the constitution of the united states that torture is wrong but some torture is less wrong than others when does it become right to torture that is why this movie is powerful it is ambiguous but not about torture torture is always wrong and if we are willing to do it even in the name of justice and national security or freedom and democracy then we are wrong and we are evil we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing and we are calling them wrong in the same breath my favorite line in the film was if you don't want to compromise join amnesty international right on
<START> the joe cool review hellraiser bloodline br br starring bruce ramsay as phillip john merchant dr paul merchant valentina vargas as angelique and doug bradley as pinhead br br plot this follows a timeline of the lineage of the merchant bloodline which started with phillip who created the box that opens the doorway to hell starting with the 18th century to present time when pinhead first meets merchant and tries to sever the bloodline he's the only one who can stop pinhead you see and finally in the future in space where paul merchant has finally figured out how to send pinhead to hell for good br br openers this is a movie hated so much by the people who made it they declared fictional director alan smithee would be the credited director they only pull smithee out of the woodwork when they really think they've made a terrible movie such as classics as the birds ii end or bloodsucking pharaohs in pittsburgh no i didn't make that up how did i like it you're reading this so i'm sure that's what you want to know br br the good this movie isn't as bad as you've been led to believe oh i'm not going to sugar coat it this movie was filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster but it does have some positives cooler this time around for starters such as the twins and the demon angelique pinhead is still in a main role and still has good lines pain has a face allow me to show it to you and it's somewhat entertaining throughout gorehounds will love the movie because of it's endless supply there is also some continuity with the rest of the series although you'll have to look hard to see it the dog is awesome br br the bad but for a story about hell vs the cursed merchant bloodline that could close the gateway forever it was really complicated and held together with duct tape nothing was really explored to it's full potential and there were some really stupid things included pinhead kidnaps a kid and holds him for ransom random deaths just to feature more blood not always a bad thing but not for the sake of the story pinhead is at his worst here he rants and rants and rants even when he's about to die for the very smart demon that he used to be he's been reduced to nothing more than a bond villain at best if hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why he was moved back into a cameo like role this is it bloodline ruined it for us all br br the ugly gore is always mentioned here this one has skin ripping drilling hook impaling beheadings and more goodies the dog while awesome reeks of bad special effects during the chase scenes br br final verdict this movie had the potential for something great even hellbound levels of greatness but all of that was wasted who knows exactly what went down to produce this crap but we can only blame alan smithee br br compared to the rest this movie is the worst of the hellraiser series for completists only br br rating 1 2 of
