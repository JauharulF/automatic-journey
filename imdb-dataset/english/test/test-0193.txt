<START> every once in awhile i'll remember that i've actually seen this bizarre fiasco that's a cross between whatever happened to baby jane sunset boulevard the lana turner lsd movie the big cube and the manson murders which also took place in 1969 but maybe before this so called movie was made there are some descriptions of the plot already here so i won't go into it but it's worth noting that miriam hopkins plays a parody of herself a chattering ego maniacal fading actress perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the bette davis horrors the old gal hopkins never stopped working so you have to hand it to her she shows a little too much flesh in this movie something davis and crawford would never have done and there's a scene with miriam in the actual tacky hollywood boulevard christmas parade which must have been filmed xmas 1968 br br gale is old old old it's just shocking how wrinkled and awful she looks john garfield jr looks a bit like his father but not as interesting i think one of the three stooges is the tour guide at the beginning if it's not one of the stooges it's somebody br br i was astounded to come across this thing in the form of a commercial videotape given to me by a friend who knows all about junk like this it's amazing
<START> what a waste john travolta and scarlett johansen deserved better than this to start at the beginning jt was horribly miscast in the lead here the role called for someone who could convince as a broken down anti hero someone who could look haunted and defeated billy bob thornton would have fit the bill or even al pacino but jt is just too alive and looks to be having too much fun also surely someone who has been through the mill to the extent character had would have suffered some physical effects the character presented to the audience looked as if he could start as tight end for the oakland raiders scarlett faired little better role wise where was the pain and conflict of what should surely have been troubling development and as for the plot well none of it makes sense the characters leap from one frame of mind to another seemingly without cause and certainly without explanation the pace of the film also leaves something to be desired namely pace this is a very slow film not that i have anything against slow films as long as they are heading somewhere the pace only picks up towards the very end when it shifts from a slow dirge to a frantic race to pack in as many tired clichÃ©s as possible in this it succeeds the only thing missing being something involving a small dog 3 out of 10 for this one purely for gabriel performance he was the only member of the cast who was a well cast and b able to convince in his role all in all a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours
<START> here in australia nights in is being promoted in the same class as the notebook quite frankly what a lot of rot br br this film is a like a recipe on paper we have all the right ingredients richard gere normally perfect in this genre diane lane an old favourite from under tuscan sun and unfaithful ocean side location solitude and yet the movie sucks at the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left the main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place and perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like histories that gere and lane's characters bring to the movie there's hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see romance there's no warmth from gere's character lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out so as the viewer we cannot really connect to the characters br br others here say the book is great well be it the screenplay direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie it's like the scenes and the buildup are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order they've just been thrown together all over the place br br very disappointing save your money for when it hits the video shops and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate

<START> hello it is i derrick cannon and i welcome you to the first ever review show my movie for this week was debatable what route what movie what excellent four star epic would i choose guess what i decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route i've decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman the stars in this movie include christopher allport as sam eileen seeley as anne marsha clark as marla david allen brooks as agent manners sean patrick murphy as captain fun ray cooney as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost br br it's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frost loved the carrot scene but it's even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie the only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder sam seemed more paranoid then he did in the original his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie his wife however was one of the few bright spots she played her role as the main woman to a hilt she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy the scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given if it wasn't for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like chucky freddy and jason laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had spunk he had humor and most importantly he had an vicious streak br br this movie could have been so much more it could have been a continuation of a great franchise instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled br br this movie gets a two out of ten for me and it's lucky that it even gets a one
<START> i watched this as part of a vampire movie marathon with research intent otherwise there is no way i'd have watched it all the way through the first scene wherein a bunch of vampires in very bad wigs seemingly get electrocuted by various slow moving weapons wielded by an even slower moving van helsing wannabe in black and white with a voice over sets the pace for the entire rest of the film the fight scenes look ridiculous the dialouge would be funny if the acting wasn't so bad what passes for plot doesn't make sense and the production values bite from the knock off of spike's coat worn by the hero to the cheesy cheap magician's cape their lead vamp swooshes around br br i've seen some bad movies check out the magic sword with b rathbone or the raven with a very young jack n but this one gets my vote for worst of all times
<START> this is a funny intelligent and in a sense realistic comedy about a 14 year old trying to live her first love while on vacation and also about the complex sometimes amusing sometimes touching relation between a divorced father and her growing daughter and about how far a women not only nicole the teen ager can go to get the man she loves i laughed a lot with this lively scenario that never drags
<START> countless historical cultural mistakes 0 10 br br 1 a jewish guy named omar hahahaha 2 brilliant detective was taking out by the least intelligent guy in the movie 3 jewish suicide bombers that was funny 4 hitler and his top guns went to watch a movie downtown paris with two guards at the door shoot me 5 brad pitt overacted and it was painful to watch him 6 mr qt is re writing history hitler was killed in a really the funny thing about this is that people and i mean stupid people will actually believe this plot br br and finally can any one tell me how this movie made it to the top 250 movies of all time shame shame shame still wondering how can anyone like this movie
<START> distasteful british film from a japanese novel about a very troubled young man who comes under the influence of a hitler like classmate and plots to harm his widowed mother's lover a couple of good scenes sarah miles discovering her son has been peeping at her and confronts him in anger the pasty faced lad trying to ensnare kris kristofferson to his demise by being extra friendly but what's the point beyond provoking shock ugly and uneasy it doesn't showcase anyone involved to any advantage especially kristofferson whose hollow stares and usual gravelly talk is out of place in a psychological mishmash like this one coldly without any sense of its own absurdity director lewis john seems to believe a circumstance like this could actually happen if he's right that's far more shocking than anything in sailor from
<START> horrible movie this movie beat out revenge of the living zombies for the worst movie i have ever suffered through what the were the morons who made this film thinking was it supposed to be scary because man let me tall you it wasn't it was so dumb it wasn't funny we all know that tropical islands are the natural hunting grounds for killer snowmen and those stupid baby snowballs stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid fake snow and lousy actors oh and frost looks nothing like he does on the box do not waste your time rent it and destroy it
<START> this short was director del lord's last and only shemp short the problem it was quite weak and the cafe scene was pretty much a carbon copy of a curly short busy buddies 1944 the interrogation scene was pretty funny and the beginning part of the cafe part but there are a lot of plotholes in this short for example why are the stooges hiding in the garbage can when the police come in the remake of cash and hash 1955 director jules white fixes this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a gunfight between the police and the armored car robbers the scene in which moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with curly in dutiful but dumb 1941 the spooky house part wasn't all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house to top it off the ending had no sting to it rating c
<START> the united states of leland was an amazing movie i kept passing it on the guide on my tv not knowing what it was and never having the chance to sit there and get into it then one morning when i woke up early i saw that it was just about to start so i decided to watch it i had the time and interest to watch it when i saw that ryan gosling was in the movie and then that he was the main character i was immediately sucked in and could not move from my couch the struggle that leland goes through is such an inspiring story everyone has to deal with the same type of thoughts throughout sometime in their life whether it be a small minor detail or something as big as what he's going through i have to sit and watch the movie again just to catch all the stuff that i may have missed the first time around as a general comment i would recommend this movie to anyone who is a gosling fan or anyone who just likes a good movie with a real good story the fact that there are so many other big stars who all also had great performances is just an added bonus so do what you can to take the time to check out this movie i can almost be sure it won't be a waste of time
<START> first of all let us discuss about the story it is a copy of the movie hitch with an added indian flavor to it one guy who is a love guru and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story salman khan is the love guru and govinda is the lame guy br br now coming to artists' performance salman khan overacts throughout the movie he tries to be funny but fails big time you can see salman shouting throughout the movie no real acting is seen in his performance govinda pairs opposite katrina kaif oh my god she is one heck of a girl a real beauty is in real life a 50 year old dude and katrina is a girl in her early twenties in the movie govinda looks like grandpa of katrina kaif what a pity coming to execution of the movie this movie feels like a b movie and a poor imitation of the movie hitch where hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth this movie is shallow and purposeless nowhere there is justification or clarity br br just forget this movie for it is nothing but boring typical bollywood fare actually i give 3 10 because this is the lowest i go
<START> okay i think we're all agreed that michael jackson was the low point br br and the special effects too but please keep in mind that this was not a big budget film okay not every film gets as much of a budget as harry potter or star wars br br however i thought it was pretty funny altogether b nothing that would in my opinion waste your time br br parodies are always fun to watch and just because it wasn't big budget doesn't mean it's bad br br i think this was a good movie if weak at some points br br hope this comment helps angela
<START> may contain spoilers for about the last four years i've been a keen fan of ali g sacha baron cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and in my view his best creation is borat who's as funny as hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people br br anyway to the movie i didn't bother paying money to see this in the cinema i suppose because i didn't expect a lot but when i hired the dvd recently i found the whole thing pretty sad the best part of taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe really br br this movie goes to show i think that some things can run for too long and definitely don't translate to the big screen the movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that i've come to expect from british films where have all the good british movie making ideals gone to that said there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in bed and audience with hm the q with the shaven haven respect remark br br so in summary i am an ali g and borat fan and i have enjoyed many of his interviews notably the one with anita of the body shop but this movie fell really flat with me if there's to be another movie i hope it's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe br br br br australia
