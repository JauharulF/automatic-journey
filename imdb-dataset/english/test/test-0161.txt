<START> all the actors in this film seem bored they are not really interested in their roles and the dialogue is all delivered in monotone it's a problem because i think the basic idea for the film is really very sound i suppose it's just bad direction which leaves the actors drifting
<START> i'd liked the takashi miike films i'd seen so far but i found this pretty disappointing i'd bought it but i won't be keeping it br br i saw it on the dvd which has just two episodes in the first a killer abducts women cuts the top of their skull off to expose the brain plants them in the ground up to their chin and plants a flower in the brain you can tell that from the dvd box in the movie the top of the head is digitally blurred out by tv static had you not seen the dvd box the viewer wouldn't know what people were looking at until later a young cop produced a small model of the body oddly there is also a flash frame later on of the woman's head and it is not censored apart from this i'm not really sure what was going on some women get phone calls and a sketchy animated character around when that happens an animated character also appears on tv screens sometimes it's unclear if anybody sees it br br in the second episode pregnant women are being found cut open and their babies are missing again a cop produces a model of what the corpses are like which is helpful since again the actual body is censored there is also a natural birth in the movie but oddly even that baby and the umbilical cord are censored according the the dvd box uncensored versions were not kept when this was originally made perhaps even if they had if they knew they were going to be censored maybe they didn't bother actually showing anything not sure br br if i hear the later episodes are better maybe i'll look for them as it is i won't bother
<START> i really liked this film it features john wayne in his first starring performance even then you can tell wayne has a real presence although he wouldn't really mature into the icon he is known for until stagecoach 9 years later in 1939 it's about settlers from all over the country heading to the new west to colonize it wayne's character breck coleman joins up but for his own personal reasons most of the main actors were stage actors and had never done a film before which makes the movie even more amazing they managed to create believable distinctive characters and there is quite an oddball mix here cimarron would come out a year later and had a very similar story though i didn't like it as much as this movie for me the big trail is a strong 8 10
<START> a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo even the squibs look awful at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america three wonky old cars do not a country make the mustang even has a wobbly right front wheel the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing it couldn't come soon enough even the jewellery from the robbery looks like the cheapest junk costume jewellery available the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time worth watching if you want to know how not to make a clichÃ© ridden low budget movie
<START> the box is a film with great potential but the makers totally misused that potential the film seemed to take for ever because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and job dialogs between the action those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill the philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of thomas but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds were even harry potter would flunked his class with br br probably the best part was that moment when norma lewis cameron diaz has been shot to death by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will i wonder how would react if he could
<START> leos carax has made 3 great movies boys meet girls sang les amants du pont in fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth the beauty of juvenile wilderness carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about about all he have seen but using it and melting it into his times x is a very different movie because carax made les amants du pont a of 20 millions dollars a film that has destroyed everything on its way after such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view so leos carax has to changed and he did the movie isn't as beautiful as its first it's more reasonable no more studio no more dreamed paris carax has entered at last reality it's not clean anymore it's not poetic characters carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it
<START> miranda cosgrove is known for her debut in school of rock with jack black and her role as megan in the show drake and josh and she has become a fan favorite amongst the nickelodeon public so it isn't a surprise that dan schneider would create a show just for her unfortunately it ends up being as bad as if not worse than the amanda show br br is about three friends carly sam and freddie who have become idols in the junior high community through a webcam show called carly and sam are the hosts and freddie shoots and puts it up on the internet carly also has an older brother named spencer acted by the hilarious jerry trainor who is known for his work in drake and josh as crazy steve br br well let me tell you this don't believe the 8 3 out of 10 this show received because it is pathetic in nearly every aspect dan schneider probably went through about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests because all i see is him saying ipod aha teenagers love anything beginning with 'i' and a majority of gigs that were used in drake and josh if not then they are just really dry and forced jokes that don't even count on a chuckle such as you want me to turn up the ac to 60 degrees no we want you to turn it up to 60 pickles not only that but if you look closely nearly all the sets in the shows were used in drake and josh and ned's declassified that were simply spit and polished with random stuff to try and make it look different br br the scenes where the show is showing a broadcast of the network is just as terrible as the entire series itself the dialogue in them is atrociously bad which may be accepted by some since it is just two friends playing around in front of a camera but what's the deal with the really odd humorless antics they do like random dancing and it just gets worse from there br br in terms of acting miranda and aren't at their best by far nathan who played freddie isn't believable at times but he does an okay job the person who really steals the show is the humorous prowess of jerry trainor who fits in his protective older brother role very well and his wide eyed loud mouthed acting can make for some pretty funny segments too bad they aren't frequent because that might have given the show an extra star in my opinion br br dan schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving miranda cosgrove her own cable born playground to hop around and spew unfunny jokes and pathetic cue card lines in every direction because everyone else has exceptional talent buried underneath the poorly done script and weightless acting dan schneider did a great job with drake and josh so it's a real disappointment that is such a failure jerry acting saved this show from a 1 out of 10 rating but he alone can't save from being as horrible as it is
<START> the outer limits is a brilliant show that for the most part leaves me with very strong emotions there are undoubtedly some stinker episodes but it's essentially an old pulp comic turned into a tv show so that can be expected for the most part it's excellently done well produced and directed and often featuring some big name talent who seem to enjoy working in a solid translation of short fiction to hour long television format br br the outer limits tends to focus on rather large ethical philosophical moral questions and rarely ends without the voice over serious thought br br from time to time the themes are hammered in a little bit too heavily for all but the most thick headed viewers additionally while a certain level of distrust of the government is conducive to an effective democracy you can unluckily catch several episodes back to back that border on the absurd with regards to distrust of the army cia etc one further note is that any large group with power the roman catholic church the people's republic of china and so on are cast in a bad light in frequency ranging from once to often br br while the show can beat a dead horse if it's watched enough the overall quality is astounding and i'm grateful that sci fi has decided to continue airing it until they produce a season by season dvd set and i can afford it
<START> the other day i showed my boyfriend a great movie stand by me a movie i have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it but for some odd reason he didn't like it he lends me a movie called and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it instead i hated this movie i don't think i've hated a movie so much in a while how this movie has even a 6 6 rating is beyond me i couldn't keep up with the five million stories here billy baldwin becoming a fire man the random sibling rivalry the random love story s the who's being an arson story the investigator the fire who has a personality of it's own i just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting i would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why br br the movie tells the story of a group of chicago firefighters two brothers stephen bull mccaffrey the elder brother is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights brian the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter he is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter donald shadow is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession he is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections martin is an on the city council he has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters however is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes br br i just couldn't get into this movie i don't know how anyone else could it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong i loved how they had every action clichÃ© in the book to match this action flick i just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles donald sutherland great actor but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time i know ron was going for great quality but i think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film i even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably kevin spacey the fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there i didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people i'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on br br 2 10
<START> the coen's strike again i had no going in and i was amazed at the bizarre telling of a good bad guy story although clooney is easily in this his cornball style is welcome turturro and nelson are dead and i loved i am a man of constant sorrow as performed by the soggy bottom boys catchy tune br br 8 of 10
<START> wolfgang petersen das boot air force one gives us an exciting film where the accolades go to the supporting actor john malkovich his criminal attempting to assassinate the president was first rate and credible br br that is not to diminish the efforts of clint eastwood and rene russo or even fred dalton thompson who plays a real jerk of a white house chief of staff eastwood was great and i love any film that russo is in br br the movie feature original music by five time oscar winner bugsy the untouchables the mission days of heaven ennio morricone that alone makes it worth your time
<START> i give this movie 2 stars purely because of its slightly liberal plot line without going into too much detail br br the acting in this movie is terrible really terrible wooden shallow br br the graffiti on show is weak so bloody weak that i can only wonder why they bothered to use graffiti artists at all it was obvious in the spraying scenes that they'd gotten other people in to do the 'work' they might as well have let the actors do the painting and saved themselves a few cents br br i would avoid this film at all costs br br the kid loco soundtrack used to be something i listened to on my ipod its going to be a while before i can go back there for fear of this movie coming back into my mind br br avoid at all costs unless you are thinking to yourself wow its been a while since i've seen a really sh t movie
<START> this attempt at a thriller would have no substance at all some may state that this movie has it all autism arson robbery lost love a bag of money cut throats murder blood a snub nosed revolver clenched teeth groaning boobs various definitions can be used large flashlights tribal people a brother duo attempting to out portray dumb and dumber white wolves fight scenes that resemble happy slapping snow mobile s a large tracked vehicle and a motel under renovation all this with an melody toward the end br br perhaps my rating is a bit harsh but one viewing will certainly be enough for the sane with nothing else to do br br
<START> ok we got jp from grandma's boy and chuck from well chuck i thought this movie would be quite good based on the reviews and it did start out pretty high on my movie scale but about halfway through it was just dragging out for so long i kept losing interest i actually got so bored probably because you can see right away what's going to happen in the end the story is actually quite thread bare i skipped over 15 minutes and didn't miss a thing this film should have been a short work maybe around 45 minutes to an hour max it starts out good and finishes good too bad the filling is bland boring dull and lacks everything but time some people say they like it for the music i don't care for jazz and i don't go see movies for their score i go for the story and when that's drawn out well ratings drop in my book br br bottom line good open great close boring filler story was cool but if you don't know what's going to happen a quarter of the way through you haven't seen too many thrillers
<START> i was on a british airways flight from london to new york when i saw this movie i wish i could have fallen asleep the story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did br br gary played by andy garcia was such an unlikable character that i found it hard to be supportive of him andy's acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie br br andie macdowell did a fine job with her portrayal of linda gary's romantic interest i can not say anything bad about andie i always enjoy her acting the problem here is that the romance between andy and andie is so far fetched and unbelievable the two do not make a good pair on the big screen br br the end of the movie was almost as much of a let down as the movie itself a nod from the pope and all is forgiven come on the event that allows this movie to have a some what happy ending and that the writers would expect us to accept it is pathetic gary does not change and only by the death of a dear friend does his situation get better br br there are tons of great movies that should be seen before this one don't waste your time br br
