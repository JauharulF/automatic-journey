<START> some time ago i saw this when hbo was showing it and from what i saw of it it seemed like a good movie so i'm in blockbuster today and i see it there with the dvd's and i decide what the hell so i rent it after i finished watching it i was in shock of how good it was br br this movie just touched my heart everything in it was so amazing the stories the actors the dark humor the music oh don't get me started on the music in this film pt is one of the greats definitely the best thing to come out since quentin tarantino a god br br after i finished the first viewing i watched it again with anderson's commentary i was suprised on how such a cool guy he is br br anybody who is interested in movies at all should watch this movie if they haven't already anderson is obviously a film lover in the movie he rips off so many other directors such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water obviously ripped off from i am cuba but i have no beef what so ever with that the film is very respectable with it's br br i recomend this film to anybody who can deal with some of the content of the film porn br br 10 10
<START> the idea behind this movie was great the story of a little girl facing abuse both emotional and physical and trying to deal with it and survive what makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog the actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again also there is very tedious almost funny overuse of metaphors in the voice overs the high point is the acting of the little girl nice try but this one's a stinker
<START> this film is much the same as cannibal holocaust if it weren't for the needless animal killing in the name of 'shock' ooh look at us we're hardcore we've added real death to our films these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf i'm a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies but as it stands it's another example of shock horror clutching at the last straws of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype to sum up a crusty gore flick with limited appeal a fan of 70's gore should give this a try but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should pick something a little better written for their popcorn fest
<START> william petersen that c s i guy has a small uncredited role but it's the best part of the movie his character comes across smart ass and tough and it's a fun surprise to see him in this he has a range that allows him to play just about anything after his 5 minutes it goes from looking cool to just nothing much it leaves you hoping that his character will reappear in the movie but after 20 minutes you give up hope the movie itself is pretty poor worth a watch on or a pick up at the library but not much more too much of it reminds you of l a confidential except that where that movie starts to get complicated upon itself this one is so loose it steers everywhere but where it should 2 out of 5 stars
<START> it is a nice comedy it has the great features of the childhood lying or trying to get away from own generated troubles the casting is great great acting and the special effects well some stunts are really impressive watch it
<START> the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show but as a movie it doesn't work in the same way br br don't get me wrong this is a very funny movie full of biting witty dialogue that caricatures the modern british wonderfully well whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious if unrealistic story br br one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant or it's embarrassing to watch when i say embarrassing i don't mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras but rather you'll wish they hadn't included it in the final cut one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended to the tune of this is how we do it whenever i watch the film i stop the dvd when it says the end and leave it at that br br overall ali g is a good film worth watching a couple of times the script is enjoyable to an extent and there are no issues as far as acting goes however refinement is the key word here br br ali g is a better television programme borat is a better film
<START> of so many excellent and so on in one particularly compact zing out of them all tickled me so thoroughly that it ends up being the terrific moment of the movie for me br br or at least the one that tends to drive hassling people to see the film brandishing the disc in hand for emphasis br br the existing vague abstract acknowledgement of the fairly simple and concrete guilt involved in the guilty pleasure of this may truly gel and prod me into paying the intellectual bill eventually br br till then br br the demise of the organist was so right on
<START> the beguiled is a strange work among clint eastwood's oeuvre by 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies not only westerns the genre in which he first made his name but also war films such as where eagles dare and cop thrillers such as coogan's bluff yet although the beguiled takes place during wartime the american civil war and was made by don siegel who had earlier directed eastwood in coogan's bluff and was later the same year to direct him in dirty harry it is not an action film in the traditional sense in most of his previous films eastwood had played an active role but here his role is largely passive his character sergeant john is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive even while serving with his unit played no active part in the conflict he is a whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms and was serving with the union forces as a medical orderly br br the film is set in louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured being discovered by a young girl named amy and brought back to her boarding school the school is a small one with only two teachers and a handful of girls although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities the headmistress martha farnsworth decides to shelter him and tend him fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the notoriously harsh prison camps br br although scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls and he wins the affections of number of them including miss farnsworth her assistant edwina and carol one of the older girls even twelve year old amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him in the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred and miss farnsworth rejected in favour of the sluttish carol plots a terrible revenge interestingly the one female to resist blandishments is hallie miss farnsworth's black slave even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her br br the beguiled has been described as an anti war film but this seems to me to be a misconception the film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the civil war or of war in general the only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non combatants and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge not by zeal for the confederate cause it would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war br br at the beginning the school set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion seems like an island of peace amid the war the building is in the classical style associated with order harmony and restraint but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder passion and violence qualities associated with the gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of classicism the film can be seen as falling within what has been called the southern gothic tradition in american film and literature br br the film was not a great hit at the box office possibly because eastwood was cast so much against type it is not perhaps his best film but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes in play misty for me his first film as director made the following year he was again to play a passive character in danger from a vindictive female there are some very good performances from the female members of the cast particularly geraldine page as martha farnsworth outwardly a respectable middle aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions there are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother there are also good contributions from elizabeth hartman as the shy repressed edwina who falls in love with and rejects the idea of revenge and from young pamelyn ferdin as amy amy is an animal lover a key moment in the film comes when kills her pet turtle so it is interesting that in later life ferdin became an animal rights activist the one character i was less keen on was jo ann harris's carol who seemed too modern like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s the film is notable for the emotionally intense hothouse atmosphere which siegel brings to it this will not be a film which is to everyone's taste some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic and some have found it misogynistic judith called it a film for woman haters and sadists others however may find it a compelling psychological drama 7 10
<START> after all the hype i had heard about the jane austin novel and different film versions of the book i found myself very disappointed with the movie i had expected a classic drama but that was not the case first of all let me preface my review with the fact that i love old movies particularly mysteries and dramas but not female oriented movies this probably makes a huge difference so take my review with a large grain of salt i thought the acting was a bit over the top but that is very common in movies of this era june allyson was good as jo but i found every sister to be stereotypical and form driven there were no surprises or overly dramatic moments i hate writing negative reviews but the movie left me very cold it has always been my intention to read the book but after this that seem unlikely the only warming story line was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister that was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience again there are others who love this movie i'm just not one of them
<START> one of our all time family favorites when we need a laugh we just put this one in and laugh all way thru like it is the first time we've seen it this film has good clean family humor pauly shore is brilliant with no plans for the thanksgiving holiday crawl shore is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative coed crawl being a big city boy must adjust to the farm life if he is to fall in love with but crawl isn't the only one who is learning new things crawl teaches and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accepting others this is fun for viewers of all ages
<START> i rented this because i couldn't pass up the chance to see pre hollywood fame clive owen and catherine zeta jones together but it definitely wasn't worth it the only reason i give it two stars instead of one is for the novelty of seeing them before they made it big across the pond br br zeta jones who is usually fun to watch even if she isn't the greatest thesp in the world is awful owen seems really uncomfortable to be in such a turkey plus he wears a ridiculous ill fitting chin length wig at least i hope that's a wig and not his real hair and the scene where he dances a country jig with zeta jones just makes you embarrassed for him joan plowright walks around in a daze the whole movie she's probably wondering how she got herself into such a mess br br the actress who plays clive owen's wife isn't terrible but just about everyone else is oh and the writing stinks too
<START> although the acting was excellent i spent the whole movie waiting for the nasty boy who caused so much grief to so many of the characters get his final nemesis and instead everyone else suffered except him and he gets the job of the husband whose wife's death he causes by running away from his friends wins the girl he gave an overdose to and tried to rape even his friend gives money to his father but the butterfly effect completely fails to return to its cause br br this is a very dark film as each character that gets affected suffers never ending depression none of the normal avenues for relief seem to be effective and the only thing the authorities seem to do is give out quantities of stress pills br br if this is normal behaviour in finland now i'm never going to go back just in case i am affected by such an amoral butterfly and end up as destroyed as the characters in this film were
<START> perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny maybe it was meant to get teenage boys excited at all the nudity in it but what i got out of it was actually something that many people believe in and that is nice guys finish last br br there is a line in angel heart from lisa bonet's character that says it takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster true most likely women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and politeness and whatever but at least at an early age they end up going for the good looking slimy disrespectful untamed guy the one they know they can't conform to their beliefs and that is part of the attraction after all what is exciting about a guy that is already the way you want him to be i believe this may have happened to boaz davidson and what he has to say in this film that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else that teens can relate to is that you will get your heart broken it happens to everyone and it will happen to you and that is a strong final statement in the film but having said all that the movie is fun it is funny and it shows the antics of highschoolers quite well br br this is a rare film that is enough to please the teenage crowd it caters to but also intelligent and poignant enough to show what it s like to get your heart broken no highschool film has ever done this better like i said i think the writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand maybe we all have br br this is an old film but if you ever come across it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night pick it up you may be surprised it is a hell of a lot better than never been kissed
<START> truly awful nonsensical garbage this movie does everything wrong except make the running time under an hour the gore fx defy gravity logic there are no scares the acting is abysmal with everyone appearing to be reading their lines there's a surprise ending that's just silly where we find out that things we saw happen didn't even happen boy do i hate cop out endings they pad this thing out with long drawn out shots of people doing nothing interesting like putting on make up or talking for what seems like forever they have to pad out a movie that's under an hour long ridiculous the story itself is pretty freakin' thin i mean it's just a variation of the movie april fool's day if i remember that movie correctly and that film wasn't all that great either the only good thing i can say is it seems to have been shot well too bad nothing happens that's very exciting
<START> as a longtime admirer of the 2001 film moulin rouge and a more recent admirer of jean renoir's film making i knew that i'd inevitably watch his french cancan sooner or later the movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the moulin rouge nightclub the impresario jean gabin tries to turn montmartre laundress franÃ§oise into a cancan star without arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress the belly dancing lola maria felix this is just one of several love triangles in french cancan true to stereotype these french showbiz folk are always falling in love br br renoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie gabin perfectly the aging french playboy hero is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously used br br french cancan is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage etc only one character ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation the actor who plays him philippe clay is fun to watch a really tall skinny young man who sings dances and does contortions br br the movie ends with a long cancan sequence as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together the dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in moulin rouge in fact if i have one complaint about french cancan it's that the whole thing is a little too technicolor even when experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song the lighting is bright and flat no shadows intruding yes the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy it's just that i can't help thinking that things weren't ever this colorful and innocent in real life
