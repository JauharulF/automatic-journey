<START> this is the first james cagney film i have ever really watched i was never interested in his movies before because i figured i wouldn't like anything in that style of cinema and because i've heard most cagney films are the same i have to say i really liked it by today's standards for movies it was not special but i found it surprisingly entertaining cagney did not have the look of a tough guy but he played the part very well
<START> mary pickford plays annie rooney the daughter of a cop that lives in the tough part of town she is a rough and tumble young lady of indeterminate age somewhere between 12 and 16 who loves to scrap but down deep has a heart of gold br br this is a very typical style of film for mary pickford like so many of her films she plays a young girl even though she was nearly 40 when she made little annie rooney and like so many other stories she was both plucky and courageous as a result i had a strong feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu now if you haven't seen her other films this isn't an issue however she is essentially playing a character much like the one in sparrows or daddy long legs though these two other films are a lot better now this isn't to say this is a bad film just that it's certainly not among her best work mostly due to a rather schmaltzy story that is very heavy on sentiment but not especially convincing entertaining but not essential viewing unless you are a huge fan of the silents
<START> the other lowest rating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add i must stress that i've only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children who insist on watching the sunday omnibus my god it's depressing like all soaps it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be the reviewer who mocked the 'true to life' bilge spouted by its defenders was spot on if anyone lived in a social environment like this they'd slash their wrists within days and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it's rather more than you'll ever see here take my advice avoid this nadir of the british tv industry it is evil
<START> i enjoyed the first toxic avenger but the sequel just didn't work there are some funny gags in the opening involving members of the home for the blind but past that point i was simply bored the sequel is also filled with much quirky low brow humor only this time it's not funny much of the gags revolve around crusty japanese stereotypes almost every japanese character seems to be chopping fish does everyone in japan chop fish the troma films are known for being more than a little irreverent but if you're gonna use humor involving racial stereotypes at least make it funny i can't laugh if i'm handed the same crap i've seen a million times before one thing i have to give credit for is the gratuitous nudity there's even more gratuitous nudity than in the first but altogether i was very disappointed and the film ends with a tedious chase scene which had me huffing and puffing dying for the movie to fade to black at least there's one hilarious line from the film which had me bawling with laughter after the villain says a line from shakespeare to one of the local citizens the citizen an elderly woman responds by saying f k you that's from david mamet br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> since i'd bought the dvd i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet br br the plot has kirk douglas as a successful first novelist who hired laraine day as a secretary falls in love and marries her complications ensue br br douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor given to heavily dramatic roles sometimes hero sometimes rat he's not bad in this thoroughly comic part the problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else br br the plot rambles on a dozen quirky characters come and go most prominently keenan wynn as douglas's friend who does nothing but make wry comments thelma ritter was better at this sort of thing br br well if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of some gags are silly others don't clear that bar here's what i thought of as an amusing line douglas has just hired day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house wynn asks if she liked douglas's previous book last year's love yes of course she did well most of 'last year's love' was done in the beach house ha ha br br nice cast including support but a failed comedy there have been better sitcoms on television
<START> the unthinkable has happened having first witnessed it a few years ago i have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called island a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones i'm not making this up it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on like new schools or cancer treating drugs however for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump guest house paradiso to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch br br based loosely around the puerile but amusing tv show bottom this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable richard is a hotel manager as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action his buddy eddie director adrian is an alcoholic waste of human life and together they try to run britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff top next to a nuclear power station between them they indulge in cartoony violence with sound effects at regular intervals steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all the plot such as it is involves the arrival of fabled italian screen goddess gina vincent cassel who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house paradiso much to the astonishment of richie and eddie and that's it br br i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy we've had films like trainspotting 28 days later four weddings and a funeral and the brilliant shaun of the dead also starring simon pegg but this this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle guest house paradiso is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it i kept watching waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came just an endless stream of trapped knob gags unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk come the first ad break it was on tv you see and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you my readers kept me going i'm watching this so they don't have to became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force fed dog food br br trust me i used to love the bottom tv show the combination of suitably grubby acting from and with ott juvenile humour worked for half an hour every week certainly not for an hour and a half as and indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience honestly this makes mayall's drop dead fred seem like the godfather and should you happen to meet either of these two people who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region they'd probably enjoy it pegg and bill nighy both as guests at the hotel are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived and should not be so lucky the movie equivalent of and should be avoided as such
<START> i cant believe it i thought this is a good sequel when jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors stupid plot and stupid scenes this should be in films of sh t in earth' thank god the same director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny not the pee and not the dancing i laughed at this because of how stupid the person made this like homer simpson making a movie about a doughnut i wish someone makes a remake of son of the mask with a plot like this the mask guy jim carry and his wife have a son which is a normal baby when the baby finds another mask he became the mask too and the mask guy tries to get his mask back this is very crap so i'll give it a 1 out of 10 fu king sh t
<START> boring utterly predictable soap opera mary tyler moore is married to ted danson who's having an affair with christine moore is friends with and doesn't know about the cheating danson dies in an accident and is pregnant with his baby yawn br br i'm ashamed to admit i paid money to see this in a theatre in 1986 i liked all three stars but even their considerable talents couldn't pull this off i constantly knew what was going to happen like another poster said this plays like a pg rated lifetime movie br br it does have swearing nonstop at one point and even moore lets loose once also there's a pointless shots of topless women playing football other than that it's tv friendly the only good thing about this was timothy gibbs playing moore and teenage son very handsome and quite a good actor that aside there's nothing to recommend this you've seen it before and done better it's obviously been forgotten skip it
<START> my father took me to see this film when it was released in 1976 i was but a child and it scared the crap out of me so much so that i had to leave the theatre during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene as it was too intense for me i went home to the safety of my family i saw the film all the way through as i got older and thoroughly enjoyed it shame about the men in monster suits though if you overlook the cheapness of the production and delve deeper you'll find an excellent performance by cushing a stunning opening score some nice photography and the ever reliable mr douglas mcclure my childhood hero british police guarding the whitehouse at the end titty bang bang cave woman monsters with actors in monster suits gliding on wires this has it all superb
<START> i'd been purchasing this one ever since its dvd release Â for one thing because i'd been somewhat underwhelmed by this director's two other horror titles squirm 1976 and blue sunshine 1977 but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly trimmed for gore on the media blasters shriek show 2 disc set i now chanced upon it as a rental and am glad i did Â because not only is it superior to the earlier efforts at least on this preliminary assessment but i also found the film to be one of the better imitations of the texas chain saw massacre 1974 this factor however only helped remind me that i've yet to check out another such example Â wes craven's classic the hills have eyes 1977 whose 2 disc r1 edition from anchor bay i purchased some time ago but after all halloween time is fast approaching br br anyway the film manages an effortlessly unsettling backwoods atmosphere it was shot in the forest and mountain regions of oregon Â with plenty of effective throughout but thankfully not too much violence even if the last of the villains is dispatched in quite an outrageous fashion the principal young cast here one of them played by jack lemmon's son chris isn't quite as obnoxious as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offering Â despite freely indulging in the shenanigans one associates with teen oriented flicks and which by and large persist to this day george kennedy appears as a sympathetic ranger though he doesn't have a lot to do his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life also notable among the locals is familiar character actor mike in a nice role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative Â his warning to the teenagers naturally goes unheeded but he's later able to lead kennedy to them br br the hermetic family the teens come across in the woods then is eventually revealed to be hiding a skeleton in their closet while one of the girls displays genuine curiosity at the presence the rest are openly hostile to them Â and in the case of the burly and uncouth twins appropriately creepy one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his rampages at a certain point in the narrative the ranger even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior
<START> absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story told with unflinching eye and with gripping style if you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people this could change your mind something for you feds too a good model for government coverups if you like your news all tidy and easy to consume this is not for you
<START> i felt this film did have many good qualities the cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story the original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and i felt most played quite convincingly of course they are playing themselves but definitely unique the cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the chinese and oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use i found the jia story interesting on a down note the story is in beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early 90s even though this was made in 2001 so it's really cheesy sometimes the beatles crap etc whatever not a top ten or twenty but if it's on the television check it out
<START> george saunders is a who steals a rare copy of hamlet killing a guard in the process months later an associate of his is selling forgeries of the book for great sums of money one of the forgeries is sold to a man working for the nazi's not happy at being taken the nazi front man insists on getting his money back at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled clients shows up the middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up a meeting at the new york public library between various parties however as people begin to die the library is locked down and more murders and perhaps some rare book larceny seem to be close to happening complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast saunders is joined by richard and a cast of solid supporting players if there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty much out for themselves the layers of theft forgery murder and war time intrigue this was 1942 are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time still its an enjoyable little film with a darkness and sense of inescapable doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film noirs until shows up we're down among some charming thieves whom we like perhaps even more than the hero but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending and they know it even if they fight it a good little film that's worth searching out
<START> lon chaney jr returns to lumber along as the mummy kharis seeking his mate whose soul now resides in the beautiful host of descendant ramsay ames andoheb high priest of arkan george zucco leaves yousef bey john carradine in charge of kharis to continue their evil doing ways tom robert lowery must find a way to save his beloved from certain future mummy terror br br routine predictable entry in the kharis series proves that nearly every film follows a specific format formula the city is threatened by a skulking one armed corpse masked in wrapping who seems to have been gifted with superhuman power to choke the life out of able bodied men who are restrained with relative ease by a mere from kharis frank reicher who saw kharis in action and knows a great deal about egyptian history in the previous film the mummy's tomb proves that anyone who happened to survive a previous encounter with the mummy is sure to die if he returns in the next flick well produced but lacks originality that would set it apart from the other films in the series sadly carradine sleepwalks through his role as the evil yousef bey embarrassing script mistake has kharis who is known for donning a crippled lame right arm carrying an unconscious with both arms for long distances with no ill effects one aspect the shocking climax where tom's attempt at heroism doesn't go according to plan as kharis holds his damsel in distress hostage lifts the film from the doldrums slightly
<START> this is the worst film i've seen in a time it reminded me of a du soleil show i saw in vegas six years ago without the by that i mean a few striking artsy images appear randomly without any sustaining framework the fake sepia tinted film is really tacky this device is almost never justified and certainly is not in with apologies to abe lincoln you can fool some of the people some of the time
