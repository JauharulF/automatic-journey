<START> i think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after seinfeld after and after friends those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time br br came at the end of this special time in tv br br but don't let that dissuade you br br king of queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned br br seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic i never laughed so hard than i did at seinfeld but comes real close br br when it comes to laughing i have to rate second only to seinfeld has to be second though as the character creation and interaction is more endearing br br either way is top ten of the last 20 years br br the only other sitcom worth mentioning now is two and a half men which really doesn't hold a candle to the other four but is all we have left
<START> i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie it was unbelievable me and a group of friends decided to watch this one night and it was just the stupidest thing any of us had ever seen i couldn't believe it we watched the first 15 minutes in utter awe that somebody actually thought of this and then made it into a movie are they on crack my guess is yes in huge doses i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash is this supposed to be sci fi or comedy or what i don't thing the idiots who made this even care they just decided to make a movie about nothing and see how many suckers they could trick into watching it well we put something on film so let's take it to the movie store and see if they actually put it on the shelf no no no this is not movie making the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is i feel like going to the movie store and complaining and getting my money back nobody should have to endure this crap so i am here to warn you do not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen
<START> i was unfamiliar with this film until i saw it included in a list of the top 20 spaghetti westerns i recently came across following the marathon i made these last few weeks of films from the subgenre it was auspicious then that the film had to turn up almost immediately on late night italian tv for the first time i'm pretty sure in a good number of years br br unfortunately the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast hasn't been great lately i recorded the film on vhs but i decided not to keep it due to this factor as it happened the very next day i watched the film i found out that it was available on a region 2 dvd from italy featuring an interview with uncredited scriptwriter ernesto gastaldi and having been sufficiently impressed i decided to order it there and then even if i knew that i wouldn't be getting to the dvd for quite a while as i like to allow some time between one viewing of a film and the next a brief parenthesis here when i recently purchased a spate of spaghetti westerns on italian dvd i opted not to order sergio face to face 1967 since i was under the impression that it was a bare bones affair however i've just learned that the disc actually contains an interview with the director as had been the case with the big 1966 which i bought it did seem baffling to me that wouldn't offer similar contribution to that film's dvd edition when he actually considered face to face as his favorite work as per the director's talent bio included on the blue underground region 1 disc of yet another spaghetti western run man run 1968 the trouble is that i loved the big so much that i followed it with a viewing of face to face via the recording i owned made off italian tv i did order the dvd of that film now especially since it's still discounted but as i said with respect to a second look at the price of power although i may still check out interview when the disc arrives br br o k rant over the film under review is quite an unusual spaghetti western and a very interesting indeed ambitious one at that being a transposition of the jfk assassination case to an old west setting actually it's reminiscent of anthony mann's terse black and white thriller the tall target 1951 which dealt with an assassination attempt on the life of then u s president abraham lincoln it features one of the most popular italian stars from this subgenre giuliano gemma in what is perhaps his most impressive western role many of his other films tended to have a light hearted bent the supporting cast includes at least two other notables van johnson in one of his few and mainly unremarkable italian films as the american president killed in post civil war dallas and fernando rey as the head of a conspiracy of southerners who not only plots his assassination but also conveniently maneuvers the new acting u s leader johnson's vice president by means of blackmail br br benito also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who pursues gemma all through the picture and with whom he's engaged a couple of times in a in the dark' with the guns resting on the floor rather than in their respective holsters and the only light in the room provided by the end of the cowboys' cigars also involved is ray saunders as black sidekick whom the narrative eventually turns into the doomed lee harvey oswald figure stelvio who later cut his teeth as director on a number of is behind the film's luminous cinematography similarly luis enrique supplies yet another great euro cult score which is different enough from the style of ennio morricone as to be equally distinguishable direction here may mot be as imposing as that in other spaghetti westerns but he handles the proceedings efficiently enough the final gunfight is especially nicely done the film is certainly one of the more underrated entries in the subgenre and for those so inclined the novelty of the plot line alone should make it one to look out for
<START> saw this film during the mod rockers fest in august i was so inspired and touched harry had an amazing life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded for those of you who don't know about harry nilsson do a little research and you'll see that harry has probably found his way into your life in one way or another maybe it was his 70s special the point or everybody's talking from midnight cowboy for me it started with people let me tell you bout my best friend the theme song from the courtship of eddie's father watching this film you can really feel the love and admiration from harry's true friends and peers don't shed a tear for harry he had a ball br br brett
<START> it's been said before strangers on a train is hitchcock's best movie and he's made so many good ones like other hitchcock strangers on a train requires your full attention to really appreciate it but once you can you will
<START> lucio fulci was famous for his italian splatter movies mostly his undead films like zombie or the beyond here he directed a black comedy of sorts but there's just one problem its nauseating i say this knowing that i like city of the walking dead which is also gross but not like this a compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash the film makes this plan look that easy i guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank so they always had their cash on person after the murder i began to suspect what i've always heard about fulci he hated women he must have at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies avoid this film at all costs
<START> first off i am in my mid 40's been watchin horror films since i was a kid so i have seen a lot of variety imo this is not as bad as the multitudes that gave this a 1 or 2 br br yes it is a low budget horror flick the dialog is soso and acting tolerable sometimes the basis of this film plotwise is actually pretty good for those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to have seen them on dvd this is very much like a 1970's movie of the week just add in blood and minor gore minor t a and swearing without big names that is it to a t i would rather watch this than jason vs godzilla or whatever other crap is out there tho not as good evil dead was a low budget film at least give these guys credit for trying with mil budget this could have been a pretty good flick my score a watchable 4
<START> i won't say anything about music because this topic can be so deep that it can become one huge separate review so let's concentrate on movie that is brilliant no doubt one of the best works of forman br br the simple story about love friendship freedom and ideals oh yes the ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go in war br br there is not a single fake word single fake character single fake feeling in the story because the love freedom and friendship isn't something complicated for the characters of movie these things aren't something that everyone can view from different angle these aren't things that need much thinking to understand their love is simple their friendship is simple their ideals are as simple as the word simple itself and that's why these characters are so deep br br berger the leader of a hippie played by treat williams is a guy who lives to live and that's the biggest happiness for him he has his ass as he sings in one of the scenes in the movie and that's enough to make him happy with his property br br berger never accepts that something can't be done and his right if he wants to go to some rich guys' banquet in his dirty old clothes and huge long hair he will do it if he want's to go to another state to just see his friend he'll do it he never thinks twice he just do it br br how why is he so powerful the answer is simple because he is free br br just watch how the wind makes the hair wave in this movie and you will understand it all maybe you will even free yourself too
<START> a harrowing masterpiece on the sheer madness and despair of war fires on the plain is not going to be to everybody's taste this is a war movie in the truest possible sense of the term one that resorts neither to flag waving patriotism nor saccharine sentimentality cuts deep it's ugly tenebrous and bleak as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be this is war behind the cannons with no triumphs or heroes no moral victories or defeats to be had just a handful of gaunt and terrible looking men strewn across a land ravaged by war like penitents fleeing a great disaster the characters defy moral judgment because they are creatures beset by a great woe a woe that does not permit questions of a moral nature war and survival pitting one's will against the other's in a battlefield arena the loser is simply removed from existence br br tamura soldier in the japanese imperial army is discharged from his platoon and ordered to report in a nearby hospital on account of him coughing blood and being disliked by the rest of the platoon he's told to never come back and instead commit suicide by hand grenade in case the hospital rejects him which it does the hospital is nothing but a shack made of wooden planks and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he's capable of walking he's just fine it is in that shabby excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place as the area is carpet bombed by american planes the doctors and those who can walk and sustain themselves flee from the hospital and into the woods moments before the hospital is blown to pieces the gaunt and crippled figures of the sick and injured crawl out of it in every manner of posture dressed in their sickly white robes as if the building is some kind of beast spewing viscera and filth out upon the earth br br that is greatest success the stark and brooding depiction of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images without melodrama or pseudo heroism soldiers cross a marsh wading knee deep in mud move across the opposite bank and into a field only to discover enemy tanks hiding in the woods their lights shining like malignant eyes as they scan the dark a procession of injured soldiers dirty and half mad crossing a road dropping to the ground on the sound of enemy planes buzzards feasting on a pile of dead bodies an abandoned village a mad soldier that believes himself to be buddha sitting under a tree covered with flies and his own excrement offering his arm to be eaten by tamura when he's dead these are the images kon ichikawa conjures for our eyes merciless and unflinching in their poignancy but honest and raw br br doesn't rush to get somewhere it is content to follow travels through the war torn land as he tries to reach the regrouping center of and observe the madness and obscenities of war the movie wades through the sludge of the horror of war slow and brooding just like the characters it follows the final thirty minutes with tamura taking refuge with two who feed on 'monkey are the closest comes to adhering to conventional narratives and they're no less powerful for that matter strikingly photographed in black and white with great performances from the cast and assured direction is not only among the best war movies to be made but also among the finest of japanese cinema
<START> this conglomeration fails so miserably on every level that it is difficult to decide what to say it doesn't merit one line much less ten but to adhere to the rules of imdb here goes and i probably won't succeed the first time around and have to type some more to make up for this submission to be accepted lol br br if i had seen this schlock during the '70s while i was going through my mushroom phase i would have still considered it unimaginative and shallow the most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door opened and closed i was on the edge of my seat br br one person on here wrote that he had met the creator of this mess as if that were a red letter day in his life one can only pray that something far more exciting occurs in that posters life get a grip amigo
<START> 80's comedies especially ones with john cusak are awesome almost all are hillarious and instant classics and this film is no exception plenty of nods to other films i e godzilla and jaws through out the movie that are so hillarious you'll be laughing for hours some may complain that the movie is a little corny at times but hey it was the 80's and things were always a little cheesy throw in a young demi moore and an even louder bob cat and you have a laughfest on your fans if you haven't seen this you better soon
<START> having already seen the original jack frost i never thought that jack frost 2 would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again a pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first a pix sequel and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more a pix sequels br br it's hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring which are essentially snowballs with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first jack frost had no such effects br br i'd strongly recommend that you see the original jack frost before seeing this one both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense sense being a relative term br br now only if there was uncle sam 2
<START> is one bad movie this doesn't even rate in the so bad its good category it's just bad from the lack of set design to the acting to the special effects everything about this movie stinks for starters the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an oscar candidate and to top it all off there's the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage the towns that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew's train set so obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer the only good thing about the movie is the monster suit its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film and maybe a decent script would have helped too
<START> my only question is why did they make this movie did they have a script or did they make it up as they went along boom boom doesn't look like a charley davis john garfield probably turned over in his grave if he saw this
<START> an expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous african jungle in search of both a fortune in diamonds and a missing young lady named diana luscious brunette looker katja clad solely in a skimpy loincloth that shows off a lot of her hot shapely body who's worshiped as a goddess by a deadly primitive tribe called the director screenwriter jess franco crucially fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally blah and meandering proceedings allowing the sluggish pace to crawl along at an often agonizingly slow clip and staging the infrequent action scenes with a singular lack of skill and panache the lousy dubbing excess amount of grainy national geographic like animal stock footage groovy jazzy lounge score terrible acting talky uneventful narrative tepid soft core sex scenes and static photography don't help matters any as well fortunately there's plenty of tasty gratuitous nudity on sight to alleviate the tedium to a reasonable extent besides the delectable both aline mess as fierce wicked high priestess and mari carmen as the conniving treacherous lita are likewise real easy on the eyes the beautiful jungle scenery is very nice too but overall this picture sizes up as barely watchable and hence instantly forgettable swill
