<START> this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think it s more enjoyable than the original maybe that s why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit it s a good not great movie br br most if not all fx were done by c g i which i didn t mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie phil chris was in my opinion the best guy in the movie julie delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the movie br br there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say driller killer suspiria dario argento s movie thats to name but two br br this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people s collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i ll get the original at some point maybe i have only one complaint and that is phil chris should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was fine br br rating for this movie 8 10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there br br
<START> i normally don't try and second guess a crime thriller but cleaner was just entirely too predictable samuel l jackson playing the character tom along with his profession created an interesting twist in the beginning of the film however that was about it without even thinking i knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes i had already figured out who the killer was rather then trusting myself and having seen several films that make a i watched to its completion what a disappointment i was right from the beginning br br the casting of characters was a good as well as the acting from jackson and harris except for eva mendes from the starting gate she didn't play a believable character in correlation to the script and this ruined the entire plot too soon maybe this was a directing mishap or just weakness in the story itself her role as ann should have shown more emotion and distress for the situation that was building around her this would've made the build up a bit more compelling and the ending more dramatic nevertheless cleaner is watchable not memorable i've seen episodes of csi that were more thrilling then this
<START> if you like bad movies and you must to watch this one here's a good one not quite as funny as the first but much lower quality a must see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing
<START> yes they finally got it down to perfection what a great idea a refreshing exploitation epic for generation x whether they know it or not after disasters like sgt nypd and getting screwed by blockbuster our hero lloyd kaufman just decided to go for it stop catering to distributors and let troma be all the troma it can be lloyd would make this one the most unapologetic outlandish and downright hilarious troma movie yet this time lloyd takes shakespeare's love story turns it inside out it and adds that long lost entertainment value it was always lacking entertainment value such as the narrator debbie rochon the cook joe the fat guy and of course brutal mutilations and toilet humor tromeo and juliet is the definitive edition of a rather lackluster story and the crown jewel of the troma universe br br years ago in tromaville n j business partners monty que and cap capulet start a film company called silky films which would produce supposedly tasteful soft core films monty considers cap his friend but cap is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the company on paper and in books it appears that monty gave away his life's work for free fast forward to mid 90's manhattan we have two families who are extremely displeased with one another it's to the point that they're just looking for a reason to take a limb or preferably a life monty has a son tromeo nephew benny they with their friend murray martini who's just a little too excited about all the carnage wage war on the incestuous capulets except monty he's too drunk to care like in the original there is a confusing situation leading to tromeo falling for daughter who he has never met or never even knew about unfortunately cap is a sadistic pervert who not unlike dad has a thing for the bottle and this would of course lead to daddy's little melon being physically and emotionally abused and molested and kept in a plexiglas cage off and on depending on how foul of a mood cap is in cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry london arbuckle a billionaire butcher who would make just about anyone uneasy with or without the loaf with all these inconveniences the young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision but how will this effect the big feud it might or might not go a little something like the original but figuring out how this one ends up is just simply not going to happen you'll never see it coming br br the one with leo is downright sleep inducing compared to tromeo juliet but if watered down over directed big budget hollywood garbage is what you've been programmed to go for then by all means go for it but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful something that really packs a punch and doesn't follow the normal movie pattern and if you happen to have a rather abnormal sense of humor then you just might not hate this movie tromeo and juliet gives the finger to all that is mainstream full blast exploitation with as much mean spirited humor as anything from a young john waters along with some badass acting tromeo and juliet flaunts a thunderous score which includes the legendary motorhead and not to mention much input from james gunn that really brought this one together for more awesomeness from james gunn check out and for more excellence from lloyd kaufman check out his next vision terror firmer tromeo and juliet is jaw droppingly priceless exploitation for the 90's brought to us by the one and only king of the b movies thank's lloyd 10 10
<START> in da moonlight is the first showcasing of jeff daniels writing and directing talents br br i've seen worse debuts but this one isn't that great br br in da moonlight starts off like as a decent parody of this part of american culture as we follow jeff daniels on the eve of deer hunting season 1989 he is getting close to the record of oldest to never bag a buck br br the film takes places in the upper regions of michigan and has all the normal cliche characters but there is a warmth there that tells you this isn't being mean spirited br br well reuben is heading off to the deer camp and before his wife kimberly norris guerrero gives him a native american necklace his lucky hat and two forms of liquid you probably don't want to know about br br anyway she is really the only one who believe in him he finally gets to the camp where his dad presnell is waiting and his brother joey albright is soon to show br br okay let's fast forward this in here there are some laughs a few moments when i chuckled a loud but most of the jokes here are used a few to many times br br but the biggest draw back is the spiritual native american happenings just when you settle in with the characters these strange things occur but the special effects are so cheap all it is is a big flash of light and then head quickly bobbing back in forth br br and the ending well it is worthless br br the move itself wasn't bad the quirky character and fun parody were good but it should've stayed at that instead of having stupid spiritual awakenings that look like rejected scenes from some demon possession movie br br i give in da moonlight a 4 5 out of 10
<START> yes thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie the acting is below average and the special effects are horrible in fact the worst i have ever seen it is a very low budget movie there is no way this movie will can scare you it has no creepy or scary moments mr bone eater was more of a funny creature for me it could have been much better but oh well they didn't had a big budget the movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie lol i would name this movie the time eater waster i am sure you would have a lot of better movies etc to watch still watch it if 1 you have nothing else to watch 2 you get to watch it for free not worth renting at all
<START> it is fitting that the title character in sydney white is defined from the beginning of the film by her awkwardness because the film like the character tends to begin every scene with a well meant but inappropriate statement then inadvertently making it worse and leaving the viewer in total confusion br br this scenario gets old quick now imagine a hour and a half of this throw on the most predictable storyline imaginable add some vague snow white and the seven dwarfs references and amanda bynes blinking in wide eyed puzzlement and you have sydney white for more of my review http www helium com items sydney white review
<START> this film is hard to knock it follows in the tradition of pulp fiction yet succeeds further by stamping its own unique style the cast is awesome the script is great and things like the odd pulp fiction esque time sequencing is done brilliantly i particularly like how the images provided in flash back vary dramatically depending on who is telling the story at the time when it is one of the indoctrinated criminals everything is flashy and cool but when it is the hero's recollection everything is skanky and disgusting br br this is an awesome film and so i am extremely annoyed to find that i cant buy it anywhere
<START> my companions were astounded to find that this movie was a documentary it was so funny it seemed scripted yet it gives a stirring picture of real life in the indie film life we felt moved to purchase coven and wanted to meet mark and mike as college students this film gave us a much needed glimpse of real life
<START> i have seen this movie but not in a single sitting what happens it that it is playing on the tv i watch for a few minutes find that i have take all that i can take and then leave the room during those few minutes i do not laugh once experience no pleasure in what i am viewing and find myself more depressed that angry interestingly i am told the psychological states are incompatible that is one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time this movie tests that theory br br i think part of the problem is that i spent nearly ten years in chicago so as i am watching the scenes i am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus i am clearly bringing a lot of my baggage to the piece it is entirely possible i am willing to concede that if you are not a chicago denizen you will find the piece amusing if so i envy you br br and yet john hughes set his films in chicago and those movies worked for me i think the difference is that hughes was a first rate writer i think it obvious he knew how to comically balance his situations as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable in a comedy as distinguished from a farce this balance vital and it is not easy to achieve if it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to fret as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear in adventures in babysitting it doesn't i hated those characters br br there is a difference profound and real between sympathetic and simply pathetic br br for me every scene in this movie is a clunker there is no humor no humanity no people one can recognize just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to restrain themselves from screaming them out certain that finally hilarity will ensue this time for sure it's like watching the antics of very bad comedians it's embarrassing and after a while usually at the point when i get up and leave i start to feel pity for all concerned which is a kind of emotional connection i suppose elizabeth shue is terrible she doesn't act certainly not act comically and it's entirely possible she can't but lord how she tries she looks older than 17 and acts way younger like a seven year old straining in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award and she is not alone it is as if everyone cannot relax and let the tale flow as if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing br br now this was an early effort for chris columbus and he clearly would improve and having better writers e g john hughes himself certainly helped so perhaps some forgiveness is in order but the film just reeks of desperation yet like i said it may work for some if any of the above appeals to you and it clearly did some of the reviewers then go get the dvd and knock yourself out otherwise avoid this mess like you would a dark chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats
<START> mark blankfield from the old late night tv show fridays plays dr daniel jekyll a mild mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug crazed party animal this was not of course his intent he had higher aspirations but he goes with the flow this is actually a fairly stupid movie but it's also pretty fun of course once the good doctor realizes what he's done he's ashamed but he's also not above doing it all again running through hollywood as a crazed sex machine with out hair gold chains there's a few subplots like fiancÃ©e who is the daughter of the head doctor at our lady of suffering and pain employer and there's tim thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few real parts and a taste for men and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of howard hughes and who is going to make several people rich with a complete set of organ transplants including testicles yeah the humor is raunchy and silly and overall the whole thing is fairly tasteless but if you're not above a quick wallow in the gutter you'll probably like it just fine now available on dvd too for the first time woohoo 7 out of 10
<START> this was truly the most painful experience i have had in quite some time in a movie theater i will forego such facile criticisms as or or crap's crap' because quite simply our sympathies would then immediately go out to these words if a director's to make a sweeping grandiose love epic well for god's sake make a real damn sweeping grandiose love epic why bother with such laughably unconvincing second rate harlequin romances and such boring interchanges between characters we could care less about when the most decisive battle on canadian soil is taking place and for the pompous people thinking 'oh well this story must center characters well you're wrong dead wrong
<START> i's a big struggle as a story that is surreal this movie could've been great as great as it is rated by some here but mixed with the acting director and relatives playing major roles due to financial reasons i reckon found in here although calling this acting is not only a stretch of that word it's giving it a new meaning a whole new meaning br br if you are into surreal movies there are some that i do like actually see the japanese strange circus for example you might be able to overlook the flaws see above and enjoy this more there are great ideas here after all many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes but while watching this with a group of friends almost all of us just couldn't stop laughing not the intention of the director of course again everyone has their own liking as one can see by the high rating of this movie but i could only recommend the movie if you're aware of the work that alejandro jodorowsky has done and or are a fan of his
<START> i have had this movie in the back of my head sense i saw it i have wanted to tell people about it time and again but never remembered now i found it now finally i can tell people precisely what the absolute worst most crappy movie i have ever seen in my entire life bar none is br br this movie is complete trash and is unfit for a garbage dump all prints and other copy's of this movie should be rounded up loaded into a large rocket and launched into the sun only the purifying heat and pressure of the sun might be able to purify the materials this movie is stored on so that they can be useful to the universe again br br i like movies i like bad movies and yes this is an opinion but this movie was pure trash filth and excrement of some beast that should never be seen let alone named by man br br i would rather watch a uwe boll movie marathon than watch this movie and i hate uwe boll's films
<START> let's see how many ways you can insult my gender 1 of course girl 1 is a horrible skank who cheats on her boyfriend and sounds looks like a heroin addict br br 2 of course girl 1 sleeps with the guy on the first date after getting wasted br br 3 of course the lesbians are butch germans who are into s m br br 4 this one was actually a surprise ending the movie on a note of torture celebrated by the majority of characters was sickening seeing a woman beaten isn't my idea of comedy br br 5 director's commentary talking about hooking up with actresses in the movie just so you know is crass and incredibly unprofessional
