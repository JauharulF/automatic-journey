<START> i work at the video store that rents this video in lexington and i must say it should have never been made i even know some of the people who worked on it who regret doing so bad effects horrid acting bad script especially i swear the dialog wouldn't have passed for the original resident evil it's that bad if you want to know how not to make a movie watch this film to learn a thing or two if not don't waste your time and even the director know it sucks because he keeps coming in to try to get us to the movie no sir i've watched two thirds of the horror section and this rates even lower than plan 9 from outer space even ed would have said nope that's too stupid even for me
<START> this is not the true story it is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events it endorses suicide morose obsession with death a totally gratuitous at organized religion in general and the anglican church in particular and generally provides a nihilistic pointless world view from which filmgoers i suppose are intended to walk away richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessness br br utter trash though attractively performed by a capable cast that anyone would suggest this is a true rendering however is very much false advertising you want the real story rent tale' that's the real story see if you can find any correspondence between the facts presented in either case i only found one the girls who made the original photographs were pre pubescent
<START> where do i start the plot of the movie which is about a love between two high school students during wartime while one is a living weapon and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot it is based on a manga by shin takahashi which was also turned into an anime in 2002 both of which i have yet to read or see br br this review is about this live action adaptation however sadly this honest to goodness was a terrible movie it isn't as if one could site certain aspects and say for instance the budget is at fault or the acting is to blame it is sadly a series of underwhelming and ineffectual elements that bring this film down br br the acting is poor not to say aki maeda and are bad actors but they didn't have much to work with and seemed miscast neither seemed to have the physical range to draw the viewer in the story as well as being too old for their parts to a distracting degree br br the script was weak the leads act unrealistically and behave irrationally the film also plays for the heartstrings but ends up being predictable all the while not being compelling and under developing the characters there are also pacing issues br br visually it is unremarkable the film uses green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes the other special effects also have a cheap look to them especially where minimalistic practical special effects could have been used there is also no visual flair as if there were no cinematographer or art designer to make the scenes look consistent and stimulating br br the music and sound effects were fine but unremarkable br br overall the movie isn't devoid of enjoyment and fans of the series shouldn't be discouraged to see it at least once just for the sake of completion people unfamiliar with this probably isn't the place to jump in as it isn't a very good movie or melodrama it isn't the movie or the cast and crews fault it just isn't inspired and that is what kills it
<START> when a friend once lambasted me for my first movie a pretty bad videotaped affair i argued that i could grow orson welles' first movie indeed was even worse he challenged me that it couldn't be so i pulled out the criterion laserdisc of i think citizen kane and played hearts of age my friend lasted just a few minutes before conceding the point br br there is a little humor in this short but it's basically as pretentious as and perhaps a collegiate answer to blood of a poet and other avant garde films of the time it is what it is a succession of images with a vague theme and unless you really enjoy any footage of welles in heavy makeup to boot this isn't really even worth tracking down
<START> poorly acted and poorly directed congo unsuccessfully tries to recreate the feeling of jurassic park but the truth is the book wasn't all that great either still the movie's first problem is that tim character was added the second problem is that the talking arm was added the main problem though is that the cast members don't create realistic characters i guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth also starring laura linney happy birthday laura dylan walsh ernie hudson grant heslov joe don baker james karen and bruce campbell i'm guessing that they don't wish to emphasize this movie in their resumes
<START> i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this b movie in it's entirety br br all i have to say is save your time and money this has got to be the worst b movie of all time it shouldn't even be called a b movie more like an f movie because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie the story is not interesting at all all of the actors are paper thin and not at all believable it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it's almost funny almost br br the movie is just packed full of crappy one liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit br br this movie is supposed to be geared towards men but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end they try to appear sexy in those weird horrible costumes and they fail miserably br br even some of the most ridiculous b movies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch
<START> this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd i loved those six movies they were well acted well scripted and historically accurate i did actually read gregory's book and liked it well enough despite it's huge historical inaccuracies i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george boleyn in particular but this movie didn't even mention that that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book br br above all this movie just leaves me asking why why do we see as someone else aptly put the real world tudor england why are the camera angles so bad in general br br why is the script so bad i mean i know it was improv but come on the actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and it's obvious that they're making them up as they go along br br why are the sex scenes so awkward the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting in the movie they're just bad verging on being absolutely hilarious at one point the actress playing mary boleyn was having sex with the actor playing henry viii he's thrusting away and she's got this look on her face that says hm i need to go to the store is he done yet maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick it's just bad br br why does catherine of aragon play such a small role in this movie her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked she's the reason why henry viii and anne boleyn couldn't get immediately married why is she not present here over all this movie is just bad
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen a movie that is about a stupid looking monster from the ocean that threatens a small town which has to be filled with the dumbest people on earth br br spoilers if you even care br br they can't even kill the damn thing by the end of the movie the movie ends and they're like well some day we'll have to kill it br br avoid at all costs
<START> i had before a feeling of for all russian films but after seeing this film i havenÂ´t this is a unique masterpiece made by the best director ever lived in the ussr he knows the art of film making and can use it very well if you find this movie buy or copy it
<START> certain aspects of punishment park are less than perfect specifically some of the acting however i feel that this is probably the most important movie of the war on terror era i grew up hating hippies and in some respects i still do it wasn't until the united states was started down the path of an unnecessary and deceitful war in iraq that i began to see the world through their eyes i can feel what they must have felt although the film is somewhat dated watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface it's clear enough early in the film that punishment park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the unpatriotic elements of american society this is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society but it is credible at times i find myself believing that the usa could easily slip into fascism as i watched this film i could only think about how i hear similar sentiments from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily this movie is a raw concentrated of america's present political scene i am both impressed and saddened that something this relevant and yes accurate was filmed more than 30 years ago if you take a more moderate view of the movie and choose to believe that this couldn't happen here look more closely at guantanamo bay some of our enemy combatants the rumored cia secret prisons and the many incidents similar to the one in nc in 1979 8 full years after the making of this movie
<START> i ve seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the first time in it s unrated version which is soft core porn at it s best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by b queen linnea quigley and burt ward robin from the old batman series
<START> it's weird this film you get the impression that the makers of this snooze fest spent more time in the local bars than on set in fact it's a surprise not to see harry alan towers' name on the credits it certainly has the flavour of one of his tax shelter productions but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for all involved to enjoy a prolonged stay in provence despite the fact that the film is supposed to take place all over the region les and the area around it stands in for almost everything br br david birney makes for a spectacularly colourless hero as michael says at one point you're a walking clichÃ© what is doing in this is anyone's guess for some reason the most interesting character played by rampling is sidelined whereas regardless of the book she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the skill to carry the movie which would have been dull anyway but at least we'd have got more of something pretty to look at br br all in all a pointless affair that is only worth watching to see how action less an action movie can be
<START> parrots parrots i have been around this old earth longer than most and have seen nearly all the westerns that have have produced old west history is my passion comanche moon is one of the most poorly produced directed and acted stories i have ever seen there was very little historical accuracy but then it is obvious you were operating on a shoestring budget which br br played a distinct roll in this insult to intelligence i am happy that i this show it was bad enough having to sit and watch the movie plus put up with the inane commercials once again there was not one actor that came anywhere near convincing i kept hoping it would improve as the three days progressed wrong i'm ashamed to say i wasted 4 1 2 hours of what precious little time i have left
<START> synopsis andreas finds himself alone on a coach getting dropped off on a desert land at what seems the last stop of his journey he doesn't know how he arrived there but a welcome sign has been erected for him after momentarily pondering his whereabouts he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life he then enters a world different to the one he came from br br as andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant he senses that his surroundings are a bit too uniformed for his liking as he takes his first lunch break he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits on this same day he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing spikes of what looks like an act of suicide the strange thing is the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened it is quick to see that these people are genetically and their ability to distinguish between anything humane or inhumane is absent br br to help andreas settle in he is invited to go out with his co workers to a local nightclub the club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night and as andreas drinks his sorrows aways he realises that no matter how much he drinks the alcohol has no effect on him as he tells these observances to a stranger in the men's room a man in a toilet cubicle starts to utter words which have been on mind all along realising that this man is thinking what he is he follows him to his house and notes where he lives for future reference the plot predictably evolves with andreas wanting an escape he seeks out the man he once followed hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again but is it too late br br my thoughts this norwegian film is something which everyone should see as it holds the answer to the big question what is the meaning of life well close enough the film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today's working man or woman it's sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be materialistic it tries to show that small clichÃ© things such as the sound of children playing should not be taken for granted because the moment you stop hearing that sound is the moment you're one step away from becoming a robot the ending of the film reiterates what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you've now become used to you start to adopt the saying of 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' and become too comfortable to take a risk of change br br even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism its message is more than real the lack of empathy conveyed in the film and that of which andreas sees is a bold statement of what life can become the director jens has put together a film which in any other director's hands would have failed this is a fine piece of cinematic genius and i eagerly await to see what he does next br br the lead role played by is perfectly cast representing the average joe provides a good catalyst in making this picture darkly humorous the supporting actors also do an apt job and for some reason i feel that keanu reeves would have been perfect in this film as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be emotionless br br the score for this film was beautifully composed the recurring theme was always a delight to listen to and it provided a very sombre but welcomed feel to the movie br br set for a release date in the uk for 25th may 2007 i will definitely be going to re live this experience on the big screen this film has gained its way in my top 10 now quickly becoming my top 20 it has some shocking scenes and is darkly humorous throughout a must see
<START> it is sad that some find this film worth watching i am russian and i am disgusted there is nothing in this film that deserves praise except cinematography however i am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion i think this film is poorly designed and directed there is nothing more irritating and even enraging than shameless speculation in art if you can call this garbage art wanted to shock the viewers by pervasive evil and he succeeded in creating a hopelessly dark film but the biggest shock is primitive directorial work i would never advise any of my friends to watch it huge disappointment
