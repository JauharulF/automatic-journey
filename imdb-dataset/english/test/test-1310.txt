<START> i'm a big fan of kevin spacey's work but this is a sub standard film if you think it looks interesting or you saw it and liked it go and check out john boorman's the general it is basically about the same guy but is far superior in every way and doesn't suffer from the hollywood
<START> wow talk about a film that divides the audience this is a real love it or loath it kinda movie personally i really enjoyed it i noticed that other reviews are comparing it to pitch black this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is sand people can be real stupid no this film is far more in common with the thing how people fail to notice is amazing they even have the same basic music lots of carpenter touches are there blue collar heroes sharp humor endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is it's deference to other carpenter works not least dark star which it has something in common with i'd be interested to know how much it really cost 8000 is that even possible maybe it was based on a short film that cost 8000 but i did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died they are so underplayed that it's like watching a documentary at times having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and i'm not sure the big guy playing the captain is one of them but his gun is awesome give it a chance if you like early carpenter you might fall for it just don't expect 2001
<START> one of the most underrated comedies dan akroyd is hilarious in this over the top role charles grodin gives a performance nearly as good as in midnight run and walter matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued sometimes wacky film akroyd and matthau have great chemistry together
<START> i didn't even watch this whole movie now i like 50's sci fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me for one thing one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade he sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league not a space ship out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at earth and this boob says 'can you see brooklyn ' and another guy says and the boob says 'gee i wonder who's pitching ' pardon me a moment i think my sides are splitting br br when they first get up into orbit the boob says 'the moon is just for looking at take me back down ' watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the g forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film perhaps the film's best moment can be identified by a big the end on the screen br br we also find out that they can't open the hatch because 'the greased it before they took off sure a space vehicle is going to be by a member of the crew who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and doesn't know anything about zero gravity as baby huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said that sounds logical the no gravity in space effects are so bad it's painful to watch everyone knows in the absence of gravity everything tends to go up br br how this movie gets 6 3 stars out of 10 when other vastly superior films don't rate any higher is a mystery to me i really do like old sci fi movies but this one is not realistic and the lame attempts at character humor by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all it just ruins the movie i think in retrospect it's not the whole movie i hate so much as the fact that 'the is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship not even to the hatch ' omg i wonder if he checked the fan belts too maybe if they'd left 'the off the trip it might not have been quite so excruciating even so it's only average what everyone else is raving about i don't know br br you want to watch a neat 1950's space movie x m' beats it all to heck maybe not so much 'realism' but a more serious story and less goofy characters
<START> not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the movies i'm talking about how big productions companies waste so much money in things that actually are boring and not to talk about ridiculous with the millions they used to make a movie like this because i don't think the actors here would actually work for free or for an insignificant sum with that money imagine how many good independent movies you could make or maybe one good hollywood movie its just to rip you off but not anyone just the majority of teens that are willing to go and see an ashton kutcher movie just because they are fans of him i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie if you actually look at it in prospective the actors are the same quality of this movie so i guess i shouldn't be surprise i actually couldn't have expected more
<START> when i first saw this show i was 9 and it caught my attention right away when was trying to call lois on the phone in the hotel i laughed and kept on watching when the episode was finished i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly this separates itself from the simpsons and other shows on say cartoon network because the jokes are more mature not too much but it's tv 14 for a reason the quick film cuts after each punch line and cute funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special talented seth is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show a good theme song and a crazy family that there's always something funny makes this my favorite cartoon along and aqua teen hunger force check it out it's funny stuff
<START> wow this movie is the voice of a climbing generation director sam keith takes us to the darkest depths of man's soul where we find love life and top world weary telly leo fitzpatrick follows his heart and his anchors through a cerebral journey to find sanity in a post apocalyptic colorado instead telly meets confrontation in don jason the embodiment of machismo and a zeitgeist of humanities foibles the epic film comes to a at a gut wrenching top competition that will make even the strongest willed viewers squeamish at the dizzying heights br br this movie has it all top outside top in the gym cut off shorts and sleeveless flannel shirts awesome climbing footage some so good you see it 2 or 3 times bear and snake attacks br br i gave the movie 8 out of 10 because i wanted to see the romance develop a bit more it seemed as if the film was leading up to a spicy top roped sex scene between telly and his new lover but alas it wouldn't fit into the already jam packed hour and a half thrill ride br br fans of cliffhanger and mission impossible ii will find this flick to be a diamond in the rough overall if you are ready to challenge your world view on humanity and climbing this is the film for you 1
<START> this movie is surprisingly good the ninja fighting sequences were unbelievable i haven't see all sho kosugi's films but this is probably the best of those i've seen probably the most impressive fighting sequence was at the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people that was one of the most impressive ninja fighting sequences i've ever seen another good fighting sequence was at a cops funeral where the ninja provide more people to bury the last fight was also very impressive also i kinda liked the soundtrack of this movie the story was good enough for a ninja movie actually it was kinda different from other ninja movies so if you are a fan of ninja movies you'll probably like this one
<START> i got hold of this film on dvd with the title evil never sleeps it gives front cover billing to carrie ann moss but she plays such a minor character that i didn't really notice her in the film br br i'm afraid that i consider this one of the worst purchases i have ever made the dialogue was stilted and the delivery wooden i found the acting to be disconnected from the plot graham's performance to me was of someone who's wondering whether she's left the gas on at home br br all in all both my wife and i found this film painful to watch and it is not a valuable addition to my collection watch it at your peril but spending 90 minutes having your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time
<START> great concept perfect characterizations and voices but a complete waste of time a real shame since had it aimed higher it would probably not have been the bomb it was is way too dependent upon scatological humor for starters i'm amazed by comments from educated reviewers referring to the good science behind this piece of puerile trash unlike finding nemo where with a bit of suspension of disbelief attention to detail was staggering and the science was as good as the context would allow osmosis jones was utter nonsense don't kid yourself about the science humor aimed at eight year olds but subject matter suitable more for some unsophisticated teens
<START> this movie is 1 in the list of worst movies i have ever seen with lessons for an assassin on the 2 spot br br the acting is lousy sorry sandra bullock but even your performance was horrible the music score could have come from a bad x rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous it had this in common with a typical action movie the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one syllable words but contrary to the average action movie there was no real action in this one boring br br the only reason i continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie br br thumbs down on this one
<START> i have to admit i was deceived by the title and the summary on the back of the box so i popped it in the vcr and kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something good to happen but of course it never does the makers of this film should be tied to a chair and made to watch saving private ryan maybe they would learn something
<START> crispin way of acting and not only his is tremendous you really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect he gives this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult as well as which role is done very well by dennis hopper it's about choosing the right or wrong side without logical thinking about the scene friendship is more imported and that's exactly what i think is what makes choices this difficult rivers edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family i really enjoyed it watching i saw it a month ago for the first time but if you like a nice 80s feel this is the one that you have to see i'ts a same that i didn't know of it earlier
<START> john huston finished his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies i've ever seen for his farewell he decided to adapt james joyce's beautiful short story the dead and made not only one of the most faithful literature to film adaptations yet he also crafted a movie that more than 20 years later still surpasses a lot of contemporary cinema br br when i watched this movie a few years ago as a student at university i gazed in awe at the screen marvelling at every aspect of the movie acting screen writing direction costumes settings music cinematography thinking about it now i still can't of anything i'd criticise it for huston just knew how to tell a good story br br a good deal of credit should also go to tony huston he knew better than to meddle with a text that is not only perfection itself but already visual enough for cinema father and son let the story breathe and relish in the long fascinating conversations between characters and in the meaningful silences br br donal mccann also deserves credit for the his performance as gabriel conroy i had never seen him in movies before nor have i seen him afterwards but he gave one of the most moving performances i've ever seen br br all in all the dead is a fine cinematic experience from a legendary director who never stopped being excellent
<START> out of all the bat films batman returns is my favorite this beautiful dark and funny film is one of tim burton's best work although it is much violent and darker this is the batman that creator bob kane envisioned many years ago michael keaton reprises his role as the avenger of gotham city this time he's up against two deadly foes danny devito's penguin and michelle catwoman with a great cast and film score by danny elfman the movie takes us on an adventure as batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over gotham city christopher walken makes a great appearance as max shrek a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve but of course michelle pfeiffer is the one that steals the show with all of these components you have a film that will blow you away this is the reason why you go to the movies it's got everything it's really a shame that tim burton didn't get to direct the other sequels if so i think the franchise would still be going strong today batman returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies
