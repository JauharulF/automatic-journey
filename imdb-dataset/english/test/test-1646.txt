<START> my partner and i sat down to watch this film over a bottle of wine last saturday and although we initially had our reservations once the story got going it was in actual fact rather gripping the scene in which one of the characters in brutally murdered by knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoed the work of korean new wave auteur park chan wook the weapon of choice was a particular masterstroke and allowed us to see into the psyche of heavily altering the connotations of a loving warm grandmother into a murderous hag the dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the innermost paranoia the protagonist selections of mise en scene furthermore enhance the unnerving and atmosphere of the nights events combining with the oscar worthy performances to create a chilling and thought provoking masterpiece the ending which i won't spoil for you here reminded my partner and myself of m night shyamalan's institutional masterwork the sixth sense for it's mind altering twist that has left me thinking weeks after viewing definitely one to watch repeatedly
<START> i can't remember when was the last time i have been so terribly disappointed by any movie probably i expected too much happening in a way you can expect action in dogma style movies of course but there is just nothing going on in here luckily i was watching it at home and could switch channels whenever the silence and dumb numb faces started to kill me and that was very often it really isn't too much of a pleasure watching ugly people who don't talk and move slowly stroke pigs and french kiss men not to mention ugly bodies having explicit sex if only it made any sense the whole murder situation is ridiculous seems like it was only created to show one more vagina since zero characters are capable of actually solving the crime having only four pseudo developed characters and a movie going nowhere it is pretty soon obvious whom the director picked as a killer and that makes no sence either despite all the boredom and suffering i must admit that it somehow touched me in an unexplainable way maybe you should check it out yourself though i don't recommend it
<START> it was definitely worth viewing i don't regret that but also it was kind of ordinary something that i would expect from a movie titled like that love story was nice to watch humour was involved but nothing surprised or spooked me shooting tough guys etc ain't worth it any more
<START> i found this movie to be educational entertaining and very moving i was impressed when i learned of just how much justice had contributed in during her time in kosovo br br wendy crewson is highly under rated and it is good to see her again in a canadian production other easily recognizable stars are leslie hope 24 and john corbett sex in the city br br while the story line of this movie may not be completely factual it did leave me with the desire to learn more about the word of a great movie for inspiring young women br br i say the movie is a must see
<START> brainy cross dressing little boy finds success on the spelling bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing shirley maclaine directed and stars as the child's grandmother and it is always fascinating to see long time actors getting their chance at directing a film the material that they're drawn to and the actors they choose to work with here the only person well cast in bruno is maclaine the child actors seem to have been picked for their twinkle and cuteness and squishy hearted maclaine holds their close ups for excruciatingly long periods nothing about these cherubs seems natural not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other as the boy's disgruntled father poor gary sinise hovers around the edges in mock shame always with a pained look on his face towards the end of the film maclaine turns the whole thing into a of hugging scenes and even concludes with the kid hugging the pope in rome another ungodly treatise from a talented actress turned director who much like sally field and her film beautiful cannot seem to stop winking at and nudging the audience shirley uses ethnicity for shtick and childhood innocence as a punchline the children in this cast roll their eyes crack wise with mature comments use big words but when one mealy mouthed boy calls our pint sized hero gay maclaine's granny instructs him to go over and punch the kid out in front the media how's that for progression from
<START> flipping through the channels i was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie i must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately i love older films and this is or should be considered a classic one of the most wonderful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl i highly recommend this movie
<START> in 1932 humphrey bogart was a relative unknown an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films and because he was an unknown the movie they gave him was clearly a b movie a quick film with relatively low expectations after seeing it i could see why it would still take bogart many more years and another film studio before he became a household name while the film isn't terrible it certainly isn't good making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today br br bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company however when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way his dreams all seem to go on hold as one of the characters in the film said the combination of the two is like oil and water they just don't mix br br while bogart is throwing away his promising career his sister is going full speed on the road to having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash bogey has no idea his sister isn't the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is bogart's sister all this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable however what follows is one of the dumbest scenes i have watched in a very long time by now the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with bogey's sister whew but because she's now poor and no good for bogart she's about to fly away and kill herself bogey finds out chases the plane on foot jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her this is so utterly silly and ridiculous i found myself laughing out loud up until then i might have scored it a 4 or 5 this sunk the movie to a 3 how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me br br the bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film on top of that it's all wrong for bogart as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s manly and solid better suits the man one of america's great actors but clearly out of his element here br br by the way those who love pre code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one practically everyone in the film believes in and practices pre marital sex and bogey curses in the film things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic production code was adopted in 1934
<START> having read the books and seen the 1982 anthony andrews jane br br seymour version i have to say that this is not good at all br br according to the books percy is supposed to be a seemingly br br foppish aristocrat when he's being percy and witty and clever br br when he's being the pimpernel but here he just looks bored as br br percy and mean as the pimpernel marguerite is supposed to be br br the most beautiful woman in europe not a tired and frumpy looking matron she looks middle aged probably due to br br bad make up richard e grant has done much better things and br br elizabeth mcgovern's acting is uninspired and flat the wit and br br dash of the books and the andrews seymour film is here replaced br br by brawn and flashy editing that just don't make the cut br br i might add that to a person who hasn't seen any previous version br br or read the book it would probably look ok
<START> i absolutely adored this movie as a child and still do as an adult to say that is even an understatement my sister brother and i watched it one year at our grandparents' house during christmas vacation they had taped it from tv our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day not so we became mesmerized they could not have unglued us if they tried it became a cherished yearly tradition we loved everything about it the time the romance the battle scenes the villains etc br br come on who can resist hating that psycho bent with his constant sir classic moreover who can resist cheering wildly when justin falls off the balcony what a triumphant moment i always had a special place in my heart for orry and they were so romantic the theme song alone can get me to tear up a little this movie is incredibly moving and i challenge anyone to stick with it until the very end it's worth it
<START> my best guess is this piece of work will come out on dvd sometime before christmas br br this movie was terrible the time line jumps all over the place this wouldn't be so bad if it left some suspense for the end it was entirely predictable bitch girls pick on outcast outcast wants to know why they hate her so much bitch girls die a terrible death outcast girl goes home and looks crazy outcast girl brought evil spirits with her makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other creepy kid understands what's going on oh and the younger sister not being good enough for mommie sick mother sending younger daughter to bring the golden child home br br to be fair there were some great moments here and there first of all sarah michelle character dies in the first few minutes definite plus didn't see that one coming i didn't expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husband's head either if the movie had kept up those kind of thrills i would have loved it the beginning showed so much promise br br i was disappointed because i enjoyed the first one it made me jump i didn't expect most of what happened and though i questioned some of the movie it was still a fun watch i didn't watch any previews for this the sequel because i wanted to be surprised i was but in the wrong direction
<START> funny thing charlie sheen donald sutherland sam waterston and stephen lang have all had incredible performances who can forget sheen as the callow naif in wall street or sutherland as the the cynical korean war surgeon in mash waterston and lang have both also had successful tv and film careers law and order killing fields de niro's tribeca etc so what in the world would any of these fine actors be doing in a stink bomb like this br br shadow plot of a washington coup d'etat is not really that bad unoriginal maybe but not that bad sure it's been done seven days in may a fine film but with a little tweaking it could still have been entertaining br br shadow main problem is in the execution early in the film sheen political strategist extreme ridiculously and implausibly resolves a potential public relations gaffe by blackmailing a congressman later gunplay with lang's mute hitman tearing up half of what is supposed to be georgetown is explained on the news as gang wars has anyone remotely associated with this film ever lived a day in washington sheen is about 20 years too young way way too young to be so senior in a white house administration sheen's response to avert a political crisis is so ladened with false machismo he looks as though he attended the david hasselhoff school of acting and when was the last time gang wars spread to georgetown we're talking about a section of washington where citizens voted against having a metro stop so that they could maintain their exclusivity br br i agree with another reviewer that this film would have been unbearable without the fast forward button i taped it off hbo a year ago and then took 3 separate viewings to plod through it br br in summary don't buy this film don't even rent this film if you see it at blockbuster run away as fast as you can
<START> for all intents and purposes 'teen might seem like just another lightweight bollywood musical to some extent this might even be true especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses but somewhere behind the scenes either sadashiv who had the 'idea' for this story or who directed the film decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations br br this is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women undecided on whom to choose as his life's partner dev anand's character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times and they with him despite being aware of the other two dev anand's relationship with simi and is particularly interesting in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily there are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars' body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer's maturity the theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism
<START> this movie changes its way a third of the way in its totally pointless boring and stupid i hated this movie so much that i will never watch it again some bad films can be really funny this is just a british art house picture that should never of been made 1 out of 10
<START> the stranger jack matthew lillard arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques max vincent d'onofrio and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons jamie valeria golino that he is jack's brother jamie does not buy his story dominates jack and ties him up to a chair when max arrives jack proposes us 100 000 00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques spanish judges with a wealthy and dangerous collector max invites his stupid acquaintance piece mark boone junior who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from mars to compose the backup team however jack double crosses the collector and then he intrigues jack jamie and piece br br the low budget spanish judges is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast valeria golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor vincent d'onofrio they are not able to save the stupid story further the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work and actually they are silly and not funny my vote is three br br title brazil tudo por dinheiro all for money
<START> dirty harry goes to atlanta is what burt called this fantastic first rate detective thriller that borrows some of its plot from the venerable dana andrews movie laura not only does burt reynolds star in this superb saga but he also helmed it and he doesn't make a single mistake either staging the action or with his casting of characters not a bad performance in the movie and reynolds does an outstanding job of directing it henry silva is truly icy as a hit man br br detective tom sharky burt reynolds is on a narcotics case in underground atlanta when everything goes wrong he winds up chasing a suspect and shooting it out with the gunman on a bus during the melee an innocent bystander dies john woo's the killer replicates this scene anyway the atlanta police department busts burt down to vice and he takes orders from a new boss frisco charles durning of oh brother where art thou in the basement sharky winds up in a real cesspool of crime sharky and his fellow detectives arch bernie casey and papa brian keith set up surveillance on a high priced call girl rachel ward of after dark my sweet who has a luxurious apartment that she shares with another girl br br is seeing a local politician earl holliman of police woman on the side who is campaigning for governor but the chief villain victor vittorio gassman of the dirty game wants him to end the affair is reluctant to accommodate victor so victor has cocaine snorting billy score henry silva of terminate billy blasts a hole the size of a twelve inch pizza in the door of apartment and kills her br br sharky has done the unthinkable during the surveillance he has grown fond of to the point that he becomes hopelessly infatuated with her sharky's mission in life now is to bust victor but he learns that victor has an informant inside the atlanta police department the plot really heats up when sharky discovers later that billy shot the wrong girl and that is still alive sharky takes her into protective custody and things grow even more complicated he assembles his machine of the title to deal with victor and his hoods br br william widescreen lensing of the action is immaculate unfortunately this vastly underrated classic is available only as a full frame film definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the picture especially during the mutilation scene on the boat when the villain's cut off one of sharky's fingers this is a rather gruesome scene br br burt never made a movie that surpassed sharky's machine
