<START> undoubtedly the least among the spaghetti westerns i've been watching lately basically a low brow rip off of leone's the good the bad and the ugly 1966 with three disparate characters one another and occasionally forming shaky alliances in their search for hidden gold leonard maltin rated it a bomb while it's harmless enough it's also totally routine and fatally the three main roles are stereotypes that is to say uninteresting eddie byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his being transported by train gilbert roland is the legendary but ageing mexican bandit his frequent lapses into spanish when excited are quite corny who apparently is still irresistible to women george hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate clint eastwood's man with no name figure director castellari whom i saw at the italian b movie retrospective held during the 2004 venice film festival where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present shows little genuine feeling for the western on the strength of two above average franco nero efforts in the genre i ordered his collaboration with castellari keoma 1976 i'm keeping my fingers crossed now and the film's tongue in cheek approach is equally lamentable
<START> although it is more of a kids movie it still holds its own especially when compared to the more recent assembly line animated films being made the music is fantastic i don't care how old you are you will still find yourself to girls of rock and roll and diamond dolls definatly a must for animation lovers
<START> reading some of the other comments i must agree that some of the very few shortcomings found in this brilliant documentary about one of the 20th century's divas up there with billie holliday bessie smith edith piaf judy garland and mercedes de sosa are justified because initially this was a 6 hours plus tv documentary about her career forma de vida v 1995 1999 far more encompassing and with greater insight into inner world as for the subtitling her songs i'm all for it though the music the voice and the performance may be are universal there is so much poetry in the words just begging to be translated i think this was a conscious choice by the producers they were aiming at the 200 million portuguese speakers in brazil portugal mozambique france east cape verde guinea bissau canada the us south africa st tome and principe goa daman venezuela luxembourg germany and the rest of the portuguese speaking diaspora worldwide as for the lady herself she did not live to see this particular shortened dvd version of the documentary but she was given a preview of forma de vida and it seems to have been to her liking very much so
<START> having grown up with gwtw i shunned both the scarlett sequel book and the mini series until now when i recently viewed the video for the first time i was amazed how much i enjoyed watching timothy dalton's depiction of rhett butler and joanne kilmer's as scarlet i feel scarlet should be judged on its own merits rather than attempting any comparison with the venerable selznick masterpiece gwtw while the scarlet story line and some of the dialogue suffered from lack of inspired writing overall i thought this was a worthwhile dramatization of what might have been between scarlett and rhett
<START> i watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights there is no doubt that even if you enjoyed it it's a bad movie but the important question is why it has a good cast it's lively it's prepared to tackle sex head on with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there which is unusual for a british comedy it also has johnny vegas and mackenzie crook marmite performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past br br what it's principally lacking is charm the characters are impossibly idiotic unbelievable and alienating so that instead of a film of men behaving badly the producers have made game on any mediocre writer wanting to make a film about the sexual attitudes of sexist british men would have got hold of a few copies of loaded zoo or even viz to read sid the sexist and the thing would have written itself instead the producers clearly tried to make up some moronic difficult to care about characters character comedy as opposed to slapstick etc only works if the audience can recognise some human truth to the situation but watching this film is like being told an annoying joke that you know is not going to end up funny but you can't stop it br br sadly the film is also poorly made the plot structure is weak there's little character delineation or development and many of the scenes aren't funny time after time the same lame reggae chips in to divide scenes pointlessly and gratingly there's a lot of needless repetition when you've done one joke about parking outside a sex party you don't need to do it again one wonders what the uk film council saw in the script br br this is a world where most men are rakes and most women are continually up for it the apartment and alfie much the same world view but the producers of this film accept it without criticism thus they've ended up with a kind of inferior update of confessions of a window cleaner somebody british needs to have another go at this kind of thing and do it properly Â a good next project for simon pegg and edgar wright i think
<START> normally i love finding old and some not so old westerns i haven't seen to be the entertainment for the evening it's such a great way to sit back relax and escape the politics and world problems for a few hours but this was not to be the case with this version of the magnificent seven the casting and storyline of this series closely follow the hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment good old get your mind right revisionist history where the 'bad guys' must all be white male confederate in this case and preferably christian if it can somehow be worked into the script it's sad really the best movies out there are now and have always been about simply telling a good story up on the big screen not about forwarding someone's political ideology
<START> i watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations having just graduated college and moved on to real life i was not in a fraternity but a lot of my best buddies were and i got to partake in a lot of the partying that they did in their house so i know what goes on to some extent br br this show is obviously a dramatization not a documentary in any way of greek life or college life for that matter although it does hold a lot of truth albeit exaggerated for the most part if you watch the show for the value it contains as a tv show and nothing more it is very entertaining much like movies such as old school porky's animal house etc if you watch it expecting it to chronicle all of your experiences in your own college life you will probably either be left wanting more or mad that they over dramatize a lot of events
<START> i expected this movie to be absolutely god awful like what dreams may come or the truman show or something well they were selling it off for Â£3 99 in my local hmv and it had giovanni ribisi on the cover you know you cant help but love him and so my friends dared me to buy it and i was sure it was going to be trash maybe thats the only reason i could sit through this movie because my standards were never that high
<START> bob clampett's 'the hep cat' is a distinctly average cartoon only really notable for the fact that it was the first colour looney tune previously looney tunes were all black and white while merrie melodies were in colour the tale of a singing dancing cat's attempts to woo a lady cat and a dog's attempts to catch the cat 'the hep cat' lacks the trademark energy and pace of most clampett shorts to be fair clampett doesn't have a great deal to work with warren foster's script is embarrassingly thin and while he has spun straw into gold with other cartoons clampett doesn't manage it with 'the hep cat' it's often said of clampett that you can't mistake his cartoons for anyone else's and it's generally true but 'the hep cat' is an exception there's flashes of clampett genius such as the chase scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog hey are you following me when the dog confirms that he is the cat simply says oh and the chase immediately resumes unfortunately there's very little of such brilliance on show here knowing who directed it 'the hep cat' is a bitter disappointment we all have off days and this was clearly one of clampett's
<START> first when does this storyline take place it has to take place after the first movie because knows and has her third child but it can't take place after the second movie because doesn't get a girlfriend or wife or something you never see her in the show br br also why is going to school the whole plot of the show is that is going to school so that he can be emperor but wasn't he emperor before this and who's emperor while he learning to be emperor shouldn't that be or was fired in this time line already and if that true why is waiting for him to fail to become plus you know in the first movie he said he was trained from birth to be an emperor by private tutors so he should kinda know what he's doing br br why is a student he's around 25 they stated that in the first movie he's an adult going to high school does everyone think he's a moron i really like but i think because of his age and because everyone know that he is working for he should have been a teacher being a home ec teacher would be right up his alley br br is very unlikable she suppose to be love interest moral compass but a lot of time she comes off bossy and know it all she commonly says thinks i like i should be proud because i am pretty and smart br br she has esp when it comes to and knows whenever he's in trouble when he's cheating or even when he sings the hot hot hottie song in his head even though she does cheer leading school newspaper and keeps straight a in all of her classes br br she seems more interested in using her prettiness to get to do the right thing and do well in school then dating him in fact she seems more motherly to then a love interest br br as i bought up before is trying to get to fail so she become not sure how that's suppose to work with being fired and all seems to be reliving the first movie in every episode in almost every show that she appears in she turns into an animal in hopes of having him fail a class there are only 3 times that i can think of that that didn't happen the jokes about being old aren't as clever in the show as they were the movie and classic jokes about are used to death in the show like the pull the level roller coaster and the lab br br also some other points that don't make sense in this series the fact that whenever is assigned something everyone acts like this assignment will make him pass or fail the class but he seems to pass every assignment given to him so why does one assignment matter so much br br seriously who is ruling the kingdom while this is going on do they have a consul or a steward you never see anyone ruling the kingdom unless has his powers back or is br br why is going to a normal peasant school shouldn't he learning about how to lead a country what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future i could see taking some normal classes on like farming so he would know how to prepare the country for a famine or something like that but knot tying how is that helpful br br now i know that someone is going to say but it not suppose to make sense it's suppose to be funny then they should have more funny things in there all the funny things about the show have been done already in the movie also if they notice some of these huge plot holes why don't they poke fun at them like in the movie for example when and get to the secret lab before and and and can't explain how they got their first br br there are some good points it is nice to see some of the characters from the first movie in the series like and monkey with the bug and his family are still very good characters with a good down earth feel i feel that this series would be amusing for younger children br br in conclusion the series is not as good as the movie that it based on but it may good for younger children
<START> this film coincides with mike comic book mini series red rocket seven and tells the story of an alien who escaped to earth to wait for which ties into the book of revelations and the this is only part of a bigger story if the movie confuses you read too you can easily tell that is used to telling stories with pictures the direction is very good and the effects aren't bad for a 500 budget unfortunately mike used many friends to play the roles and probably didn't have the heart to say that they couldn't act also mike is not showing his writing skills in this movie his dialouge spoon feeds the plot to you and doesn't let you enjoy the characters this was actually disappointing considering his tremendous writing ability shown in his comic books 4 out of 10
<START> i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was the initial precept was promising but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful let's run through the main points plot good initial idea but truly terrible development there were many points when i thought no nobody would do something that stupid the ending was amazingly anticlimactic characterisation all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures i keep trying to think of one that wasn't possibly the mother but that's it music intrusive inappropriate and generally terrible direction totally amateurish cinematography doubt they've heard of it camera angles stability zoom levels often really bad i am totally bemused at how this film has scored so highly it's the worst movie i've seen at the cinema for years if not ever
<START> graphics is far from the best part of the game this is the number one best th game in the series next to underground it deserves strong love it is an insane game there are massive levels massive characters it's just a massive game waste your money on this game this is the kind of money that is wasted properly and even though graphics suck thats doesn't make a game good actually the graphics were good at the time today the graphics are crap who cares as they say in canada this is the fun game aye you get to go to canada in well i don't know if they say that but they might who knows well canadian people do wait a minute i'm getting off topic this game rocks buy it play it enjoy it love it it's pure brilliance
<START> i haven't seen this in years but when i was about 6 i first saw this on vhs and i must have watched it at least 10 times now like i said its been awhile so i might screw up the plot but i remember some columbian terrorists taking a prep school hostage with demands for the head terrorist the wishmaster father to be released from prison now i could just check the plot here on imdb but i'm pretty sure thats right any way a group of boys at the school decide that they're not gonna just sit around and wait to die so they decide to fight back this film has always been stuck in my mind there are so many images that i haven't forgotten like joey's i think death scene or billy spitting in the terrorists sandwiches or the one kids no idea of his name fake asthma attack just a great film it may be films like this that have given me my tolerance for film violence because if i remember right this movie is pretty graphic guys getting mowed down by helicopter machine guns a special forces guys hand getting blown off by a grenade not sure about that but i seem to remember something like that towards the end and the most bloody being the lead terrorist getting capped in the head in gory detail great action great humor good acting wonderful film experience i've got to watch this again after all these years
<START> i only came here to check terror hospital for an alternate title so i'd know what not to pick up not only do i get the original title but i come to find terror hospital is one of seven more aliases this one is a real clunker movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons mostly unintended consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment mostly amusement this has none of that instead the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and way too convenient for the situation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters warily moving from room to room and all this is half of the film forget trying to figure out where anybody is or who they are during darkened or nighttime scenes too you probably won't care anyway there is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old driver's ed movies i er i mean sat through and watched way back in high school really we're talking about mysticism possession and a killer on the loose here not a bad recipe for trash cinema unfortunately there's nothing here to make it even good trash when joined to the aforementioned the bad acting and not so special effects are just that bad acting and not so special effects this one's just trash pure and simple leave it on the rack at the pawn shop or in that box at the yard sale there's a reason its there
