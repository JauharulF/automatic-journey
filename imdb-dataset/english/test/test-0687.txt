<START> i did not expect to enjoy this in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited knowing dylan thomas and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare and this was not it critical and yet appreciative it was it made me cry kiera knightley was superb even with that slightly strained welsh accent and it is a sad tale that they tell dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called woman' of the pr spiel it is cillian the william of the movie a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore his challenge to with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor i this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less and well that is how it was marketed it is not a film about dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it
<START> this was a very strong look at prejudice and group mentality the cast is composed of superb actors doing a remarkable job the sets are beautiful and just a bit stylized the art direction is top notch along with great cinematography the story is taut and shows how prejudice and bigotry can flourish easily it is disturbing for its realistic violence and of a fairly typical community i was very impressed
<START> spoiler begin the movie focuses on three friends samantha summer phoenix chris nick stahl and owen aaron paul the movie starts out with sam and owen as the drug addicts and chris the track star as the one who takes care of them as things get increasingly worse at home for chris he asks sam what the drug is like sam is out of rehab and sober by this point and tells him it makes everything better chris then catches up with owen and they start using it takes chris two times till he is a full time member after some trouble with a dealer and a confession to sam she gets in again so begins the downward spiral for them chris od's when he breaks a promise to sam i want some of the movie to be a surprise he dies sam gets in to college to be an architect and owen gets arrested so ends the story br br spoiler ends minor spoilers throughout br br nick stahl is amazing he will have an oscar one day his portrayal of chris was heartbreaking he was the only one that felt real in the movie as far as drug use goes aaron paul who played owen acted as if he were on speed not heroin summer phoenix was fine she is talented but what can i say nick stahl stole the movie his drugged eyes his slow movements everything was perfect br br the writers needed to show in the movie that is a main reason why people don't want to quit other then that there are hilarious scenes the mall scene and the backstreet boy scene man stahl nailed the reactions right on the head touching sad scenes like the scene between sam and chris in her bedroom after he gets beat up i and the park scene it was realistic too like s am using again when chris wanted to flush the drug down the toilet and chris using again after he goes to even though he had been clean for two weeks the pull was too strong it is all realistic br br watch the movie for a great cast great music and a semi truthful account of drug addiction
<START> now please move on because that's getting on my nerves br br seriously the man behind brilliant pieces like my own private idaho and to die for and others not so brilliant movies i e the unnecessary psycho remake started an experimental phase with gerry which reached its peak with the thought provoking elephant last days had some interesting aspects but was very uneven while paranoid park his new film also has good looking 15 year olds walking around and not much else some cool references to fellini the soundtrack some beautiful pieces by nino and the elegant cinematography by the legendary christopher doyle in the mood for love are the highlights but the movie is just too artsy fartsy and meaningless for its own doom we've had much better coming of age stories and paranoid park brings nothing new i don't see anything artistic about seeing excessive shots of gabe in his underwear or showering or when and 13 year old taylor momsen the little girl from how the grinch stole christmas who plays his cheerleading girlfriend have sex for the first time just because she felt like they had to do it and after they're done she calls her friend to say how amazing it was and you can say from face how traumatic it was everybody knows that they're starting earlier and earlier nowadays movies like thirteen and even elephant itself which shows how lost their minds are in general not only when it comes to sexuality have done a better portrayal of that gus tries to be minimalist and artistic but the final result is just boring and uninteresting his next project milk a biopic about harvey milk starring sean penn will hopefully bring the good old gus back because frankly this obsession over underage kids is almost creepy 4 5 10
<START> hey remember when hal hartley was brilliant what a time that was i'd say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at least he went uphill from this one a movie that looks like it was filmed on someone's cell phone wouldn't have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog but alas those are missing along with hartley's spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary packaged in a trying to be hip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its second half it's never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you hartley
<START> kennedy miller could hardly have done a better job at tackling a very challenging exercise making dry political events work as human drama and providing an even handed representation of explosively controversial subject matter br br the key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting although i was less impressed by max performance as gough than some other commenters here the clear standouts for my money were john stanton as malcolm fraser and bill hunter as rex connor the latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history hunter could not have been more perfect for the role on the second count the series avoids the myth of objectivity trap through a narrator who the sympathies of the director phillip who more recently demonstrated his left wing credentials in rabbit proof fence while being carefully even handed and sympathetic in its dramatic portrayal of all parties the adherence to the lady kerr lady macbeth theme popular among labor partisans was perhaps a little partial though not ruinously so in particular credit is due for the sympathy shown to kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position he was placed in whatever one might think of his actions br br however there is one sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame the portrayal of the jim cairns affair those who come to the series with no background to these events will get the impression that cairns and were the innocent victims of a smear campaign by a prurient gutter press the producers may have been restrained in this respect by australia's stultifying defamation laws and the recently demonstrated willingness of cairns and to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual which cairns would eventually admit to a year before his death however more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which managed office as treasurer br br speaking of defamation there are a couple of disorienting occasions where dialogue is obscured due to taken out by offended principals by a beeping noise on one occasion and a very loud telephone ring on another a further curiosity the dvd release a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer played by the late paul serves on his arrival at sydney airport next in the queue is a dishevelled looking hippie who now receives only a disapproving glare from when he presents his paperwork in the original version said something along the lines of drug bust in bali eh obviously this line no longer rings true in the wake of the schapelle corby case which dramatically illustrated that those busted for drugs in bali can expect far worse than deportation
<START> i remember watching this when it was made and thinking it was brilliant at the time watching it for the second time nearly 20 years later i still think is brilliant and much better than the us film that was based on this drama br br it should also be watched by all our come today gone tomorrow politicians who think they can win the war on drugs as the issues raised in this film are as pertinent today as they were back then at the end of the 80s and unless they change their policies will be so in another 20 years br br well written well made beautifully acted and superbly filmed a thought provoking drama that entertains as well as brings to light some of the hard realities of the criminal drug trade
<START> horrendously acted and completely laughable haunted house horror flick that has an out of place anna paquin playing a neurotic teenager fighting off the things that go bump in the dark that are plaguing her and her family shortly after moving to their new home in spain little more than a geographically re planted rip off of the shining and most notably the others the weak plotted darkness is basically your typical run of the mill b horror feature with a few predictable lame scares that can be seen by audiences a mile off so to speak in retrospect i suppose i shouldn't have set my personal expectations quite as high for this movie to actually be good considering the well known fact that it was shelved for nearly three years before finally being released around christmas of last year in american cinemas across the country to what was ultimately lukewarm ticket sales and very harsh reviews from critics when will filmmakers ever learn that there's more to making movies be it horror or otherwise than just the fey possibility of a little financial gain turkey zero stars
<START> i was a little to old for this show i was 6 when it first came out first off when i was a young child there were a few children's shows that were on sesame street which i did watch and learned from but other than that there wasn't much else my cousins were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one more came latter barney was a very big part of what they watched when i first saw this show i told my grandmother how it doesn't teach anything just uses magic to fix everything i was 9 at the time how many 9 years old have any idea what is really going on with a tv show more and more that i saw or heard what the teachings of barney were the more and more i told people how bad the show was the funny thing is my parents who had a young child in the mid to late 80's which was me by the way they agreed and said the same thing as i did the sad thing about this is my cousins who are older now 13 and such still agree with what they saw its not cheating its creative its not right to think differently than what someone tells you to its o k to steal if the person wont find out or mind that it is gone lets be honest with ourselves barney is out to make money not teach children anything the more flashy the program the more inclined children will be to watching it children are stupid not because they are not educated they just do not know any better second barney put on a show and parents bought it i never believed that tv could affect people the way barney does if you have a young child read to them watch a show that teaches them numbers do not let them get involved in this show barney is like smoking once is to much smoke a few and your hooked let your kid watch this show they are hooked and one day their kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought
<START> this film was the worst film i have ever seen it was a complete waste of money if i had not been in the cinema was my two young cousins who also thought it was disappointing but not as terrible as i thought i would have left the cinema there were two points in the film that i almost laughed but the rest of it was either boring ridiculous or painful i thought it would be a spoof on all superhero movies which i love but in fact it was mainly based on spiderman with a few oblique references to other superhero movies such as fantastic four and batman i really cannot think of one good thing to say about this film do not waste your money with this film there are many other better films out there
<START> i bought this dvd as part of a set of 50 historic classics it's hardly a classic and as the plot was updated to the time of its release is not historic either the actual title on the dvd is indecent and additionally subtitled the private life of becky sharp myrna loy is not very convincing although in her defense she is saddled with an awful script and trite dialogue as with many early talkies and especially ones made by smaller studios there is little skill demonstrated by the cast and crew loy does wear a few gowns that are quite stylish but her costumes and make up in the later scenes are overdone the one saving grace is a tolerable performance by billy bevan who plays one of her many suitors
<START> i decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on imdb it is cited that john woo a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre american years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest made in us films plans to remake it well here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever the plot of the film is simple and even clichÃ©d by today's standards but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads unique direction by cinematography music and its style there is no way any director today can make such film it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's box office targeted movie business br br john woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from melville's le samourai the killer but remember it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive in salaries but cheap in acting merits actors so what i'm saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made together with another film by melville le samourai watch it and even if the remake will be made try to avoid it before seeing the great original first
<START> renowned czech actor mostly known in north america for his leading role as jacob in the original est german czech production of jacob the liar der 1974 gives us a last brilliant performance as a 80 year old prankster who refuses to admit that he is about to die br br jirÃ­ screenplay is exquisite funny moving and well developed it explores well both the subject of advanced old age and the motivations of characters that are precariously strong and fragile happy and unsettled br br frantisek and his best friend stanislav are up to all types of shenanigans and are making sure to make the best out of their dying days meanwhile wife is preparing for their death saving up for funeral money and chastising frantisek for his endless childishness and irresponsible attitude their son is about to take their apartment over and put them into a retirement home but frantisek doesn't want to hear any of that he wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh he wants to help and love and give but at what cost br br sure to captivate adults of all ages this fine piece of film by talented director vladimÃ­r is both touching and funny it makes you think of how we live our lives and why we live our lives it brings the simple story of a charming stubborn old man to the forefront and allow us to reflect and feel what life is all about br br after an active career lasting more than 40 years it is somewhat sombre to know that died in april 2002 no longer in the grip of terminal cancer it is however uplifting to think that he had the chance to be a part of such a moving script and to be the catalyst of this ode to joyful old age that has not even started to make the waves it is about to create in north american repertoire cinema br br after the international success of jan divided we fall 2000 it is starting to be clear that czech cinema has indeed something to offer to the world this film at least is a must see
<START> a wonderful semi humorous homage to expressionistic black and white films of folks like fw murnau fritz lang carl dreyer marcel carnÃ© and others allen plays a character caught in a kafkaesque nightmare at first thinking he is part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he might be a suspect the writing is a little forced this is after all woody allen trying to be a coy kafka but the point is made and no harm done the cinematography is interesting about 100 shades of gray but make sure you watch in a very dark room with a good screen or details will get swallowed in the fog this is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that are actually snorts of uh huh the acting is fine considering the odd vehicle and it's worth watching if you are big woody allen fan also of interest to those knowledgeable about expressionistic films i'd give this a 6 5 out of 10
<START> there were but two reasons for me to see this film first of all stellan and marisa tomei were in it who are both good actors and i had nothing better to do while seeing the film though i immediately thought of something better to do sleep this film is a complete waste of time it is a standard ex cop flick the ex copper is the best there ever was but he was fired he keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day all big surprises not go to sleep or if you have insomnia try this one br br 4 out of 10
