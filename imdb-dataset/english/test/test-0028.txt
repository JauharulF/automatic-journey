<START> it's a shame really that the script of this film had more holes than you could shake a stick at mixed metaphor intentional because kinski and coyote both supremely talented performers who are capable of great subtlety and nuance have wonderful chemistry together and the always provocative fairuza balk didn't hurt the mix either jeremy piven would have been great here too if his character and all the other supporting characters hadn't been written as a plot device as for the main proceedings the writers just didn't know how to create the suitable guilty or innocent tension for kinski's character instead they gave us confusion contradiction and by the finale downright let's hope the viewers don't notice claptrap
<START> man did this film stink it's obvious this film helped spurn hollywood's need to churn out tired sequels to appeal to the masses first of all it came out too quickly and second of all it just didn't have the same hipness which made the original film so successful no new ground was broken and it turned into a rather mundane effort
<START> well ok i've seen wrath of the ninja br br it isn't something that i would recommend to people who aren't seriously into japanese fighting movies this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot it's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 swords of sorcery i saw the subtitled version not recommended by the way it's easy to miss something and i didn't really keep up with it all it had some good scenes tough but in general it wasn't much to my liking
<START> walking with is a new and exciting programme that uses amazing visual graphics to display the living dinosaurs the information presented here is stunning the moods in the series alter to get your attention things such as dramatic music when fights break out there is clear evidence here for one cracking documentary my greatest thanx to the writers directors and producers and not forgetting the other people involved if you stumble this video in shops i suggest you buy it not just for the graphics but for the extreme efforts and productive work the series has to offer 10 10
<START> that's pretty much all i can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the 1979 carol kane vehicle camilla belle isn't much of an actress and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of jill johnson the babysitter harassed by an anonymous phone caller br br but if you're looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas this movie provides more inspiration than anything you'll see on tlc or jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she's providing her sitting services searching for the origins of strange sounds and things that keep going bump in the night as she lurks around corners and peers down hallways we get to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like roman tubs a huge kitchen with incredible back lit glass shelving and the piece de resistance a self contained and coy pond that feature a self watering system br br because the movie isn't compelling enough to draw us into jill's fear we're distracted by the grandeur of the house which isn't something you should be doing when you're watching a thriller even as jill is pursued by the faceless maniac we cringe because she's breaking valuables and messing up the coy pond not because she's about to get murdered br br the movie plods along as predictably as most teen slasher movies and the ending is anything but original by the time it was over i just wanted to find out where the heck that house was and if it was real never mind jill and the kids she was babysitting br br 2 stars both for the house
<START> after watch this movie i was surprised that someone had like it i think this is the worst comedy i ever seen ever if you think you had already seen the worst comedy made wait for watch this crap not funny at all ok one or two laugh maybe but you have to be really high the acting is terrible and the story doesn't exist even if you like and i really do you will hate this movie ok ok you can see some nice babes some nice tricks and some beautiful mountains but that's all watch a porno set in the mountains instead because the acting and the story line might be better sometimes in imdb i read bad review about some movie and at the end they are not so awful but this one believe me is pure trash don't waste your time and money in this one
<START> as a parent of two girls 14 and 11 i have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at tweens first i am always amazed that the living conditions of drake josh zac cody hanna carly derek sunny etc always make most houses look tiny and cramped most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work paying utility rent mortgage or insurance bills mopping sweeping changing fixing toilets etc just walking in and out and down the ubiquitous wide stairs that only exist on tv sets cracking jokes most of which involve lying and the hilarious results and shirking work i think kids watching these will have unrealistic expectations on how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be second there is never an intact family always a mom or dad but never both who are always going on sexless dates but never seem to have any of the downside of divorce alimony support arguments again kids may get the impression that if mom dad get divorced there will be fun fun fun actually mom or dad are often not around if that helps the plot needless to say there is no mention of spirituality forget specific religion finally there is a theme that troubles me there are nerds that are good in school jocks good in sports goody two shoes as well the protagonists are not good at school sports or charitable but make wisecracks about those who are the message is don't be good at anything just be one of the nothings who blend in cracking jokes needless to say i give all these shows a zero and turn them off all the time and am just short of forbidding them in my house
<START> it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it lord knows i have wanted to after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadn't seen before but wasn't sure why now after reflecting for quite some time i know it's these characters that even now i still can't stop thinking about br br distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative who comes from the to live briefly with a well off to do photographer in the city in hopes to find employment however it becomes clear that after the idea of being a sailor and his employment prospects dim that he's really searching for something else some sort of purpose in his life br br through all this soul searching we are taken through seasonal surroundings that are filmed exquisitely the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other and the look of face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face that scene in itself has to be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces i have witness in i don't know how long br br in the end has his own demons too but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true heartbreak br br what the viewer is left with is lots of reflecting and pondering for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second br br rating 10 out of 10
<START> walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years the script for james walker's sidekick is about as pathetically written of a part as wesley crusher on star trek tng and is played with about as much conviction br br on this show people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life everyone is polarized everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly that's not how life works that's not how people are this show doesn't take place in this reality br br the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her with walker everyone on the show including the bad guys act like he's the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of and time itself bends to his whim the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley crusher for the serious parts and the scriptwriter for bob saget's funniest home videos for the humor parts got together and wrote all the scripts for this show br br this show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil it's for the elderly it's for wishful thinkers it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion it's for people whose drug of choice is their television br br i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years br br i used to like chuck norris but this show has forever tainted him in my mind i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show
<START> wow i suspected this one to be bad but now i find myself just at a loss for words honestly no words of mine can do this movie any justice br br i'll try to say something anyway br br this truly is one unique gem one of the worst kind br br lash la rue given his background as an actor doing a whip fight with a sorcerer zombie during the movie's climax a true stroke of genius without a doubt br br it rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone it happened numerous times with this one br br the accents of the actors man the accents and the dialogues i heard them speak and the acting itself i just couldn't believe what i was hearing br br that fat uncle farting so loudly when walking up to the house together with his little nephew for no apparent reason whatsoever br br tits yes there's titties and female ass there's even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beer br br that one stretch his mouth over his face kill was the bomb a true highlight br br the comedy aspects were just totally bonkers i just couldn't believe what i was seeing and hearing for a while i even thought that they were unintentional shaking my head in disbelief but about halfway in the movie i started to get the bigger picture guess it took me half a movie to dumb down half of my brain to finally get it br br i had a really hard time believing this movie but it's good really i think it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard opening it and then saying look at all the storage space and she said it like she meant it i mean that's good dialogue and good acting right br br oh and perhaps needless to say lash la whip skills suck major ass in the dark power it's really sad and pathetic to behold that's all part of the comedy of course or wait i might be wrong no yes i'm wrong lash la rue was amazing with the whip it was the editor's fault he messed it up cutting his lashes together and all or wait it might have been the camera operator he filmed from the wrong angles then why didn't phil say anything that's it it's the director's fault br br but it's a good movie br br i'm just gonna quit talking about it i have nothing meaningful to say anyway except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience some time soon
<START> all in all big bad john was a hilarious and touching movie if you want romance tragedy and humor this movie's got it if you're a fan of the song like i am you pretty much know how it ends but if you don't or do and want to watch it anyway i strongly recommend this movie jack elam and jimmy dean are a hilarious pair with great chemistry however i wouldn't recommend this movie to strict urban folk you have to understand where these people are supposed to be coming from and only a handful of us are left but even a few urban folk might understand it and appreciate it for what it is a good down home movie that'll make you laugh cry and be inspired
<START> this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message but the message was a clichÃ© hopeless mess to begin with this movie falls on shameless environmental point even making a self righteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planet br br in sitting through this i couldn't help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes her character gets frequent cringe worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit br br far from the brilliance of bruce almighty evan almighty blows its whole record breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evan's ark but by the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark flood and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god yes god was trying to influence politics
<START> i saw this movie and i do like horror movies br br i did not know what to expect but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it the idea was pretty original and the acting was nice especially jenna dewan as the exciting evil tamara br br the hardest thing about horror movies is to make a good ending but there the movie failed for a change a end scene in a hospital where suddenly all employees are gone first you see doctors and nurses running around but then they all went home br br no cries for help while being chased by tamara escaping to the roof also a smart move not and off course a kind of open ending br br no the movie started great the main part was nice to watch but they really messed up the ending using all clichÃ©s from bad horror movies jeffrey failed in my eyes with this movie after making some really quality movies like final destination 1 and 2 br br if you like a good horror full of clichÃ© endings tamara is a good movie to watch for me i like movies which surprise me
<START> along with his turn in the super sleazy 'classic' the toolbox murders 1978 this is considered the ultimate bad cameron mitchell horror effort it's a little too slow moving for my tastes has zero likable characters in it and not much action until the very end but mitchell's dedicated central psycho performance as vengeance minded whack job vincent is fun not anthony perkins good mind you but definitely fun enough as a spoof of the shallow conceit that is hollywood it's only so so as a horror movie it's also only fair and even as just a simple vintage exploitation picture it's just ok i'm a big fan of the unnecessary gratuitous dance sequence so i was also thankful for the appearance of the dancers who just rule five of them do a crazy hair floor hip shaking' go go dance routine to don't cry look for the rainbow by the t bones watching these ladies bounce around with huge smiles on their faces in their fringe covered bikini top and parachute pants ensemble is a defining reason why i give this a slightly higher rating that usual br br former movie make up man vincent the best since lon chaney goes after people at paragon studios a flashback shows how max black berry a jealous and drunk studio executive flung wine in face right when he was about to light a smoke he's engulfed in flames and dives into a pool but not before scarring up one side of his face and losing an eyeball not to mention his sanity now employed by the world famous wax museum in buena park california vincent uses a special serum described as a mixture of truth serum nerve medicine and special vitamins and minerals watch out to paralyze victims they disappear and the dense detectives on the case headed by scott brady act baffled as new are put on display in the museum vince talks to himself i'm a terribly nice man chain smokes mumbles hisses and describes how he gets excited by the sound of a woman's scream br br he also has to deal with a bunch of back stabbing scumbags and self absorbed witches most of whom will deserve what's coming to them there is also nick hollis morrison a boozy inept museum tour guide who sees a blink but doesn't go to the cops aside from max a real grade a jerk who doesn't even die and the stupid cops the other two lead roles are women and both are pretty atrocious marie morgan anne helm is not your typical innocent heroine this tramp has been engaged to no less that five different characters in this movie including vince max and two of the wax dummies missing male stars i guess she never had time to make a go at the one missing girl for some reason she also begs and pleads in her irritating baby voice for vince to give her a of the head he's designing of the newest missing actor and fiancÃ© number 5 tony deen phillip she doesn't know that vince has already jabbed a syringe in the back of his neck but i love it when mitchell dryly agrees with her demands so you can completely retreat for reality he also wants her to for him which means she's eventually held prisoner in a box unfortunately the box has a hole where her head sticks through so we have to continue getting aurally assaulted by her high pitched whines br br the other woman is theresa victoria carroll one of the aforementioned go go girls she's first seen proving she is thoroughly rhythm deficient by jiggling on stage in a lime green fringe bikini theresa is tolerable before she talks but when you realize her grating presence combines the of lorraine bracco with the airhead mentality of the landers sisters you wish vincent would inject her with the serum as soon as possible unfortunately we're first subjected to a scene of her making endless demands to the studio head honcho and running around in the museum trying to avoid mitchell she and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic but function as a way to poke fun at the hollywood system in general i guess and i'm probably giving this movie more credit than it actually deserves the pluses are few and far between but include other than mitchell and the dance routine colorful slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell married to marie yikes now that is scary br br also in the cast are director john bud cardos also the production manager as a police sergeant james forrest as a film director virgil frye as a statue martin and kent osborne as a bartender many of the people who worked on this one including executive producer and script writer rex carlton also worked on the al adamson movie blood of dracula's castle and other atrocities br br my score 4 out of 10
<START> screened this morning for the press at roma film festival n e is easy to love first of all it can count on great production values as very few italian films nowadays can with wonderful settings and costumes the cast is great too director constantly speaks of the young lead elio as a young de niro now of course he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act i loved his performance and he did a great job with the tuscan accent daniel auteuil is a great actor and did very well as bonaparte it's really great to see him acting in italian i hope to see him working in italy again very soon the supporting cast worked well too people like or sabrina may seem unlikely choices but they all gave fine performances even massimo best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny the low point of the cast was the diva monica bellucci sure she was slightly better than usual but she managed to look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of emilia in which with a good dose of self irony she used her own accent the script by veteran and himself is clever with lots of laugh out loud lines and a few very emotional moments too sure the ending left me puzzled the message is kind of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly it's difficult to hate him then in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning personally i dislike very much this notion e is still a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so far the other being fur and the hoax my rating is 8 10
