<START> recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film by director mani at the 2002 toronto international film festival i have bestowed my highest honour of the film festival on this feature make sure that you do not let an opportunity to experience this cinematic gem pass you by but be this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as homo a 10
<START> the premise of this movie of a comedian talk show host running for president as an independent just to shake things up is funny entertaining brilliant and even a bit inspiring thought about the west wing debate when tom dobbs leaves his podium thought about steven colbert announcing his candidacy good times the first 15 20 minutes of this movie are therefore very very entertaining the debate especially when he eventually get's elected it's a pity that is because of a computer glitch you'd want him to win fair although that is unrealistic br br but after that this movie goes completely downhill i thought we'd get a great movie like 1993 in which we see how it would out if a comedian actually ran the country instead the movie turns from comedy into a thriller a romantic comedy and a drama and does none good the computer glitch becomes the main storyline which really sucks boy is this disappointing i give it 3 stars just for the premise and because i actually managed to watch this movie from start to end without stopping it which is usually a good thing with me
<START> the films' producers are hoping that cameron name will help sell this picture unfortunately nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen despite some beautifully shot european locations and some solid production design elements the film fails mostly due to its awkward unbelievable romance between brewster and eccleston an filmgoing experience
<START> how does this movie suck as a fan of michael work on the sopranos i picked this up at blockbuster based on his name and a story that sounded like it had promise it still does but this movie doesn't fulfill it br br every turn of the story is entirely predictable i kept looking for the lifetime bug on the bottom right corner of the screen it's all there the noble woman coming out of hard times the guy failing to live up to his potential despite her best efforts the kid who gets stuck in the middle etc etc etc the mysterious stranger's identity is what really made me want to throw stuff at the tv i would have been more satisfied with little waking up and realizing it was all a dream br br the filmmakers may as well have had a the moral of the story is bit before the credits since as another reviewer pointed out this thing really does roll like an afterschool special don't gamble don't drink don't do drugs stay with your wife spend time with your kids come on how about a little nuance how about some interesting bad guys writer director a w should be singled out for special notice not only is the dialogue leaden the pacing within dialogue and at either end of many scenes makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it needs to be and believe me it feels like longer the talents of imperioli renee and some of the supporting cast steve schirripa natch are the only things that keep this from a 1 rating all of their good work is nearly offset though by the atrocious job of portraying the boy not sure if it was a casting mistake hey it's a mob movie so let's cast someone from blue's clues who can't do anything but over overact with a big fake grin next let's cast the sullen brooding kid in the disney flick or just awful directing but those scenes are really painful to watch br br i'd be interested in another filmmaker's take on this character and his story it's a shame imperioli has already been used up by this flick awful awful awful
<START> i saw bogard when it was released in the 70s it was one of those pictures that received an x rating for violence we snuck into our local grindhouse and saw it anyway pretty good picture lots of blood from the street fights although the cheap sound effects for the punches took something away from it and lots of sex i remember one of the early scenes when bogard meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she is showing him without saying a word he picks her up puts her in the and nails her from what i remember the picture sailed from that point on so when i found out bogart is also called black fist and was available on vhs i ordered it online i was very disappointed black fist is bogard edited for television so many of the scenes i remember were missing i wondered if indeed this was the same picture
<START> while the camerawork was certainly funky perhaps one dutch roll short of stoned the premise of the film was fantastic it really took a scathingly satirical in the true traditional of hal hartley look at god jesus and devil the interaction of jesus and satan provides some hilarious scenes even the monologues of jesus were great this was by far the best jesus i've even seen so zen like son of god ish but still such a nice guy on one level this is a very general look on the paradoxes of christianity but yet there is still a personal level where you can relate to jesus christ without having a god complex thanx to martin donovan and hal hartley
<START> i read the above comment and cannot believe it of course its a children's movie its an adaptation of a children's book this film is easy to get a hold of try play com or amazon and its very easy to gain a copy the jokes are hilarious for kids and adults alike and the adventure is clean with no violence its completely suitable for children of all ages the songs are fab and yes a little repetitive but thats what children need and whilst watching it my little ones were heard singing hi hi all night they loved it a story of innocence and friendship very lovely and well worth watching for kids and adults of all ages
<START> if you first saw this movie with mary of the fourth form then it's perhaps possible for the haze of nostalgia to encourage your charitable side if not it doesn't stand a chance the young things' is complete nonsense people may have used the occasional word you'll hear here but not huge of them in sentence after sentence it doesn't so much date dracula ad 1972 as blow it to pieces from the moment anyone under thirty opens their mouth it's impossible to take the film seriously and as for it being a laugh it's not even a smile the idea of throwing dracula into modern times is a good one and worthy of a far stronger script than don houghton can provide the river thames and chelsea male are no match for puppet bats model castles and terrified extras but you can't help but feel that with better writing it would have been so different
<START> i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great it's an adult entertainment full of issues that a grown person can relate to the acting is superb it's fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a feuding middle aged couple who knows how much of it came from their own marriage susan sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character aretha raul julia is a hoot as a lusty the scenery in greece is spectacular the new york settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the world trade center fantastic score by with so many things going for it why isn't this a great film it's a bit rambling and overly long unfocused and uncomfortably imbalanced between humor and drama still it's engaging entertaining and deeply thoughtful
<START> by far the most racist and cartoon for children 7 kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress talk and act like the characters portrayed i am disappointed in nickelodeon and nick jr for agreeing to air this terrible program the wayan's brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers they should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon usually the young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice overs for cartoons and then as they grow older they move up to programs for young adults a good example is nick cannon he first started out with appearing in all that later on he starred in mib ii then drumline and now his tv show nick cannon presents wild 'n out where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes this comment was originally for but i wanted to show examples of how celebs kids watched on tv not long ago can become those who get involved with non kid friendly programs it is very sad that this happens but all celebs change and grow up it is just the opposite with the wayan's brothers new cartoon it is bad enough we have to deal with all the bad people from the ghettos with allowing the young generation watch this program it will just convert the kids with possibilities to the ones who don't have a chance at a good life just my feelings on this cartoon and my beliefs on what will happen to our children if they were to watch it
<START> when i first heard about this movie i noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s i noticed the music was by elton john so i figured i had nothing to loose so i got it what a surprise the movie was awesome it was true love is all about the characters paul and michelle had no luxuries no money and sometimes no food yet they were still happy i recommended this film to all my friends but they all my tastes and even called me names becuase the movie featured two minors naked i think that only made the movie more realistic the cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director lewis gilbert
<START> i really didn't like this film it was boring and didn't interest me that much at all i'm more of an action girl and it had none i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left but was totally mislead don't get this movie unless you like the dessert and plenty of boredom i just really didn't like the movie it wasn't my style but it could be yours you would just have to watch the previews or something but it's my recommendation if you're a girl don't get this movie this scandinavian production draws on some of the observational strategies of godfrey koyaanisqatsi allowing us to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping viewpoints this just isn't for me
<START> don't believe the hype br br i had to see why all the critics fawn over this movie i have seen it and still don't get it the plot is thin very thin after the movie was over i still did not know the female lead characters name and one of the two male characters did not even have a name in the credits he is credited as the farmer i did not care about the characters so i did not care about the movie br br the scenery and cinematography were brilliant but so is the stuff on national geographic or the discovery channel br br i can not recommend this movie to anyone
<START> i was very concerned about this film it was scheduled to play at a jewish film festival and was reported to be very hostile to israel while using clever humor and irony br br i was relieved that the film was not a diatribe however as a work of film it was deeply disappointing the film was full of random events some of which eventually connected most of which did not some of the events were very clever and funny but some were merely random and pointless br br there are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car and play some game perhaps in some cultures this is erotic but it's like watching thumb wrestling after the third time it really became tiresome br br i have always found david lynch to be gratuitously bizarre using strange stories and images to cause audiences to think that he is so sophisticated that they don't grasp his work in fact there is nothing to grasp the same is true here the stories do not add up to anything and there is not much of a political point being made in one scene a boisterous israeli soldier humiliates palestinian drivers at a checkpoint that's news br br i don't understand why this film has garnered controversy nor why it has garnered attention it is an inferior work and seeing it was a waste of time
<START> and 1 2 stars out of lifeforce is one of the strangest films i've ever seen so ridiculous yet at the time it's strangely compelling and never the least bit dull whether it's due to the nonstop nudity the large amount of violence and action it all comes together to make an entertaining 2 hours of cinema br br the churchill has been sent to investigate halley's comet when they detect something hiding inside the coma of the giant rock a small team led by colonel steve railsback has been sent to search the area what they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat like creatures and three nude and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers two male and one female mathilda may they decide to take all three back with them which results in a catastrophe br br when london receives no response from the crew another crew is sent to find out what's going on when they dock with the churchill they find the remains of the crew all dessicated beyond recognition the humanoids are still in perfect condition and they take them back to london br br after various tests the scientists still don't know what these beings really are then late one night a security guard in the compound feels compelled to enter the room the female is being held he touches her shoulder and she awakens stands up and smiles at him in a seductive and wicked manner she approaches him and begins to kiss him when it becomes clear that she's actually taking his lifeforce sucking him of all of his energy the effect is slightly cheesy br br she escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail behind another man colonel caine peter firth is brought in to track her down then the men discover that there is a pattern to the lifeforce process the corpse of the security guard awakens in 2 hours and takes the lifeforce of a doctor it seems in every 2 hours this process is repeated by a victim with the help of the churchill's sole survivor they attempt to track the girl down before it's too late br br lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment it has all the elements one could look for in such a movie loads of nudity blood gore and plenty of special effects this is certainly better than a similarly plotted film species thanks in large part to a more riveting finale br br the performances range from decent to terrible faring the worst is easily steve railsback who overacts to no end much better are peter firth who comes through and convincingly and the gorgeous mathilda may she's as beautiful as french actresses sophie and emmanuelle seigner may does go through virtually the whole role without wearing clothing and there were reports that it was hard on her while filming so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive there are times when she can be quite creepy being simply seductive most of the film manages to work because of her br br
