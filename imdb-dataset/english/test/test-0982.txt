<START> this film is wonderful example of the quality dramas that channel 4 and the bbc have produced over the years ted danson delivers a powerful performance of a man tormented by memories noone will accept and a society that believes he is insane it is a remarkable performance by a man most known for his role in cheers a tv comedy sitcom the supporting cast are all very well chosen not least mary wife who acts the part of gulliver's wife in the film but above all it is the seamless and very delicate shifts between our world and gulliver's world that make this film the difference in perspective between giants and midgets all acted by real actors is beautifully captured a rare treat of cinematography and direction
<START> as a serious horror fan i get that certain marketing ploys are used to sell movies especially the really bad ones so i wouldn't call it naivetÃ© that i assumed this was softcore horror ripping off cannibal zombi jungle holocaust unfortunately i was completely wrong as this is very hardcore i should have realized that when i saw the odd no actual or identifiable minor was used warning notice the identifiable part as though he is daring us to catch him a group of scientists half of whom are pretty women in bikinis are led by a sea captain with a penchant for on the beach in search for a mutated native killing villagers due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a supposedly evacuated island the radiation turned this last man into a rapist killer br br writer actor george eastman is the only one trying here and succeeds in keeping his clothes on the sex scenes are whacked out women walk around nude exuding a strange overconfidence and one even asks for rape when her husband turns her down well two chicks slapping each other naturally turns into a lesbo scene because women are i saw the chick toss another chicks salad and finger herself br br if there is anything you should know about this film it is that because the rest of this insane movie is just the same oh who am i kidding there is a ton more to tell here like the white duchess that pays for 2 black guys to tag team her in a parlor or the duchess taking off her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself when he refuses her advances she starts crying so being the good gentleman he is he reluctantly lets her pleasure him in front of the other crew members i was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the duchess to ask if there is any other way to pay him br br and all of this happens before they depart for the island to conduct their research wait i thought this was a zombie flick but the zombie doesn't enter until the mark but by that time everyone else has been entered plenty i found myself hitting fast forward a few several this is my first splatter porn flick and i don't think it does that subgenre any justice i guess it is the woman in me talking when i say that i would like more plot and less sweaty slobbering hairy sex funny thing is this could have worked as a decent horror film as the idea of atomic bombing mutating a bitter man and killing his family was a good one even eastman's character shakes his head and walks away from a couple copulating it makes me wonder if it was the character or the writer himself that was disgusted br br i don't feel like going into the sound or film quality because you should have already guessed it was bad this production was shot back to back with 3 other movies including erotic nights of the living dead which sports most of the same cast eastman has said this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a paycheck nevermind i feel like talking about the sound suddenly the sound was weird during the sex scenes because while the cast is speaking italian it seems as though they recorded english voiceovers and played that over their dialogue so while 2 people are boning i can clearly hear someone in the background say no yes wonderful wait there was a slightly amusing italian score that couldn't save this movie the sfx were minimal at best and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes and i would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes as the bright warning label said on the dvd cover ahem another marketing ploy so no fear there only fear the bad movie br br presented in widescreen 1 85 1 aspect ratio i watched the region 1 not rated version running at released in 2005 by exploitation digital there is apparently a xxx version by digital which is the same running time so i doubt anything is different prices vary but you shouldn't pay more than 25 00 for a copy or as i would recommend pay nothing and pretend it doesn't exist br br favorite quote shipmate civilians are bad luck women are bad luck they're scientists too they must really be monsters dvd extras original trailer with hardcore shots kills to make it look more interesting than it is trailers for ss hell camp emmanuelle and a very informative interview with eastman br br bottom line lame porno but even weaker as a horror film either get real porn or watch real horror br br rating 3 10 by molly celaschi www horroryearbook com
<START> captain mandolin is no oscar contender but it was pretty good i have to admit ms cruz can really act she puts on a very good performance in fact she our does her boyfriend tom in drama john hurt was great as usual nicholas cage seemed to be enjoying himself i bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an italian however i did learn something one more chapter in horrors of nazi germany the many italian killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and germany's eventual surrender
<START> i came across this film by accident and wish i hadn't br br why make a sexually rude sequel and some gore when a man is beheaded of a well know children's movie br br do not take young kids to see this the title misdirects you it has nothing to do with the original snow white except for stealing it's characters better still don't bother going yourself it's not worth it br br i could not watch it all the poor in comparison to disney cartoon graphics and no plot except on how to totally mess up a classic movie made me want to give up and leave
<START> this movie is retarded a cheap movie that tries to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for pot but none of them are smokers just a bunch of garbage thomas hayden church should not direct anymore especially this movie which is a waste of film people who liked this movie gave good comments but from all the people on here some are just retarded and don't watch movies so they think that any bad movie is good the actors suck and the movie sucks balls br br i think that many people are going to be upset because this movie tries to make itself look like the ultimate weed movie when it is just the worst movie about weed that i have ever seen i hope that people will stop the director from directing crap like this even weed cannot make this movie funny or entertaining
<START> i'll never understand why when a studio like universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen my first thought when seeing ava gardner and robert walker were starring i would be seeing something from mgm which did musicals best at that time boy was i wrong and disappointed br br one touch of venus which starred mary martin kenny baker and john boles on broadway ran for performances in the 1943 1945 season and gardner walker and tom conway play the roles that martin baker and boles did on stage the kurt weill ogden nash musical with book by nash and s j was a comeback vehicle for mary martin who herself as the queen of broadway after a disappointing venture in hollywood br br look at the names that went into this show given who was responsible for the book i expected to see some sparkling wit in this production instead i got a rather pedestrian screenplay it was like all the wit was drained out of it doing her best to make up for it is eve arden playing her usual girl friday role with tom conway but it's even too much for eve br br the story concerns department store window dresser robert walker who kisses a very valuable statue of venus who springs to life in the person of ava gardner of course when the statue goes missing conway yells for the law and is suspicious of walker the last person to be with the statue br br the rest of the film is walker dealing with gardner and what will happen to both of them for reasons i don't understand ava was of course dubbed by eileen wilson and walker sings only a couple of lines the singing is carried by dick and olga san juan playing walker's friends and coworkers of course on broadway the songs were done by singers mary martin and kenny baker you would kind of think that would be playing walker's role at least it was awkward to say the least br br only three songs survived from the score don't look now but my heart is showing that's him and the incomparable speak low silken baritone is shown to best advantage in speak low which was sung as a duet by martin and baker on broadway for some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of verse of the last century ogden nash were done over by ann i suspect the infamous code was at work here br br in lee biography of ava gardner he makes mention of a brief fling ava had with robert walker when she had had a spat with her current man howard duff when duff and gardner reunited walker took it badly and didn't speak at all to gardner off camera i'm sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn't help matters either br br hopefully some repertoire company will do one touch of venus and you'll get to see it the way weill nash and wrote it
<START> this is probably the worst movie i've seen in a long time independent or not solid writing is a must ditto for directing and acting i know these actors can act i've seen them in and more but this movie is very bad very bad maybe it's the script maybe it's the director probably a little of both probably a lot of both technically ok just bad bad bad i have a theory that the backers for this movie also own the poker magazines because i saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines hey' we made it so it's gotta be good right not so fast i know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made much less sold and distributed and for that i commend these folks but the final product leave a bad taste in my mouth br br p s i won a free rental and chose this movie from blockbuster tomorrow i'm going to get my money back
<START> this movie should have ended as soon as the joke about kids is told in the opening i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see liken it to taking the point of one of jerry seinfeld's jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie this movie had to be self serving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value 1 10 stars because there is no half star
<START> a true masterpiece by and tony demonstrates his exceptional acting ability as the cool enigmatic br br yet another example of a must see movie that the everyday person will not receive access as the high street cinema chains are full of hollywood funded nonsense fortunately i reside in the metropolis and amongst the privileged few who enjoy the choice the art house cinema provides i champion the day when cinema investment will be into film screenings allowing choice for the masses and away from assembling penny sweet counters br br film of the year for me so far and yes i've seen a few
<START> i don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while i did i got so engrossed i gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted and i sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show but i was crying at the end a lot of emotional nuance great acting and good southern feel john corbett is one of the most talented actors out there and the guy who played luke was really good too highly recommend
<START> it's been said that batman begins in the first batman movie to get it right but i think that's a horrible overstatement for i think the new batman film although greater that batman forever and batman and robin pales compared to tim burton's classics with this one being the best of the five the darkness is beautiful as is the music and scenery creating a gotham city cloaked in mystery unlike batman begins where gotham city is a normal looking city the villains are terrific in this movie you literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman i applaud tim burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old batman tv show in batman begins we have the scarecrow whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman the film doesn't need to focus only on batman because we already know his story and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out and they are the ones who create the plot with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents' desertion by killing the first born sons of gotham a task he fails danny devito gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film surpassing even nicholson's joker the closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful it's a tragedy that tim burton wasn't allowed to complete his trilogy since warner bros interesting in marketing appeal wanted to lighten the batman movies up and they got their wish unfortunately tim burton planned on directing the third film using the riddler as the villain with no two face and robin to mess it up and i'm sure michael keaton would've signed on so this is the last great batman film batman begins is dark but boring tedious ordinary filled with lackluster villains and a playboy bruce wayne a decent batman film but the best batman film ever never batman returns holds that crown
<START> a by the numbers exorcism exercise with a disappointing non allegiance and usage of the term ' the cinematography appears right out of basic cable mow land which removes any semblance of swampy murky atmosphere from the proceedings in addition there's not nearly enough gore sex or attractive young things to satiate the majority of the film's targeted viewers that being said the lead actress who plays the possessed has a sexy olive skinned presence what else needs to be said about this non winner don't rent unless you've got a thing for middle aged adults bemoaning their past and rants with clichÃ©d priests shrinks hispanic all regretting their past actions
<START> one of the best ever direction a thrilling and dramatic history wonderful soundtrack and most of all the incredible credibility of susan sarandon and sean penn the best and most underestimated under 40 generation actor after seeing this movie i guess if there's anyone who couldn't have any doubt about giving death to another man in spite of the ugly things he could have done
<START> this film must have been quietly released on some other side of the world perhaps even in english hopefully nobody understood a word not there's anything to understand in this movie anyways call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever why would i come to that conclusion because it's my national to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute once i became a fan of science theater 3000 i had no doubt in my mind they'd find it somewhere and use it sure enough the version they acquired was entitled cave dwellers using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself apparently they were ashamed to use footage from their own film i can't say i recommend buying this film rather i highly recommend getting the mst3k version sure to find it most anywhere mst3k dvd's are sold don't miss out
<START> i'm not sure how i can make ten lines out of this question but i'll try br br when julie went to the dance and they were dancing to slow music what was the name of the song that was playing and who played it br br i love that song and i watch the movie over and over just to hear that one song br br i did several searches online and even looked up the soundtrack but i sill can't find the song br br it might be because the song they were dancing to wasn't a complete song and just partial br br i would appreciate if anyone out there who knows what the name of the song and the group who sung it br br thank you br br frank
