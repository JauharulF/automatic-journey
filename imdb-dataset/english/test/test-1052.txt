<START> although unusually in colour for a second string oater the vivid clothes of the lead females fails to bring any life to the flatly directed screenplay the plot revolves around the youngers newly released on parole attempting to go straight but being pursued by a vengeful ex pinkerton man a scenery chewing fred clark and a femme fatale determined to involve them in her bank robbery schemes whether they want to or not as cole younger wayne morris is big and hunky enough but his cool demeanour and wooden acting skills undermine things the standard of action is frankly no better than a gene autry or roy rogers tv episode with colt that never need reloading and uncanny shooting skills that allow a horse rider to shoot from the hip and wound a man from at least 50 feet oh dear
<START> i watched this film in the theater in along with 3 other americans and our friend from manchester and we all thought this was a waste of time we would have much rather spent an extra hour to watch vapid dialog of star wars iii that was playing down the hall than all of this br br opening with one of the worst jokes i've ever seen committed to celluloid on the big screen it did not take off with a bang throughout the movie we got the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard the writers thought about the setup so much that you could see the joke coming 2 minutes beforehand then when it came it was so lackluster that you couldn't even smile i cite the giraffe cum ming as a prime example br br the plot itself makes for some interesting thoughts in my mind which entertained me much more than what was going on on the screen i think a lot more could have been done with that angle the two different worlds the fish out of water experience of the characters the confusion and surprise as people try to comprehend and distinguish the characters and writers from each other but too much time is wasted with pushing this painful plot to the end with as much and 'goof' as is humanly possible br br and to say the 16th century characters show any extra talent from the writers is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who possibly could have made this film a worthy 40 minute afterthought but no its a full length torture film of unfunniness br br as we were leaving the theater which had very little laughing inside it i overheard the young hip electro clash british couple behind me saying that was rather good wasn't it you never really knew what was coming next and the girl responding yeah quite surprising and that was it if this is what is meant to get out of british people from watching a comedy no laughing for 90 minutes but a teeny bit of communication between two lovers at the end then this film succeeded but i have more belief in british life than that br br i've not not laughed so hard at a comedy film since american pie ii
<START> when i was 10 currently 14 i vowed to never see a movie that i knew would not have a happy ending and until a few weeks ago i had done pretty well except for shakespere for english class etc i was still only watching things that ended happy but then i saw garai in nights which was cute not good but entertaining enough to watch after seeing this a few times over the two or so years since i first saw it i grew to like it especially the music so i did a search on her and found imdb i saw inside i'm dancing and assumed she had done another dancing movie and over looked it it was later on an image search of rory looking for gilmore girls poster for locker i picked up an image from this movie i then searched for a trailer i found the trailer and when i saw the hospital and heard rory say you've got the future i remembered my vow and realized this would not be a good movie for me but it just stayed in the back of my mind until we were at the video store and there it was for 5 used so i went ahead and bought it after seeing it i just wanted it out of my head because it was so sad i still wouldn't go near it until i had cerebral palsy as a word then i just had to see it again and this time all i did was laugh even at the saddest parts i no longer felt depressed because i realized that over all this movie was happy and uplifting i love it and it is now one of my favorites i m sure this is the worst comment you have ever read but watch the movie it's worth it
<START> i enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time i saw it when i was 9 is kind of cute for kiddies in a corny way it reminded me of on sat mornings its swedish backdrops make it easy on the eyes don't expect older kids to be interested as the live action animation is way behind the times and most older kids will get bored this is definitely an under 10 age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in 1974
<START> i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from right out of the air the horror the horror br br as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end i didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots i love them now for the unintentional humor br br but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well worn formula there are no rules
<START> first of all i do not look down on americans i know lots of people that are intelligent people from the usa but this movie is so utterly bad that i just had to comment on it br br first of all movies are mostly far from the truth this movie is no exception lots of scene's are so incredibly false for example the departure of the 2 space ships you see them drop off the full tanks in space just a small distance from each other remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past just a part that came off in here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship what idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time second of it is that the russian station is a piece of s crap i hate to bring this up to you but astronauts nowadays go to russia since their equipment is much more reliable then the space shuttle is retired and nasa uses it just to pay off the bills and there is no better alternative for it and the list of whoppers goes on and on this is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious and i know half as much as these guys do but the most annoying part read the whole movie is the propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with my god i thought i was looking at a cnn business commercial for like an hour the actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with start up fights ignore the police etc etc but when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it bomb detonator maybe i lack the feeling of being a true patriot that can sing the national anthem backwards in swahili whilst riding with george bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart driving in circles until the battery is empty but this movie was too much for me too handle and when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the american flag out of my i realised that i was glad this movie was finally done i do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded stereotyping propaganda movie but i pity them this represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power as long as uncle sam thinks you are a good patriot where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated no one cares
<START> sister helen is a superb documentary about a rigid intolerant foul mouthed bitter civilian nun who runs a shelter for drunks and in a very rundown neighborhood in the south bronx all but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunks addicts robert the only middle class representative Â he had a real job house and even a bmw Â regrets she died before he could tell her off why br br robert like six of the residents was on parole he complained that helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didn't cow tow to her in an extras interview he said helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life Â her husband and her two boys br br the husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55 one boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15 helen was left with one daughter who she abandoned to run the center the daughter was not pleased she wanted her mom br br what's fascinating is how little helen changed outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change but after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times once with the directors narrating it became clear that helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males br br helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars but her intolerance and sharp tongue didn't emerge at age 56 living with her must have been extremely difficult even robert says he stayed clean in spite of helen br br the film opens with helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter supposedly she is showing off her street savvy another time she publicly demeans mel her assistant for not bathing for a year then she waves his filthy in the air the film is viscous with helen threatening and demeaning people her signature song is my way her favorite phrase is i'm going to be totally honest with you often people who use such phrases turn out o be the opposite br br the residents are really down and out only robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom they all desperately need a roof over their heads and helen since she runs the place on her own has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases she has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding it is her show br br helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety she stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too she blames substance abuse on the drug or booze and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug she's no therapist just a landlady who dyes her hair wears a habit and wields complete power over her tenants and stopped drinking br br helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine she calls it tests on requests twice major a very solid and respected long term older resident who she trusted failed his tests helen was furious and evicted him major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin helen didn't yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made this was especially troubling since she knew major for a long time yet she discounted her relationship with him assumed he was a liar and relied completely on the results major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate helen never apologized publicly but supposedly made up with major privately br br helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood she tacitly admitted to robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someone's tires the person wronged her and certainly deserved to have his her tires slashed she was not a nice woman so eventually she decided the only way to keep the travis name her last name alive Â since the three male died Â was to start the travis center br br for some of the residents it was a great deal they complied with helen and in exchange received a cheap safe sober and structured place to live one however said he preferred jail addicts and drunks don't all need to be treated like children helen employed old school techniques which have been discredited however no one was forced to remain at the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience the travis center is not a treatment center it is a residence for alcoholics and who what to straighten out their lives br br to receive the full sister helen experience see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with sister helen and her guests
<START> i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts and to be honest i didn't know how much i would like it i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised driving lessons is a modest simple film which draws you in right from the start rupert plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly he's definitely one to look out for in the future dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity the highlight of the film for me was rather colourful poem it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs in my opinion watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours the scenery was also striking especially the countryside anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable i strongly disagree with
<START> famous as the british film so bad it had to be given away for free with a newspaper the quality of this sub children's film foundation thriller can be guessed from the abnormal number of 10 10 votes it gets and the large number of rave reviews from posters with no posting history and no other reviews to their name the regulars know what this mean the gullible might be conned if they do dip into the waters of this one they won't last long before it drags them under technically inept with the boom mike getting into shot or the reflections of the crew visible it just goes on forever in a forgetful sub davinci code on 5 a day way the end is just insulting but don't worry it's not as if you'll get that far
<START> being a bills fan i originally found it annoying that they made a movie about the bills and the losing of four but once i began to watch i felt really connected it was actually nice to see the bills win the superbowl and i must say that for a tv movie it was actually very well done gil bellows as the and jon voight as the old school coach did a very fine job 8 out of 10
<START> this entry doesn't contain a spoiler it doesn't have to the movie is as predictable as the sunrise the element in the first alien movies was the suspense that something could happen this was so in the first two predator movies though less prevalent requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore you know people are going to die well duh it is a movie but you know who is going to die and when they are going to die and where they are going to die before it happens the directors should take a lesson from hitchcock who said suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table suspense is a bomb not going off under the table what's the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when if you really really want to watch this movie wait until it comes out on video and then rent it but by no means would i ever buy it
<START> a bad movie but with one reel that is worth savoring for most of the film the jokes are bad the songs are bad even w c fields is bad then there is one sequence with bob hope and his movie ex the dialogue is witty and the song a version of thanks for the memories light cynical and delightful who in for this one bit yet it makes the whole thing worth the original 25 cents admission
<START> quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in forming the language of film if you are interested in film history to truly understand the innovations eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing potemkin along side most any film made before it those of d w griffith offer a good contrast it should be allowed that eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time however even today few directors have approached the skill with which eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium br br if you are not interested in that sort of thing potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made you should see it buy it and it to your chest
<START> maybe i'm alone here but this is a crap show i'm sorry but i was lured in when i found out about lil' bill o'reilly which i had no idea came from this show until months later and has honestly since lost its appeal but i gave the show a fair shot spike tries to hard to make himself into something he's not which is to say he tries to be human fox didn't even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he came in his sketches try to hard he himself isn't funny and the writers are struggling to write material for a no talent host there is too much good tv out there to waste your time with this show and fox fox we had some good times but you need to get your f ing act together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another me too network
<START> when i saw this movie for the first time i didn't believe my own eyes in front of me there was a great and well done parody of valentino see stan laurel bullfight that way is like to see an excellent fencer in action it's a very good parody rich of ideas with a clever and charming stan old and good like whiskey or the booze up after that
