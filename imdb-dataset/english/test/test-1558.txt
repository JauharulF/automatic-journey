<START> i thought i could see something good but i am tired after seeing this movie i don't know what i hated the most the script the acting the fx or the music try to picture the worst power rangers episode and would still be to kind i've seen better fx in fps games the touch with the bone sword or his breath that is making the people disappear in a green smoke is touch of genius and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western i did liked how the women in the car was screaming when the monster was walking around the car even if she's looking in the wrong way so give your self a break and don't watch this thing at least call somebody up to see a horror movie with you trust me you will end up playing monopoly for some kicks
<START> this was intolerable spoiler 1 protagonists avoid the pointless disclosure of agonizing truths to their loved ones lest they surrender said status and assume the roles of antagonists spoiler 2 the writers would have us believe that the exposure of multiple transgressions by the presents a threat to and provokes a response by the primary victim of the transgressions spoiler 3 until the final 15 minutes i was anticipating a score of 6 to 8 out of 10 instead it was kind of like discovering that lieutenant columbo's dog is the real murderer the story just wasn't credible and i don't think the world's best director could have saved it without massive editing
<START> the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56 but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuve's appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and x comes across as a student's imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
<START> if at all possible try to view all five of the universal mummy films in order not so much for the continuity between films but for the very evident lack thereof of course it goes without saying that the original boris karloff classic the mummy really shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as the so called sequels all of which come off as campy or cultish br br this time around it's revealed that the mummified remains of princess ananka have made their way to the united states and once again as your eyes deceive you kharis the mummy didn't really die for the second time in the mummy's tomb but is alive and searching for his lost love princess ananka with the help of the rhetorical nine tana leaves during the cycle of the full moon to complete the mythology kharis needs a caretaker ably filled by a gaunt john carradine as yousef bey entrusted with the task by george andoheb high priest of arkan br br kharis and ananka are to be returned to their final resting place in the hills of arkan in egypt but as we've seen before being entrusted with the duty of a high priest is a sure bet to end in failure with carradine's character falling for the reincarnation of ananka ramsay ames it's shocking to see yousef bey and the bandaged one come to blows over the gorgeous br br riddle me this in both tomb and curse lon chaney portrays the mummy with a limp right arm folded helplessly across his chest when he encounters the fainted he lifts her up in both arms with no problem as soon as he puts her down his right arm returns to it's crippled position once again br br the ending of the film is most notable the monster gets the girl but it's a short lived victory as the mummy and his kidnapped bride succumb to a swampy grave an ancient egyptian curse is fulfilled the fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods shall be a cruel and violent death
<START> there can be no worse criticism for a movie than the word boring br br some bad movies are lots of fun some fun movies are really bad but to be boring means no one will ever buy the dvd to watch it over and over again br br it appeared to be a movie that employed the drama class from the antartic they were all too busy running around to stay warm instead of acting the lead actor spoke is a near whisper husky style voice damn it seemed that he was gonna seduce someone and he didn't care who br br the movie can't make money if it's boring i hope this one dies a swift never to be seen again death
<START> this unfortunately is a little known film i say unfortunately because it ranks up there with the classics of the american silent screen br br it's about a legend of a phantom chariot that all over the world picking up the souls of those who have died the legend says tha the last person to die on new year's eve is condemned to drive the chariot for the next whole year br br it brings to mind the sequence of the ghost of future yet to come in dicken's famous christmas carol br br the double exposure effects of the ghosts esp when they interact with the live people are excellent br br if you love silent films you must see this it will blow you away br br norm vogel br br norm's old movie heaven http www com film film html
<START> there is nothing worse than science fiction crafted by folks who don't have a feel for it grasping at a concept which wouldn't be so terrible by itself a future where cloning is common enough that it is necessary to make it a crime for you to breed with someone too close to you genetically the screenwriter proceeded to allow his ill suited imagination to run wild br br when tim robbins' character was able to guess a security guard's computer password simply by getting her to tell him one thing about herself i knew i was in for trouble this ability was later revealed to be due to robbins having taken an empathy virus viruses being used to grant instant or nearly instant skill upgrades to their users robbins' love interest complained about her own experience with such a virus a mandarin chinese language virus which allowed her to speak chinese but as she complained she couldn't understand what she was saying okay first off empathy no matter how intense isn't esp without incorporating some sort of true mind reading aspect like an empathy virus which actively releases into the vicinity infects nearby people picks up bits of their memory then departs for the original host which is as you can probably tell a smidgeon on the impractical side you can't justify being able to determine a specific detail like someone's password just by listening to the things you didn't say nor can you acquire the ability to speak a language without understanding what you're saying the virus can't infect your vocal cords and translate for you on the fly because a virus can't think to give you the power to speak chinese such a learning virus would have to modify your brain it would have to encode the knowledge among neurons and once it's in there it's yours you certainly understand what you're saying because you have to to use your own brain to perform a task you must understand that task for the most part unless of course they movie is suggesting that the virus was deliberately designed to put in place some bizarre multiple personality mental schism where some sub personae of yours functions as a built in one way translator br br the of languages spoken by the characters is decent enough although nowhere near remarkable enough to warrant all the love other reviewers have given what's more all the multicultural in the world can't make up for a simple frustrating fact the dialog stinks it's slow it's plodding and it's unnatural again i'm sure adherents have convinced themselves that the dull strangeness is simply the result of an inspired genius creating a truly futuristic and therefore subjected to linguistic drift form of speech i disagree good dialog is good dialog in any era and the same goes for tripe br br lastly i'll revisit the central concept of the movie the banning of sex with yourself widespread cloning is a nice classic sci fi topic so is global warming leading to ecological devastation which code 46 also incorporates unfortunately the two don't go together if you have an ecological disaster cutting down severely on the available living area you don't run around cloning people you have population problems enough as it is you don't add to them by cranking out re issues regular old fashioned sex and birth provides all the population you need and cloning of any sort would be ruthlessly suppressed br br to be fair the movie wasn't all bad it had some nice cinematography perhaps if i had watched it muted i could've enjoyed it
<START> while i am not a woman i can enjoy a chick flick if its good this one however is beyond bad you have the by the book story girl is getting divorced boy with issues shows up boom magic happens and his demons are banished as she realizes her life has a new purpose br br now while i can believe that kind of thing might happen i am not an idiot it wouldn't happen over a weekend of geriatric rumpy pumpy it would take time yet here the producers know they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes so they force the changes of the two to happen i suppose a night of getting hammered and a night of gramps and granny going at it like dogs in heat might be enough if you believed romance novels were the gospel but most people don't br br now if that isn't enough the producers remembered that a chick flick needs to make the viewer cry well they tried to make you cry with the two senior citizens getting jiggy with it by failed so how could they hit you again why i know lets kill off one of the characters for no good reason at all except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye and now lets have the teen daughter magically bond with heart broken mom for no reason besides the fact that it would be nice completely unreal but who cares br br so there you have it girl find boy boy find love death finds boy and mom cries what a movie not
<START> excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife gerda claire price as well of course as david suchet i did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point the ending which i won't divulge someone describes it on the board in answer to someone else's question if you are interested i found really sad despite agatha christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters i thought these really well rounded by and large br br the pacing of the story was good and i enjoyed seeing sarah miles as lucy and edward hardwicke cedric's son i believe in addition to being a well known dr watson as her husband
<START> good lord br br i'm going to say right off the bat i only watched 20 minutes of this movie as i am a hardcore eraserhead fan the what you can't watch a wierd black and white movie with little to no dialogue defense does not apply i simply can't watch terrible weird black and white movies with little to no dialogue br br this movie is what happens when you give an angsty goth child with no talent and nothing to say a camera and budget and let him her put as much meaninglessly offensive imagery on screen as possible it was clear from the start that this film should have been 5 minutes long assuming it should exist at all shots that should last a few seconds drag on for minutes because the director has i just love the sound of my own voice syndrome and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire piece of footage has been viewed from the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the corpse of god the opening scene of the film joy i knew it was only a matter of time until i turned off the tape after at least 10 minutes of a different corpse being pulled around twitching on a rope by a gang of cloaked mystery men i knew it was time to give up rarely do i give up on a movie i sat through the entirety of blair witch 2 book of shadows albeit not happily this did not deserve the 20 minutes i gave it br br if you're an eraserhead fan do not let simple minded comparisons to said film con you into renting this piece of amateur trash allow me to refer you to tetsuo the iron man for a watchable and enjoyable piece of incoherent black and white weirdness
<START> for sci fans this will be better than anything likely to be running on tv at any given time that's about the best you can say of it good points repartee and sense of humour is less dull than usual in such movies the plot is coherent and doesn't use any magical mystical revelations bad points the writers try to do good science but it falls down in direction and production eg a rock drilling mole using rock drilling equipment breaks surface underwater with nary a bubble or boiling cauldron to be seen the characters are clichÃ©'s and the plot unfolding is pretty stock standard ok for a too tired to do anything else type evening but don't expect any major edification or even talking points really
<START> drew barrymore gets second chance at high school on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter in flashbacks we see that the first time around was to put it mildly a major disaster david arquette is amusing in modest role as drew's brother who also enrolls to help out sis lots of subplots endanger but never overwhelm simple charm of movie drew keeps making her niche as major innocent sexy light comic actress
<START> set in hungary in november 1956 this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the uprising br br once the airport is closed the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to austria as would be obvious they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless yul brynner whose military power as a red army major was marked with loneliness his internal struggle between right and wrong his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings he was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contact br br robert morley plays the quintessential stiff upper lipped englishman who no matter how serious the role manages to maintain an almost light hearted logical outlook on life while jason robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career deborah kerr as the leading lady exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her character br br the film deals with a very tempestuous time in european history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great one liners and comedic instances that add to rather than detract from the movie the chemistry in the cat and mouse game between kerr and brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film together br br all in all a thoroughly engrossing movie which i would definitely watch again 8 10
<START> after reading the mostly glowing comments about this movie i decided to rent it despite some suspicions of tv movies i should have followed my instincts br br i tried so hard to warm up to the movie and find merit in it but i just couldn't the story never draws you in or rings true and the acting is perfunctory at best and laughable at worst everything in this production is amateurish br br always a joy to watch mary mcdonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation i won't even bother checking the name of the leading man hopefully he's back doing commercials br br even poor vanessa redgrave whom i adore and respect seemed to be channeling katherine hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really drugged in the home maybe she needed the money br br if i can save one person from wasting 100 minutes on this tripe i will feel vindicated
<START> steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous film mostly because it was so ground breaking this is because it was the first sound cartoon while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 br br now if this were just an important historical film it would be worth seeing especially to lovers of animation however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is while mickey and minnie behave a bit odd compared to the characters we have grown to love thanks mostly to the kooky mind and talent of animator ub there is an infectious charm about the film it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way clever and a real crowd pleaser this film still ranks among best films even after 80 wonderful years
