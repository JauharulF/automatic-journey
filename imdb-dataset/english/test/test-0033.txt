<START> one of chaplin's longest films up to that point burlesque on carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then prosper well known story about carmen i was a little confused about the difference between the imdb's listing of the 1915 burlesque on carmen and the 1916 version based on the running time i assume that it was the 1915 version that i saw since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer and from what i've read those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes br br from the very beginning it's clear that burlesque on carmen is one of chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts to date starting off with a long back story told through inter titles about the tragic love story of carmen br br carmen is sent by a band of gypsies a band who put the gyp in gypsy to seduce a spanish officer so they can pull off their smuggling operation it's a clever chaplinesque band of criminals the leader of whom has spent 50 years learning to steal thinking he might be offered a job in politics br br on a side note i've seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of chaplin's earlier work but probably none quite as overt as in this one near the beginning of the movie as the band of gypsies are traveling there is a scene where the mules and women are loading and an inter title explains that the mules are the ones with long ears in case you couldn't tell i guess br br chaplin plays the part of don jose the hapless officer who is to be seduced by carmen he is described as a brave soldier and lover of women not exactly a stretch for chaplin who removed any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant shoulder arms and of course he didn't have to act about being a lover of women br br what is different here of course is his polished military uniform and straight backed manner interspersed of course with some of his traditional slap stick moves he strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff stolid exterior br br soon carmen enters loved by all men under the age of and she immediately begins flirting with charlie i should mention that for a good majority of the movie it is surprisingly faithful to the original story which was full of jealousy and tragedy chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover able to evoke a jealous passion that i've never seen from him there's at least one scene where he is genuinely a little scary br br chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end and his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasn't very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on probably about five times longer than it was worth although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop i always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie sets br br the end of the film is it's strongest part it bears striking resemblance to romeo and juliet but just when you think that chaplin is going to conduct a major thematic experiment by from his traditional style there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage chaplin as anything i've ever seen nice work
<START> all that talent but when ya have poor direction and a weak screenplay it doesnt matter who is in a movie very tired attempt at telling a tale which was actually interesting in the beginning but then quickly fell apart toward the end to bad

<START> i own this movie on dvd and i have watched it about 10 times and it's still funny the jokes will never get boring and i often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them the premise is that richard and eddie of bottom fame own the cheapest hotel in britain next to a nuclear power plant they are desperately in need of cash and when a film star in hiding comes to stay their luck just might be in br br to watch this movie and not become utterly bored or disgusted you first need to like the humour some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it but overall it's a great movie
<START> this is a funny movie the bob eddie show feel of it could lead to a sequel but i doubt it will make enough money br br deniro proves he can be a great straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of cgi animals and rodents rene russo well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent br br some wild and unusual stunts especially the garbage truck scene this was worth seeing in the theater we needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out takes at the end do not leave at the start of the credits br br at least a 7
<START> leaving aside the drawbacks and deficiencies of the film mentioned by other viewers i must say that it seemed to me a film about power which is in my opinion one of the most luring illusions i saw the drama of an emperor and people it seems to me that the director wanted to pose a question of what the benefit of nation is and what the price of happiness for all is is there justification for the enforced benefit and happiness how much can be for the nation's security and peaceful existence is the idea of a powerful would be empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of its citizens now it seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs he is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin he seems to half hate his subjects for having to renounce his father and his love half love the people as a good emperor should no wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused it seems to me that as another film presenting the problem of power of man over other men the film is a success
<START> this is a really great film in the pulp fiction genre with a touch of film noir thrown in truly one of emma thompson's best performances to date this film has everything it's well written well directed beautifully films and has some great performances i don't know why it didn't catch on it's spectacular
<START> this is my first deepa mehta film i saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its sita character presented as i also note that it is radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not sita yet what i loved about the film was its screenplay by ms mehta not her direction the characters big and small were well developed and seemed quixotic towards the end somewhat like the end of an unmarried woman they are brave women surrounded by cardboard men and one cardboard man ashok seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him carrying his invalid mother he seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and to religion br br ms mehta seems to fumble as a director however compared to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the chinese micro minority in the social milieu of india she even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter not her father yet her radha of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field compare her to sen ali and she is dwarfed by these giants given her competent canadian production team and financial resources mehta's film of two bisexual ladies in an indian middle class household may be sacrilege to some but merely captures the atrophy of middle class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space malayalam and films have touched parallel themes in india but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable br br ms das ms azmi mr jafri and mr kharbanda are credible but not outstanding ms azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors sen's gautam paar a brilliance notably absent in this film ms das due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability all in all the film's strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema i am sure ms mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays
<START> i watched this movie recently and fell in love with it i loved the storyline and the actors it has a little of everything i was completely taken by the unfolding of the story it has so many surprises along the way i highly recommend it in fact i loved it so much that i ran out and bought the book i felt i had to read it in order to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie i also wanted to make sure i didn't miss anything that was in the book but kept out of the movie i recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book especially in the second episode to want to read it it has become my favorite movie i am now a sarah waters and elaine cassidy fan
<START> one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3 strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria i half wondered if blake edwards was naming the character played by elke sommer in a shot in the dark after this now forgotten performer though the spelling of the sommer character's surname was actually i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing la cucaracha that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances like that of ms that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy devine as a great bull fighter yeah right and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume only funny part of those two is when they cry with buster providing handkerchief to bull during the sad part of la cucaracha also lame was seeing ted healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking healy for other movie stars healy himself didn't know zeppo had left the marx brothers since he puts four between the and marx speaking of a marx it was interesting seeing harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head also interesting was seeing ida lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the vanities last year at least when announcer pete smith identified her oh and smith himself wasn't funny with his wise guy narration other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are m g m contract players either so with all that said la de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy garland's early film appearances or the early use of 3 strip technicolor
<START> this movie is powerful i watched this movie at 3 00 am and i was suppose to be at work at 6 00 am needless to say i was late to work i could not bring myself to get up off my bed to go to work this is the most powerful movie that i have seen in a long time and that made me cry and feel the pain of the family i think did a wonderful job of directing this film i agree with the previous comments from other views that this is the only movie that i have seen that has brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through what a veteran went through it is almost heart breaking to think that back then people just thought you could come home from a life changing experience and be the same person you were before you left kathy bates reminded me of my mother in a way i believe she really showed how women felt and acted back then i am surprised that this film wasn't up for more awards
<START> beware the scottish play in his riveting and harrowing opera dario argento returns to classic form regaining the composure he lost while filming convoluted and delirious psycho shockers like tenebre and phenomena indeed predicated on a simple narrative that is offset by opulent set pieces imaginatively brutal murder sequences and refined photography the film feels like the argento we once knew only real infraction is its lack of a score by goblin who provided unusual iconic and timeless music for many of argento's greatest films the opera selections used here are wonderful however br br the production is filled out by several competent actors while she's no jessica harper annabella sciorra lookalike cristina manages enough pluck and compassion to grasp the role of the tortured heroine ian charleson is interesting as horror film helmer turned opera director marco and daria is fantastic as always even in her relatively brief role watch the making of featurette on the dvd for a hilarious interview with about her role clearly brash and resentful over the end of her relationship with argento fans of stage fright another excellent 1987 giallo directed by michele who served as the second unit director for opera will barely recognize the final girl from that film barbara as a stage manager here i think it's the glasses that do it br br with me it's often the little things that matter and argento's fascination obsession with solitary nightmarish images makes him my ideal filmmaker opera is full of minor details that left me smirking for instance i love that we never see the great mara face i also love the scene where the killer is scraping the tip of his her deadly sharp dagger across a television screen showing betty's performance as lady macbeth finally i defy even the most grizzled slasher veterans not to cringe as the pin grates are placed over betty's eyes br br in short opera is a clean tense and taut thriller with its solid performances lucid focus and literate cinematography it begs to be in the same league as deep red and the bird with the crystal plumage might opera be the last great giallo
<START> a made for television version of the heart of darkness seemed like a good way to add more insight to the book well that was the wrong assumption the movie made it even worse i was highly disappointed about almost everything in the movie i hoped that the movie would possibly help put the pieces of the book together that i didn't comprehend but it did no such thing it still left me confused and hanging it is one of those movies that makes one feel like it would be more fun to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie not exactly anyone's cup of tea it was an overall dreadful boring and slow movie br br to begin with nicolas roeg must have been pretty desperate when he decided that he wanted to undertake the task of making the already boring book into a movie it's a guaranteed loss it's like going into a knife fight but forgetting the knife on the kitchen counter the person is going to lose and in the case the person was roeg all i've heard about the movie are bad things and the movie deserves those bad things to be said about it from watching the movie i got the impression that the people who made the movie just skimmed over the book to get the key points br br furthermore although the movie did follow the main story line of the book it left out quite a few details and it also changed the ending i am not a fan of that roeg left out when marlow and his crew came across the russian sailor's camp and at that camp they found the book also it didn't show when at the camp they came across the sign that says wood for you hurry up approach cautiously conrad 110 also at the end of the book kurtz dies on the boat not at the inner station br br on the contrary nicolas roeg did one good thing while he was making his movie he managed to hire some pretty decent actors to play in the movie for instance he acquired tim roth and john malkovich both of whom would later go on to have successful careers in doing so he added a little something to the horrible movie also though i am ripping his book to shreds i do have some respect for him because it takes a lot of courage to try to take on the heart of darkness it isn't exactly the easiest novel to portray into a film a valiant effort though in conclusion if for whatever reason someone actually wants to watch this movie i suggest the reading of heart of darkness first this way you'll get all of the scenes that were left out of the movie and you won't be completely lost when you watch it but i really suggest you don't read the book and that you really don't watch the movie both will be a complete waste of your time trust me i was forced to do both by my english teacher and now i wish that the book and the movie didn't exist if either the book or the movie are pursued good luck
<START> first let me say that although i generally appreciate mike judge's work i've been merely tepid in my response to office space king of the hill and beavis and butthead i generally prefer more intelligent comedy and therein lies the irony with respect to idiocracy br br in a future world where the embodiment of beavis and views basest instincts and intellectual capacities are the framework of a chaotic messy semi mad max semi blade runner society where every trailer trash guy's fantasy becomes reality a man with even average intelligence is threatening and accused of talking gay and the mob mentality takes over and this world is also incredibly funny br br yes it's obvious that carl's jr starbucks costco and executives will be horrified at the twisted values given their products in the year br br there were some missed opportunities with the film and the relationship between the time travelers the other being an average intelligence woman who's worried about her boyfriend's pimp's retribution could have been stronger the chemistry is there and there don't seem to be too many women in the future br br i did leave with a grin on my face but the experience is a bit better than the memories thus it's my kind of popcorn film and it will be fun to revisit on video recommended fyi stay through the credits for an extra scene
