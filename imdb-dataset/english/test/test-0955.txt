<START> it has been years since i have been privileged to see this movie on tv i only wish i could contact someone to see it again i married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome i didn't' realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how i can love them and help them overcome their difficulties my step son is now 35 and thank the lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother we speak every month to rehab patients with alcohol and drug addictions and this sharing has truly made monumental changes in their behaviors and endeavors to start out a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol please please let me know how i can get a copy vhs or dvd of this movie or when they will show the movie again on tv if you have not been in these shoes you probably could never understand its value thank you so very much
<START> i am ashamed to admit in public that i even held the cover of this movie once this is an absolute reason why one should research on the movie before seeing it the of this movie have called us all fools and gullible losers with too much time on our hands br br based on the mythical indian shape shifting powerful cobras and rebirth the story takes us for a painful ride college going 40 actors now really are the target of their former friend who was in her former life a cobra but is now a ghost and her pathetic eternal powerful boyfriend cobra killing machine boyfriend who thankfully hasn't been seen since now do you need to know more br br i vote for studying for the upcoming test in school rather than this movie give it a pass if you are sane if not then you'll probably enjoy it
<START> this story is about a safari in africa that meets some guy named trent who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes naturally they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men the rest is pretty predictable br br this movie has everything you'd expect in a bargain basement movie about africa the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage film of animals that are not native to the continent such as orangutans moose and ground hogs a white actor in dark makeup playing a native bad acting particularly from trent a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood comic relief sounding like chico marx a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini clad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors like a tribe of angry female tarzans by the look of it my assumption is that the movie was made for under 49 95 including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit but what i didn't expect was an imdb score of 4 9 this is poor but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated that high now i am not saying the film isn't worth seeing it's campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewing particularly with friends just don't expect anything resembling a professionally made or competent film br br finally here's a smattering of the dialog from this jungle classic br br like strong white man want strong white man br br br br me te tonga no 'kill' man
<START> not many people outside poland have had an opportunity to become familiar with brilliant writings he's very popular in poland for his fantasy short stories i believe none of them has ever been translated english alas to make a long story short the main character of books is a traveling monster slayer a man of extraordinary strenght and skill he's pretty much your favourite tolkien style cool guy unfortunately no one would figure this out after watching the film the movie is nothing but a collection of random scenes featuring and other characters from writings but not remotely resembling the plot and dramatic pace of the original event the fact that some of the shots in the film show attractive naked women does not add any quality to it the movie gets worse and worse with every minute and does not even meet the requirements of 'so bad it's actually good' category if you really are into and want to learn something about read the books instead
<START> this digital horror film brings us into the micro budget film genre where the more blood and chicks in distress the better the story is weak the acting is respectable and the special effects well they're special alright a quality horror film for the fans that already know what to expect
<START> flashes of lightning a sprawling cemetery the name of adam 'batman' west all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over and yet despite these rather naff elements one dark night isn't as cheesy as it might first seem br br meg tilly jennifer's sister plays pretty student julie who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique the sisters what julie doesn't realise is that the other plan to freak her out with some ghoulish that the most recent body to be interred in the mausoleum is that of vampire' who feeds off the life force of scared young women br br admittedly this isn't the most original of set ups but thankfully there are enough inventive touches to help set this film apart from the competition my favourites being the macabre sight of everyday objects embedded in the walls of apartment and the creepy manner in which mouldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent finale hal impressive steadicam cinematography and tom wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the chilling atmosphere
<START> this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers it's certainly all been done before and since but the violent men is something special br br what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films she's married to the crippled edward g robinson who's the cattle baron here but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent no matter to barbara whose needs are being met by her brother in law brian keith that doesn't sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwyck's daughter nor with lita milan who is keith's mexican girl friend br br the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here he's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford's mouth i'm a man would have been very applicable in the men br br the fifties was the age of the adult western themes were entering into horse operas that hadn't been explored before the following year glenn ford would do another western one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component br br there's enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well
<START> yes i really found this film distasteful br br i didn't like the sandra oh character she really annoyed me it is unlikely she would be accepted into rural italian life due to the fact she is non white this was a bit of pc nonsense br br the film is also offensive to italian men for instance the one man she diane lane has an affair is turns out to be a cheat but guess what at the end your typically plasticky american brick head turns up all cheesy white smile and tan and she finally finds what she wants all along a real american man and now she has colonized another part of the world br br in fact this film is quite racist in its depiction of italians and the way it subjugates them as either smarmy lotharios or backward peasants br br the photography was good but the film and its attitude were trash
<START> new guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow drivers in order to score some quick cash the problem is that they really don't have much of a plan and when complications arise things turn deadly br br fast moving popcorn action film has a great deal going with it first off the film is under 90 minutes so the film doesn't really have the time to bog down in plot it cranks everything up and just goes next the film has some great action sequences so one moves towards the edge of ones seat lastly the film has a stellar cast that include matt dillon jean reno and lawrence fishburne its a first rate cast that sells and covers over the stories short comings br br this isn't brain surgery its a popcorn movie and on that level it scores highly worth a look
<START> this film was produced by producers releasing corp prc among the so called poverty row film studios of the 1930s and 40s so you can imagine how little money was spent making it br br the music is forgettable cast member young does exhibit an operatic quality voice but is sort of a discount deanna durbin the imdb database doesn't show any other film appearances for her so let's hope she was able to move on to some kind of position in grand opera br br the opening credits for the print recently broadcast by turner classic movies indicates this film has been preserved by the national film museum this immediately begs the br br are their resources so plentiful that they can afford to preserve junk some low budget or b musicals of that era have redeeming features which make them worthwhile this film has none br br in my opinion skip this movie it really wastes an hour of your time
<START> this movies had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my entire life i laughed so hard i almost puked after the movie was done i laughed for about an hour just thinking about the very last seen in the movie its is definitely 100 times better than the first jackass movie i loved seeing all of them back together again if you are squeamish or don't like raunchy childish humour you will not like this movie if you can go in with an open mind and not take it so seriously then you will laugh your ass off its amazing no one was killed in this movie every seen in this movie is so original and so different from the next you will not know what to expect br br mike webber
<START> i had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for new year's and she picked out the swan princess the mystery of the enchanted kingdom and the little mermaid 2 and we just watched both films while she's sleeping i figured i could get a couple comments in while this is a very cheesy cartoon it really wasn't that bad you have to admit that for children these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction of these stories to them br br odette finds out that derek has been secretly keeping the magic secrets of and she tells derek to destroy them immediately but him being a guy typically he does not do so and tells her that no on could achieve the without his help when a witch named zelda gets her hands on them she finds out that derek tore off the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything and she kidnaps odette in order to retrieve this information br br the swan princess the mystery of the enchanted kingdom is silly and predictable but for the kids i would honestly say it's a go it's so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days so i'm going to cut the film some slack it was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden i grew up with the first one so i guess it was just stuck in my head br br 4 10
<START> hey i know angel isn't the kind of show that gives people a happy ending and i know they couldn't just make everything perfect but i couldn't believe the ending to angel i absolutely love the show it's possibly the best show ever however i really hated this ending as well as the whole way the 2nd half of angel season 5 went similar to buffy season 7 my favorite characters deaths were pretty much pointless and did nothing for the plot was one of the best characters on the show and once she and angel were finally going to get together she turned all evil and into a demon i wanted so badly to have her back don't get me wrong the episode where comes back is fantastic but i was still really mad she was gone then on earth was up with fred dying right after she finally got with wesley there was no sacrifice it was pointless it did nothing whatsoever for the plot and blue haired demon girl is an awful useless character they spent way too much of the end centered around her another big problem is they didn't connect the elements well enough i know those dudes in that black thorn wanted to bring about the apocalypse but there wasn't even a date set for when it was supposed to happen the apocalypse should have been carried out and discovered throughout the entire season rather than just mentioning there are some evil dudes an hour before the season ends one of the biggest problems is every character who the audience cares about is either dead or has nothing to live for my three favorite characters died and angel spike and gunn who i'm not sure even survives have no office aren't even back to their helping the helpless are in the middle of a huge battle and have lost everyone they care about angel and spike are never redeemed they lose the girl they care about and just about everyone's dead and they still have to fight this weird evil army i get the whole you never stop fighting but it was stupid to end it right in the middle couldn't there have been some redemption with knowledge that there would always be many more battles to come i don't get why this episode is so highly rated because i think the buffy ending was 10 times better and i wasn't even a giant fan of that one why did they have to slip at the end season 3 and 4 and 1st half of five were so amazing then they went and messed up the show
<START> i came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non holiday films as you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it br br stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts dennis morgan's acting is strong also he goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor check out kitty in this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos stanwyck away from her husband to be br br this is a christmas classic the settings and the story make for a great christmas romance
