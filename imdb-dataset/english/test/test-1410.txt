<START> so i was energized during my snakes on a plane weekend after the movie we craved some more why not snakes on a train how bad could it possibly be its snakes probably killing people on trains the snakes were supposed to be first off me and my buddies thought the snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same cheesy rattling sound clip we actually sat through the entire thing completely ready to turn it off we're too lazy to walk over and hit eject next thing we knew we don't know what the heck was going on but something amazingly funny happens at the end it's one of those endings that you'll rewind a few times just to squeeze the laughs out because you suffered for so long br br last 10 min a 8 rest of the movie a 2
<START> this film is an impressionistic poetic take on the immigrant experience a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with these are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to america in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm if ignorance that poor illiterate sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the united states br br they have some fantastic unrealistic notions about the united states which are disseminated on the trip over one is that the rivers run with milk an image which is depicted in the movie to poetic impressionistic effect the film is devoid of sound and the silence seems to reflect the uneasiness of the ignorance the locals have about life in america or if not ignorance of it a vision significantly colored with superstition and fantasy br br that said the movie depicts with jolting realism the boat ride to the united states and the intake process which arrivals at ellis island had to undergo the boat ride is imagined as rather dull which surely it was much of the time the quarters in which the incoming residents sleep is depicted as extremely crowded with beds spaced four or five inches from one another and lacking much light which it was surely the case below deck br br again the film is not supplemented with undue music or excessively bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic imagining of what it was truly like for people to the united states the villagers may not be worldly but they are quite reasonable and the interaction with the eldest of the aurora with the immigration officer who insists on particular results are quite bittersweet inasmuch as they are not diluted or softened for the benefit of a syrupy conclusion and one sees the melding of the realism of sicily with the extensive regulations which guide life in the united states br br the immigrants and their story are very interesting and the combination of cold eyed realism and the magical fantasy of peoples' imaginations make for a persuasive vision of the beliefs held by or any people with little formal education moving to the united states the acting is similarly barebones it is not at all demonstrative or showy but seems the more realistic for it that said all the main performers in particular salvatore mancuso vincenzo amato the clear leader of the group is excellent while never smiling his character's actions speak much louder and it is clear that thankfully the other members of the group his two sons and the above mentioned elder the boys' grandmother have faith in his leadership abilities and respect his clear leadership amato imbues his character with great decency and and it is a testament to his abilities that his character appears so capable and confident while his character betrays very little emotion br br one oddness of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious englishwoman the excellent and fittingly mysterious charlotte gainsbourg who speaks italian and during the entire film we wonder why she is going to the united states or what connection she has to the otherwise unanimously sicilian emigrant group at the end this is finally revealed and the revelation is done typically realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or showy br br the film is directed by emmanuel who has a firm grasp on the realistic if sometimes superstitious world view his characters inhabit and presents it competently and confidently it is in fact fantastically confident given how awkwardly the realism and superstition might have combined in the film it is a worthy examination of the immigrant experience
<START> if you want an excellent survey of byzantine history done in colorful fashion this is for you this documentary would also be excellent for educators who are teaching about roman or medieval history this documentary is divided into three portions first dealing with the fall of the western roman empire the rise of christianity and the beginning of the byzantine empire the second video deals with byzantine diplomacy and the iconoclastic controversy the third and final video explains the decline and fall of the series is shot in several countries and beautifully integrates byzantine history into the realities of the modern world showing the place of this civilization as part of human civilization in general do take the time to watch
<START> frank sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best if i had to name the best thing he ever did though it would be his performance as frankie machine the heroin addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved just barely by the love of a good woman played by an exceptionally kim novak the cold turkey scenes between sinatra and novak are terrifying and heartbreaking the movie is very nearly perfect in fact from saul title graphics to the ground breaking jazz score by elmer bernstein it might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s but it's a must see nevertheless
<START> as i watched this movie i felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head the acting was horribly stifling and it was bad acting the most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid out in state in a coffin i felt nothing but relief when it was finally over i was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath all around it was stupid no beginning no climax no ending just rambling on and on and the plastic bag kept getting worse let's get real here this is an awful movie
<START> this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today horribly predictable obscene usage of slow motion photography cheesy story lines chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment i will give the series some credit though it does get entertaining at times but not enough for it make any difference with all the negative points this series has i still prefer it over reality tv it can't really get any more worthless than that
<START> slasher fare which feels overly long at 80 minutes years ago a bunch of gypsies who lived in the caves of a mountain were burned up in a forest fire years later campers are going missing from the area of the fire a bunch of horny kids are of course en route to this area for a camping trip of there own despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger jackson bostwick the kids troop up to the mountain any way before long the kids start to get picked off by the monster who remains unseen to the very end of the movie probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad no surprises to speak of they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates leaving the final girl to fend for herself although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster br br the story itself couldn't hold the weight of feature length so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release on the plus side the wildlife footage is rather nice also among the highlights are bostwick talking to a baby deer a decent rock climbing death sequence ok gore and the great jackie coogan in his final film role as the bumbling local sheriff this is a far cry from charlie chaplin but it was still nice to see him this is for slasher completists only
<START> i really liked this movie number 5 the star robot of the movie gets hit by lightning and some thing happened to his circuits he act and thinks more like a human the robot repeats commercials he learns after watching tv he then applies these sayings to his circumstances number 5 is quick witted and funny the character imitates voices of stars tries to dance like john travolta in staying alive and a lot of other things he has a saying for most of his circumstances that he memorized the actions of the robots is really good number 5 wants to drive cook and please with all the characteristics of a human the way the robots move and line up is really hysterical i am disappointed that the writers could not keep this clean for all viewers this movie has a ending something you would not expect i hate movies that have swearing in them even though i like them i give them a lower rating this movie had swearing words jesus christ was used as swearing word which offends me it is used a least 3 times g d d m bull sh t etc it could have been a wonderful movie with out all this offensive language there is no sex in this film some violence like robots blowing up cars and machines
<START> this movie is full of pseudo deep thoughtfulness and it's cloying in its ness that includes a canned ham voice over and some unbelievable dialogue dialogue that is tinny and tone deaf the way spike sometimes not always is when writing certain characters for those that like nonsense films like pieces of april and one hour photo this is another one for you br br that said this comment is nothing against ryan gosling who has shown his awesome chops in the believer a film that proves that movies are a director's medium and when a movie is rotten it's fair to say the fault lies there and not in the actors
<START> this feeble attempt at veering your typically bland japanese horror movie more towards a creepy cult hit did not have the ammunition needed to keep the viewer involved throughout translated to vortex is about just that an irrational and tribute to the strange downward spiral into nothingness that has seemingly captivated a whole small town into dementia obsessed lunatics while this certainly makes for a pleasurable b movie on the surface the traditionally tiresome acting direction and script will have all but asian horror buffs shaking their heads in dismay what could have roughly translated into japanese equivalent of an early david lynch piece instead wares out it's spiraled gimmickry before it even has a chance to explain itself which of course it does not aside from a few clever techniques employed the movie rarely connects the dizzying thematics with the dull script ultimately coming across as a cheap exploitation into the cult genre substituting hollow imagery for genuine substance when the movie had ended there was hardly anything that was gained from any of the interactions save a tiny few scenes or images that rose above the one note film i do applaud the makers for at least trying to take the genre into more supernatural metaphysical realms and understand the rough losses lost in translation but with zero substance to back any of it's up this will likely be relegated to obscure fanboy's bong ridden basements
<START> yes maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn't take anything away from the film's charm and wonder it was shown as part of our town's youth film festival and was the organising favourite which is not surprising the subject matter coming together in a race torn though post apartheid south africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational of course as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings i saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children a film to watch meditate discuss and act upon
<START> possible spoilers warning br br you never know the guy keeps telling he's an alien but oops seems to be the most human in the whole story arrived from distant planet said weird things advanced the earth's science healed the doctor or was it just a crazy dream you never know better see k pax for yourself think br br great acting of all the cast don't forget to notice the music it's right in a place lot of fun some sadness 8 of 10 after all
<START> while the romance in this film is an important aspect it is largely about the role of responsibility and duty in modern indian all of the major characters were well fleshed out and had their own inner life i recommend this strongly
<START> while sleeping mr eko is assigned by his brother mccormack in a dream to go with john locke to disclose the meaning of the symbol with the pretext of chasing henry mr eko brings john with him and they find a second hatch called pearl underground the question mark symbol marked on the field where a video explains that the other hatch is a psychological experiment and people behavior pressing the buttons of the computer every 108 minutes are actually subjects meanwhile jack unsuccessfully tries to save libby br br in this episode john locke loses his faith in the island when he finds that they have been monitored in the hatch the disgusting michael sees the anguishing libby wishing that she was dead while hurley jack kate and sawyer are suffering her pain in a deep emotional contrast my vote is eight br br title brazil not available
<START> overall a well done movie there were the parts that made me wince and there were the parts that i threw my hands up at but i came away with something more than i gone in with br br i think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition without spoiling it let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in ramayana is way beyond what this movie stands for the ramayana is an epic not a 200 page book that puts down women in india the movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive indian family while the basic tenets of the unwritten laws of the family tradition seem to be that of conservative india let me assure my reader that i having lived in delhi for 12 years found entire parts that just did not ring those bells i mean some things and some actions are very true but some other stuff is just way off the mark especially today br br delhi is complicated india is complicated the director tries to simplify both and fails pretty miserably at that br br why in english can you imagine a movie about american indians in english or the french speaking in english seriously jarring even the servant spoke in fluent accented english albeit with a hint of colloquialisms in the language for believability br br but the chemistry between the leads is palpable if you like it hot this is a movie for you i think that is the biggest saving grace the development of a true real life love story br br if this film was about radha and sita then it would have got full marks from me and in being about them it could have made a subtle statement but this movie goes out there to say this is what india is and this is what indian society is like and in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails just take everything you see with a pinch of salt the dark secrets of india are not being revealed just two girls are falling in love just like it happens everywhere else
