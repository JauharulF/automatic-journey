<START> this could have been a good biopic but what a mess i had this film when i was a theater manager when i put the film together and watched it i thought i had some reels out of order as it turned out i didn't and if i did nobody would have noticed i couldn't figure out what's going on everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way
<START> we went to see manna from heaven my husband two friends and i and we all enjoyed the film the characters are funny the story is amusing and so much like real life i think that is what i liked most just seeing something believable no murders no sci fi just good clean fun it is something you could take your children or elderly parents to and not worry how many of those are around anymore
<START> under no circumstances watch this film it is terrible for a number of reasons br br no plot no structure no direction no acting to speak of no visual style no tension br br in a word no br br best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends who would have thought could feel so long br br once again under no circumstances watch this film it is terrible br br no plot no structure no direction no acting to speak of no visual style no tension br br in a word no br br best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends who would have thought could feel so long
<START> well here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie the entire movie is set in a zombie plagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters what good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate and why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place as if people would not go on to kill this dangerous threatening monsters when they are not getting paid br br needless to say that the story for the quick and the undead is far from a tight one it of course also isn't being filled with the most logical and interesting moments characters or dialog br br still it's not a completely horrible movie it certainly ain't as bad as some people try to make you believe it is it's a rather good looking one or rather said the movie at least doesn't have a cheap look over it it's effects may be a bit overused but nevertheless they are quite good looking as are the make up effects as well br br still the movie was not what i hoped of it its title might suggest that the movie is set in the wild wild west during the days of the cowboys but its title is just a misleading one no doubt picked to cash in on it i fell for it expecting this movie to be a combination of a western and a gory zombie horror flick br br for the fans of the zombie movies this movie will mostly be a disappointment to watch it of course adds nothing new to the genre but it also doesn't has enough of the genre itself in it to be considered a good one to watch br br not totally unwatchable but also far from a recommendable one br br 4 10
<START> dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except tedium city a low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects not recommended for any reason the best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the nevada desert that's it i can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker the finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest oh i thought of one other good point about this cheese it clocks in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then when the girl starts walking around in the desert at night it seems to last forever and just keeps getting worse from there the attempts at horror aren't effective in the least the story is an attempt at a twilight zone style feel but fails badly check out for a good science fiction b movie
<START> this is an exceptional film it is part comedy part drama part suspense the dialog is exquisite most of the actors and actresses were very famous in their time and for good reason you will probably recognize someone even if you don't usually watch older movies they are also each in a role that particularly suits their talents br br one correction to make on another users comment is that two people not one are announced to die in the accident maybe the unlucky two are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life the movie is too engaging to worry about who it is until it happens br br the story is ahead of its time but it does not lose the quality of an older movie time and effort was spent perfecting the camera's view and the soundtrack something modern movie makers tend to forget
<START> this movie came aside as a shock in the eighties far from trends that is to say in the heart of sincere creativity stands as one of the finest movies of its time stephane the wonderful actress of her ex husband claude chabrol's greatest achievements le la rupture les noces rouges all unqualified musts for movie buffs gave a lifetime performance to see her prepare with love and affection her meal is a feast for the eyes all the people who saw this masterpiece actually tasted ate babette's culinary triumph but the most moving part of the story is its conclusion babette was a great french chef she was famous now she found a new homeland but her heyday is behind her and she won't never be allowed to come back to her dear france so the two old sisters do comfort her in heaven there will be huge kitchens where she cooks for eternity while sharing her fortune with her new friends babette changed their life she gave them pleasure and a magic evening they would remember forever in this simple but extraordinary screenplay human warmth is everywhere and i wish everybody a babette's feast would it be only for one starry night
<START> three american lads are backpacking their way around europe challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can but andy seeks true love he finds this during their jump attempt on the eiffel tower when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart burstingly beautiful julie delpy his attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action romance gore and inspired humor without ever taking itself to seriously or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride i have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the 'london' original although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel
<START> clint eastwood plays a wounded union soldier found by a girl from a confederate boarding school and he's taken in and nursed back to health instead of turned over to confederate soldiers seems that the women folk at this place have ulterior motives geraldine paige the headmistress justifies not turning him into the confederacy and even passes him off as her cousin of course when the man gets to feeling better he becomes quite the lady's man and is pretty much making the rounds but when he gets busted he really gets busted in fact so badly he gets his leg cut off but it's for his own good of course not out of retribution things get carried a bit further though when certain women don't get what they want i haven't seen this for years and it still has a certain creepiness to it that by today's standards is still pretty strange not typical eastwood at all if you haven't seen this one it's worth seeing 8 out of 10
<START> despite all of the comparisons to house of frankenstein this movie outshines its predecessor and is one of the funnest monster movies in the universal monsters series and sadly the last o k so it doesn't exactly stack up to something like the bride of frankenstein as one a classic to revered by fans of all movies but with a cast of dracula the wolf man and frankenstein's monster what no mummy you can't help but enjoy this schlock fest and unlike house of frankenstein the monsters in this movie interact a lot more but this movie also offers some unique story lines for both dracula and the wolf man who both go to dr for cures of their afflictions while the wolf man actually does find a cure dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that's when the real fun begins i highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies but remember i never said it was good just fun
<START> tiny toons is the first cartoon i remember watching as a child and i loved every minute of it when i was four or five my parents purchased the video how i spent my vacation i watched it over and over again until i new every word well a few days ago my three year old cousin came over and i had to entertain him i decided to show him this old relic of my childhood br br i new he would laugh but i was surprised how much i laughed like every tiny toons film and episode the humor is based more on wackiness and slapstick humor and succeeds tremendously bugs babs plucky duck pig and fifi all endure amazing adventures from bugs and babs white water rafting with a little help from superman plucky duck and pig travel to the greatest amusement park only to ride the monorail and goes on an odd quest to find cute kittens in a safari land br br some of the classic humor stands in this tiny toon adventure and is some of the best wacky comedy i've ever seen my favorite gag had to be the monorail thing when and plucky arrive ride the monorail and leave much to dismay no matter what your age you'll laugh yourself to tears while not having to deal with language and nudity br br tiny toons adventures how i spent my vacation starring the voices of charles adler tress macneille joe alaskey and don messick br br 5 out of 5 stars
<START> first of all blythe danner doesn't look anywhere near old enough to play capshaw's daughter and in fact she isn't only ten years apart br br i understand this is supposed to be one of those magical moonstruck type supernatural romances but this is beyond the pale very very weak in terms of acting script and direction br br the only one who really shines here is ellen degeneres who makes this film watchable if not really believable herself as she's cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound but endearing nonetheless actually degeneres and the skin shots of the young guy capshaw with together make this watchable but no one can really tell if capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and we're left to wonder how she really feels
<START> since the magus is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution one should sit back and enjoy the scenery set on a remote greek island it stars a very uptight michael caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko mystery man anthony quinn and his daffy girlfriend candice bergen quinn looking like pablo picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt is actually pretty good but caine looks like he's ready to explode bergen although stunning should not put on a british accent ever she's not very good at that type of thing guy green's direction is fine but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film you will not enjoy it a real sour note is the casting of the effervescent anna in the completely joyless role of caine's girlfriend after seeing her in the likes of a woman is a woman and a band apart her presence here is quite jarring
<START> i'm warning you this movie is not scary if you're a horror movie fan especially a child's play fan you'll think it's incredibly funny but you won't be scared it's not a bad movie but it's not scary
