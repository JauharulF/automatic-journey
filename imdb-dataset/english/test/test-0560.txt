<START> warning miserable movie warning the day before christmas eve some nut case decided he'd entertain us by sending this movie as on tv what in gods name was he thinking br br this movie is filled with awful humor despicable acting lousy jokes and a disaster of a plot line randy quaid plays the idiotic role as cousin eddie johnson eddie is a brain dead person who's incapable of even the simplest tasks he was fired because he was dumb as a brick but the company he worked for was sorry for it so they sent him and his family on a vacation but being as stupid as he is he managed to make the vacation into a disaster br br all in all it's the worst movie i've seen and i have nightmares still over the miserable acting and the even more miserable jokes in this movie it's so sad you almost have to see it but don't the nightmares i have are far worse than any other nightmares you will ever have trust me i hate this movie so bad because of it's acting the humor the jokes and the story the only good thing was the nice scenery br br well it's my opinion and i surely hope everyone agrees with me

<START> in following dylan moran's star from the charming misanthrope bookstore owner in the surrealist sitcom black books i could see his comic potential begging to be utilised in theater or larger cinematic avenues this first big screen outing in a starring role he had a cameo as rufus the thief in notting hill had oodles of promise but like the strained steve coogan vehicle the parole officer has too many which should have been ironed out in preproduction br br the plot is so convoluted that i shan't bother repeating the finer details the script has every character do that for us and the laughs are sourced from show business in jokes michael caine is a pompous has been running a production of richard iii updated to nazi occupation one of the few genuine laughs a satirical jab at ian mckellen in which everyone is forever doing the hitler salute every time they take the stage convincing dylan that acting should be a conceptual act unto itself the two plot to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters by way of their acting prowess confusion ensues both on screen and in the audience there's a romantic sub plot between dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters blah blah blah and dylan gets to dress in odd clothes and do funny accents michael caine delivers some choice lines and dylan's comic timing is on the money so why isn't it any good it does have a certain charm that you would expect from film 4 but it also has a precocious little girl acting as compass in a muddled and irrelevant plot a no no in screen writing 101 exposition overshadows everything else you just want to see moran and caine acting as comic foil to each other the way the were at the beginning but when they're together toward the end the the pairing has lost its charisma br br the actors is an amusing albeit underwhelming effort should it come on telly during a rainy tuesday afternoon then have at you otherwise you would be better off watching your old black books videos or renting withnail i
<START> end of days is one of the worst big budget action movies i've ever seen muddling direction meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes rapid fire mtv style editing and poor acting all the way br br that's not to say end of days isn't watchable the movie kept me interested because i found ah latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker which is why end of days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the u s br br i won't go into the details explaining why end of days violates the law of movie logic but here are several problems with this movie br br spoiler br br after the devil walks out the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it no snapping finger no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire nothing how could this happen br br arnold and his annoying sidekick kevin pollack somehow magically comes up with the name christine york after examining the phrase christ in new york carved on a victim's body runs the database on the computer and viola christine york the only person with the exact name in all of new york city beyond my suspension of disbelief br br how did the characters who have come in contact with arnold's character turn against him later in the movie i laughed out loud when i recognized the good stepmother turned evil stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in william shakespeare's romeo juliet her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagine br br all the mindlessly huge explosions and what did you expect in the arnold schwarzenegger vehicle br br the devil took a man's body comprising of flesh and blood yet he's invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body logically this is impossible br br as the devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment arnold's character runs into the solid christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and falls on it physically br br the devil is capable of punching the person's brains out and twisting a victim's head 180 degree yet he could not kill arnold's character as he always intends to br br how the devil's object of parents died and why evil new yorkers run after arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all br br in the sequence that's a rip off of speed arnold and the devil's object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed this is beyond my comprehension since the force would be enough to throw arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impact br br arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall yet the devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience's sake br br at the beginning of the movie after the devil took over a man's body all of a sudden arnold is his bodyguard is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing br br arnold's recital of cringe inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like you are a compared to me are the perfect fodder for mst3k just as eraser did with the classic line you're the luggage br br the whole theory about 666 1999 is downright ludicrous so are the pseudo religious babble about the christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the devil's object of desire br br end spoilers br br it is highly ironic that end of days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about christian theories the level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot the director's indulgence of excess is a factor here he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money br br hence end of days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness arnold's worst since hercules in new york br br br br br br br br br br
<START> this is the worst hindi film i have ever seen it conforms to all the stereotypes of bad hindi films the plot is ridiculous the acting over the top and shah rukh manages to fit in a couple of song sequences even though he is playing the character of a dumb man
<START> ocean's twelve just plain stupid bad and nothing compared to the other two br br an art robbery 10 known actors at least a weak script and very slow developing idea that's why i characterize a movie i only saw at least 20 minutes of it don't get me wrong you may like it but i only like the ocean's films because of the heist theme if ocean's 12 it's not about heist then what's the point to see it glad soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one kudos for that br br steven soderberg isn't really a good director apart from his hit sex lies and videotapes nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director shame on him but his fault only
<START> there was a video out in america called that featured about an hours worth of banned cartoons br br most of them were wwii era that's where i first saw and heard of this one br br the rooster during the opening news broadcast turns into a with an asian face saying a doodle doo please ' after that it's eight minutes of propaganda played out like a newsreel br br viscously racist but when you look at it as the piece of history it is it can and should be forgiven br br slicing ration cards to make sandwiches br br showing the ruins of rome while calling 1 ' br br a minesweeper using a broom br br a manned bomb with the pilot saying me out of here ' br br and of course the stereotyping every japanese was drawn with big teeth constantly bowing and saying at the end of every broken sentence br br the funniest bit the air raid siren that was two bowing men stabbing each other in the tush with pins oooo oooooo br br hey aol let this one out it deserves notice my wife laughed at this and she's 100 japanese
<START> uproarious no brainer comedy in which comedian mark blankfield portrays jekyll as an uptight doctor deeply committed to his research once he's his experimental formula he's turned into the scenery devouring hyde causing no end of problems for everybody around him br br i was pleasantly surprised by this one it has a truly insane madcap approach it's full steam ahead with one outrageously stupid yet undeniably hilarious joke after another funny lines and sight gags are in abundance blankfield plays each role for all it's worth one highlight has hyde bursting into song hyde's got nothing to hyde is quite catchy and even now i can still hear it in my head the climax even goes so far as to spoof old b w horror films br br the supporting cast is quite spirited as well with bess armstrong as the ditzy fiancÃ©e mary krista as the spunky ivy and tim thomerson as flamboyant fellow doctor i do wish more could have been done with character as i'm a fan of the man but it's always nice to see him in something br br a large array of familiar faces parade before the camera cassandra elvira peterson peter liz sheridan george wendt michael ensign john dennis johnston art la lin shaye and george chakiris in a cameo as himself br br it goes without saying that if you prefer highbrow intelligent comedy you'd better avoid this one at all costs but for those who enjoy a zany politically incorrect gleefully raunchy good time this just might do the trick br br one of the best bits is saved for last br br 8 10
<START> i have never before seen a movie quite like this nor as funny i laughed my goddamned ass off and have watched it repetitively infact i am watching it now chad from is hot too anyway if you never liked it blow it out your ass you have no taste the movie involves ry ryan dunn having just broke up with his girlfriend turning to bam and falcone brandon for help in finding out exactly what she done with hellboy rake and with the help of chris himself they do just that br br the fender bender scene and the scene with cactus at record bin were hilarious
<START> at one time buddy cop' movies ruled the box office it seemed that every summer flocks of beverly hills cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters not any more lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle the drought has eased a bit recently with the release of showtime a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre br br mitch preston is a dedicated cop he's not a dirty harry type by any means he's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his say a t v cameraman mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of chase a producer looking for a killer hook for her reality t v ' cop show she thinks that mitch will give her the boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself enter trey sellars a patrolman cum actor who's watched way too many police story re runs of course mitch and trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues br br we know that mitch and trey are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie that's the way buddy cop movies are suppose to work in fact it has to be said that showtime rarely deviates from the time honored clichÃ©s as writ by lethal weapon and tango cash there's a high tech mcguffin to get the ball rolling in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks there's a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin there are chases shootouts and explosions we all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it's all going to turn out you know what there's nothing wrong with that yes we know the well worn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip not the destination showtime doesn't strain to be original instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations as a result showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy br br robert de niro is dryly funny as mitch in the past i've thought de niro to be a cold and actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy lately though he's grown on me he seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles eddie murphy is hilarious as trey the best way to describe his performance is that trey is what murphy would be if murphy weren't so talented and hadn't hit the big time rene russo has a droll time playing motor mouthed show biz shark chase she stalks through the movie chasing high nielson ratings with awe inspiring determination in her zeal she re vamps mitch's life to make it more camera friendly she even calls upon t j hooker himself william shatner to show mitch how be a more cop shatner is funny playing himself precisely as we expect him to be loud oblivious and slightly obnoxious br br i have to admit i was really looking forward to showtime and i wasn't disappointed ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit today it's doing moderate business at best that's a pity because showtime is a whole lot of fun
<START> i've been hearing a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in south east asia over the last three years apparently it's on the hold of mutating into something very contagious and millions upon millions of people are going to be wiped out in a global pandemic just thought i'd mention this in case you haven't got round to writing your will yet br br i'd also thought i'd mention it since i was watching something called carriers tonight which wasn't about naval warfare but opens with a scene that's a cross between outbreak and an episode of the x files i saw many years ago i thought i'd be watching something with added resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu but after the not unimpressive opening carriers descends into a cheap and cheerful tvm and like every other tvm you'll see the lead characters are female one of which is a ballsy authority figure while the other lead female is a mother of young children it goes without saying there's a sick child subplot too br br what is irritating about the tvm format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could have been quite a good film if it was made for cinema there's a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive jay walker getting run down stunt but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into family sentiment since this and just about every other tvm ever made was made for an essentially female audience
<START> this is a beautiful yet simple movie about one man driven to find an answer an answer he doesn't necessarily need but has structured his whole life around it is heartrending it is hilarious it is glorious it is tormenting it is delicate and dynamic i say it's genius br br i have read jonathan safran book everything is illuminated mainly because i heard elijah wood was starring in the movie adaptation and i was just enraptured by the characters i laughed out loud more than once and every time someone talks about what it's about i hear the same hackneyed response almost like it's one big long word yet this story is so philosophical it goes deeper than that that conversation about the ring and in case it really gets one thinking suddenly this story merges from a simple quest to an inner metamorphosis and i find myself looking at things a bit differently now br br i recommend renting this before if ever reading it because the book had many obscene downright perverted stories that were not included in the movie mainly the history of jonathan's family that was not necessary for the film br br a bit of trivia i heard is that wood's current girlfriend has a cameo in this flick as the drummer in the band that alex arranges to perform as jonathan steps off the train into ukraine br br you spend half of the movie trying to figure out what it's about exactly and what jonathan is about because his character is so withdrawn like a turtle in a shell br br it is magnificent and in my opinion one of elijah wood's best movies
<START> little quentin seems to have mastered the art of having the cake and eating it br br as usual the pure sadistic display can be explained as a clever thought provoking way of sending violence back into the audience's face br br sure mr tarantino violence is baaad sadism is baaad it is well worth wading in it to make that point how very brilliant br br the juvenile part of the audience may well not be clever enough to follow all the smart references to higher levels of consciousness though but i'm confident they'll see the light one day br br thanks for making this little world of ours a little better you deserve a medal
<START> steven segal has done some awful films but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago the cast is better than usual and while the story and the plot are a total joke at least most of the action scenes look pretty good br br the plot is probably one of the worst in film history someone is being executed because he stole some money some mercenary types kidnap a supreme court justice their goal is to exchange the judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money meanwhile the execution chamber is full of trap doors and false floors and looks like a set from one of the du soleil circus shows br br then there is the issue of the prison here the warden is a played by tony plana the prisoners all have their gang colors and signs and the guards are there to serve the meals and keep the prison clean nothing like a bunch of prisoners fighting and beating up some guards while the warden is watching what happens the warden gives them a stern talking to he might punish them next time br br there are a lot of moments in this movie that are good for laughs however peeples looks pretty good and ja rule tries to be an action hero lots of fun watching the prisoners all do the right thing and get armed so that they can free the supreme court justice from her captors regardless of how bad half past dead may be when you watch it keep in mind that it is easily the best movie that steven segal has starred in since under siege in 1992
<START> the most beautiful film if one is looking for serious depth meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie excellent performances by the whole cast even more beautiful than a beautiful mind itself simply awesome i wish this movie entered the oscars i cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character the most beautiful film if one is looking for serious depth meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie excellent performances by the whole cast even more beautiful than a beautiful mind itself simply awesome i wish this movie entered the oscars i cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character
