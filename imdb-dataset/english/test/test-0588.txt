<START> what can i say about this film that won't give you any preconceived notions when you see it very little the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down what follows after that is the movie it is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended it is not a perfect film the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story even more confused if you've read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere you'll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on i'm not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have if you like horror and don't mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl
<START> sebastian cabot is a rich jerk who wants to buy up all the land because there is oil though none of the locals are aware of the oil with the help of an evil gunfighter in black they kill and terrorize everyone when the son of a murdered man arrives he refuses to back down and stands up to these forces of darkness br br wow as i watched terror in a texas town i felt as if i'd seen this film many times before and would probably see something like it again that's because aside from a few novelties such as sterling hayden using a harpoon on the bad guy it has a plot that is too familiar once again we've got a rich guy who is trying to drive out all the farmers in order to gain control of all the land and to do so he's brought in hired guns to force people to sell or kill them been there done that in just too many films br br i love sterling hayden in films but just couldn't recommend this as anything other than a poor time passer

<START> my friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of the only good that came from it was this movie take it to limit right as the movie started we could tell we were in for a true classic the music is probably done by rural white boys from colorado but it sounds just like early 90's rap the star of the show actor leo fitzpatrick plays the bad boy so well especially sporting a big zit the entire movie this movie is based on climbing and i'm not a climber yet even i think it's hilarious when they have the climber struggling to climb and there's a guy in the background who is basically walking up the you don't want to miss this movie you'll get to see the same clips over and over again you'll get surprises at every turn you'll find yourself quoting the unforgettable lines i highly recommend this movie to anyone take it snow disclaimer this movie is poorly done but that is what makes it great
<START> considering the filmâs reputation as truly the worst of the worst i was looking forward to watching opus my word itâs not necessarily any more inept than the other woods iâve watched â however being from the reefer madness 1938 school of film making glen or glenda doesnât come across as readily as his genre efforts br br also this surely emerges as horror legend bela nadir his first of three with the director one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was considering the history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo besides idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward script is mostly to blame for this â given the impossible dialogue with repeated nonsensical allusions to dog and fat he handed the ailing star by the way wood himself plays the central role under the pseudonym daniel davis â and being just as worthless in this area proves to have been an all round dog dolores fuller â his wife and co star â was similarly untalented she would also appear in jail bait 1954 at the very least the image where the latter finally lets glen wear her angora sweater did give tim affectionate biopic ed wood 1994 its famous poster br br incidentally the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between wood and orson welles â well for all intents and purposes glen or glenda constitutes ed citizen kane 1941 given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques in fact the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore many of it irrelevant such as the bewildering instances of s m and inane dream sequences highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make martin scorsese weep with envy the filmâs sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction phenomenon of transvestism is however sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach br br for what itâs worth the edition i watched was the re issue which included six minutes of footage directed by w merle censored on original release furthermore my copy went out of synch every so often which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track â though thankfully this was the fault of the source conversion to divx as opposed to the film itself
<START> as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism after all fun with dick and jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another carey success after the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in the idea that a charming charismatic top v i p employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible the actors seem confused with the situation as well of course the stereotypical rich uncaring head of the operation doesn't struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder one minute dick is seen as a cocky office pro obsessed with possessions the next minute he's a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able quite happily to put a gun to another man's head jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going br br the idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work the odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality carey shines when he is presented with a strong daring character man on the moon the truman show ace ventura which this film never presented him with despite its best efforts
<START> okay i sensed that a film by mormons about mormons for mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen but little did i know how so very painful it would be a little known fact is that mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films the church's official cinematic campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the mormon community including the wonderful short film cipher in the snow which ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 70's then there's neil labute's disturbingly masterful ouvre br br however the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they didn't focus on mormons or any specific mormon theology instead they opt to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level god's army abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the stilted and myopic world of the orthodox while this might be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted mormon director richard ineptitude as a filmmaker and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge god's army unwatchable by almost any standard br br own appallingly wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting mormons you're ever likely to meet of course the cast's sorry performances aren't helped any by pathetic script he should be given credit for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the church but as can be expected he conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light it should also come as no surprise that most of the answers to the church's darker side are addressed with little other than faith at one point an african american missionary is scolded by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated up until 1978 some ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the deep south had already done so instead of addressing the church's actively racist history perhaps the spot in mormon theology which even church leaders don't defend anymore troubled character instead ponders joseph smith's murder an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching top off this milktoast with third grader leper jokes passing as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent films br br if you knew little about mormons before watching this film you might become prone to avoiding them at all costs if you are mormon this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud about
<START> quite possibly one of if not the worst film ever conceived cast and acted in the history of cinema who on god's green earth would ever think to cast cameron diaz and james as a couple she looked like his mother god forgive me but i am just being honest and that was the least of the many problems plaguing this horrible excuse for a film it was a horrible statement against women but at least if you're gonna blame women for the problems of the world tell a decent story not one with so many annoying loop holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and thrills everybody should get their money back who went to see it in theaters or bought the dvd
<START> tough luck follows a homeless drifter as he becomes entangled in the underground crime world of deception and chaos archie norman reedus has been released from prison and has nothing to lose he is almost killed before the owner of a carnival named ike armand assante hires him for work soon ike discloses a strong desire for archie to murder his mischievous wife an erotic dancer for the carnival things soon get complicated when archie falls in love with and warns her of the scheme they become involved in a very steamy affair that leaves little to the imagination of the viewer after which they soon make a plan together they plot to murder ike but things don't go quite as planned br br i would be lying if i said that this film didn't surprise me i was personally blown away by how good this film was upon renting it several years back i was expecting another clichÃ© thriller with a lot of the typical elements and themes that are shown in a lot of films of that type these days within minutes i was hooked and found myself quite involved with the world of this film it's the kind of film much like buffalo '66 that just sucks you in and transports you into the style and the feeling of paranoia it is a film that really pulls it off in stunning fashion one thing i particularly appreciated was how the film depicted it's characters the film isn't as easy and clear cut as it may appear in the plot summary these are characters that you actually grow to care about and are fascinated by including the characters that are supposed to be the bad guys in truth there are no good guys or bad guys in this film all of the characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly true to life there aren't many films that manage to accomplish this task as flawlessly as this film does but it's definitely a film style that i like and i want to see more of from films today there were quite a few crime films that were like that back in the early 50s but there hasn't been one as gripping and unique as this ever since br br in terms of flaws i have mostly very minor gripes the film itself isn't exactly original however i doubt that most folks would expect it to be original the film's editing style also may be irritating to some folks as it tends to have a camcorder type of shaky cam throughout while i wasn't bothered by it and actually felt that it added to the atmosphere i'm sure most viewers will not be as enthralled by it and may find it generally off putting despite the minor flaws however this is one of the most underrated films of the 2000s it's so refreshing to get lucky and watch an unknown film that turns out to be good it seems as if this film was a direct to video release though this film is far better than that had it been put in theaters it wouldn't have won any awards nor would it have been seen much but it would have a lot more recognition than it has today recognition that this film deserves tough luck is an astounding entertaining and twisted neo noir thriller with a real sense of class and style juxtapose and with enough substance to make the average moviegoer more than simply satisfied
<START> no one can argue with it this is and will be the best movie ever as it is the perfect definition of what any movie should be a collective hypnosis beyond times no movie can give you more perfectly this impression that you carried it inside you even before you saw it for the first time br br there are images that stay forever
<START> slight spoilers this installment of the full moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements first off a new puppet master is established secondly the puppets turn good in this sequel finally it introduces some scifi fantasy elements as well br br a new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay his girlfriend her psychic friend and that psychics boyfriend stumble upon andre toulon's puppet trunk they also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animating the so the demon sends the totems a bunch of craven little creatures that look like ear less gremlins then it's up to the puppet troupe to take care of the inter dimensional threat that's trying to kill there new friends br br like most low budget movies this film is rife with continuity problems how did the puppets get put back in the trunk how come nobody remembers the last rasche of in the hotel who bought the hotel why would a contractor by a building with a history of mass murders all this and many more questions will not be answered ever br br the real suprise of this movie is the acting it's actually pretty good the actors take it with a enthusiasm unusual especially for a bunch of full moon teresa hill was especially impressive as the shy nervous psychic lauren chandra west susie was also a pleasant suprise also gordon hill was a tolerable protagonist but cameron was far too annoying to stomach thank the norse god he dies before halfway through br br the puppets are there usual animated selves with some improvements as well there emotions especially jester's are much more human due to the sounds that have been given to them blade's hisses grunts and six snicker have all been improved and sound much better the stop motion animation is only average at best especially the totems they just don't seem to move as fluidly as the previous installment in the series also the costume is absolutely how are we supposed to afraid of a creature so humorous looking br br the story seems a bit for the series i think charlie band was looking to focus in on a younger demographic the violence being toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same gore fans will be disappointed br br i think the above is the main problem this movie can't really stick with many people it doesn't have the violence for the language is a little cleaner yet it's too violent and harsh for the wee ones which is why the movie gets low ratings i have to say that the common reviews are mostly fair
<START> this is so embarrassing it's a remake of the wedding singer which happens to be my favorite movie which gives me another reason to disapprove of this film it has the same plot same jokes same characters jeez people need to be more original
<START> and it's a not very good documentary either american movie seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary mockumentary and even some newspaper tv listings described it as such i'll not laugh out loud at that because it's easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala this is spinal tap br br what seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker mark who is how can i put it rather self deluded yes but that's not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we'd all still be living in caves and the fact that mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both sam raimi yes that one and peter jackson yes that one both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it's not a criticism no it's just that mark yes that one is a parody of american trailer trash br br remember in there's something about mary ben stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker come into my office because you're f in' fired well that's who mark resembles along with most of jerry springer's guests so it's very easy to see why some people thought this wasn't a real documentary it's also not a very good documentary since mark and co give me the creeps did you know that someone thought mark would grow up to be a serial killer does anyone else think there's plenty of time left for this to happen
<START> rented this out from my local because it was the only new british film available this week never heard of the film maker before or his other films thank you imdb about time some one made a good young british comedy that didn't star hugh grant or forty something's the story is a morality tale but never preachy throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast luke cameo was surprisingly very good but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in loved the colour grading especially in the night club sequences great music and a truly original voice at work here nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge
<START> fast times it ain't but check this movie out it has a heart pour yourself a drink and enjoy it's loaded with a slew of just beginning stars fenn has her first on screen credited cameo chris penn lea thompson eric stotz jenny wright rick moranis etc they all look so young oh and if you look closely the cop's wife is nancy wilson from the rock band heart
