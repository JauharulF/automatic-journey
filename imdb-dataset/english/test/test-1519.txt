<START> finally a good movie made on the most demented serial killer in history for those less familiar with ed gein he was basically the madman who was known for grave robbing and skinning his victims which most horror fans ripped off shot in a period style that reflects the bleak plains of wisconsin perfectly this is easily the most atmospheric horror film yet to depict gein and his gruesome killings kane hodder jason from friday the 13th series and michael berryman hills have eyes i ii deliver chilling performances in this serial killer opus that easily leaves behind the lackluster former gein attempts so far i'd say this is one of the better horror films released this year 0
<START> if you love vampire lore and are a fan of gothic horror then you might want to check out midnight i did not know much about this movie before i watched it and i wasn't expecting much but i found the movie to be fun and entertaining br br starring armand assante as the leader of the vampires simon separates itself from other low budget vampire flicks by weaving in the mythology of st george and the dragon in a fun new way br br i'm not sure what the budget for this movie was but i sense that if it was a little more then they might have really been able to hit home the gore and effects br br if you're up late one night and you're in the mood for a fun low budget vampire flick then midnight is a good choice
<START> and a hard spot somewhere else i haven't seen this movie since i was quite young maybe 12 or 13 who knows but what i do know is this is the movie that taught me how to masturbate i kid you not i have no idea if it is any good by any real standards of today but for me back then it was everything br br the only reason i feel comfortable writing this is because i'm sure no one will ever get around to reading it i mean really who is going to look up this movie these days br br i just discovered that i have not yet used up the ten line minimum for the amount of length i most take up in a review i had no idea there was such a minimum length but there i go like a student trying to fill up a page in a journal my ten lines thank you very much
<START> possibly the worst movie i ever saw the person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light you can't see anything in this movie it is way to dark the parts where you can see something the camera is directed straight at a light source so you get big lens flares so you still can't see this movie should have been a radio play or something some parts of the movie are actually edited upside down for some kind of crap effect low budget movies can be done so much better then this and low budget is no excuse for this an editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that you couldn't see anything maybe the makers should have spend some of their low budget on a preview monitor so they could see what they shot the only good thing about this movie being so dark is that you can't see the awful acting it also covers up the crappy sfx people at beginner film schools make better movies then this movies shot with handy cams look better then this
<START> why is it that in the '50s and '60s italians made so of the best movies and then during the '70s and '80s made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies probably because art films didn't make any money the cannibal movie unlike the zombie movie which was created by americans and by italians is a purely italian creation designed as a mondo exploitation showcase and to make as much money as possible no artistic integrity getting in the way here eaten alive came during the cannibal movie heyday the director umberto hadn't even hit his stride yet his genre classic cannibal ferox was still a year away br br in plotting similar to read ripped off from ruggero deodato's seminal cannibal classic cannibal holocaust a woman janet receives word from the police that they've received a 8mm film from her sister she's gone missing in africa and it's suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it mel ferrer as a professor of tells her that a man named jonas ivan rassimov has started a jonestown like cult in new guinea and that's where the sister is the woman hires a guide robert to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister and wouldn't you know it the jungle is full of cannibals br br one sentence should sum it up if you've seen on cannibal movie you've seen them all mostly because these films steal shamelessly from each other copied cannibal holocaust to make this film and retooled this to make cannibal ferox deodato copied parts of this for hit and run and because they all share the same material they all feature the same traits awful photography boring scenery terrible dubbing overacting and exploitation exploitation exploitation genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran rassimov and have a scenery eating contest exists solely to be naked raped or in peril plenty o' gore for all the sickos out there the cannibals who do actually appear to be native cannibals eat lunch met disguised as human flesh and in the grand tradition of cannibal movies any live animal shown onscreen is usually killed shortly thereafter overall really not a good experience but i'm sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excrement entertaining i know i did
<START> the andrew davies adaptation of the sarah waters' novel was excellent the characters of nan and and kitty were superbly portrayed by rachael stirling and kelley hawes respectively the whole series was a total joy to watch it caught the imagination of everyone across the board whether straight or gay i wish there could be a sequel
<START> one of the most notorious of the banned video nasties of the 1980s is also one of the most excessively over hyped make them die slowly is about what you'd expect from an umberto directed jungle yet poorly rendered native torture techniques some ridiculous social commentary yes even sillier than cannibal holocaust and lots of guts being chewed the film's exploitative violence though is often only shown in brief close up and never dwelt on for very long which diminishes its effect interpret that how you may the dialog is lenzi's usual silliness as our male heroes show their affection for females by calling them tw t and the like the cast of familiar faces including lorraine de giovanni lombardo and robert does their best in the face of the escalating idiocy including a completely ludicrous castration preservation but cannot save this overworked lousy effort
<START> a great performance by emily grace i stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider i was high entertained and had much compassion for the character alice played by emily grace the story had me guessing in what would happen to alice and was not predicable the overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters the ending of the story ended on a rather fair way i will purchase this dvd to add to my library i am a new fan of emily grace and i high anticipate in seeing more from her performances
<START> this was the worst movie i have ever seen i have to admit i didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining br br the 'star' was the most unpleasant character i've ever seen neither funny nor attractive in fact creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary br br it is painful to watch there is no acting especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors br br as horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors watching a puerto rican one is even worse br br the name of the movie is descriptive he is the pest this movie is a must miss
<START> i put this movie on not expecting much other than a b movie gore fest thankfully i was presented with a very well made film that built up the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its run time this was an impressive achievement the acting was solid creating characters that you cared about and related to and although some may find the film slow it did force you to think about what you would have done in the same situation added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably an excellent effort then that is well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense over gore
<START> i remember when this film came out and watched it a few times on vhs i was so glad when it was finally released on dvd i was hoping for widescreen but at the point would take what was available i love how they used color in the film the outdoor scenes are so alive with color the trees are the i've ever seen most of the film was shot in minnesota a beautiful town located on the st croix river they must have really scouted locations for filming because they did a great job the story is well written and directed i would rate this as one of peter horton's best i'm also surprised that andrew the director of photography hasn't done more he did an incredible job the acting also rates up there it's amazing to see two actors of such a young age pull off this type of film annabella sciorra did a great job as dexter's mother who wouldn't want her as a mother
<START> john landis truly outdid himself when he directed michael jackson's thriller as a short film of course it's corny the dialogue is terrible and it all seems way too cheesy but it's perfect none the less br br michael and his date are out at the cinema to view the latest horror flick when it all gets a little too graphic for the date she leaves michael follows on the way home they decide to take a shortcut through the local graveyard there it begins br br the actual thriller dance is amazing it's full of those trademark jackson moves as well as some memorable zombie moves too it doesn't appear rushed at all nor too long the whole thing seems movie like and it really is actually rather scary of course it's one of the most famous music videos of all time and is probably the greatest music video ever made as well br br overall watch it seriously those 13 minutes will be some of the best ever spent staring at a screen 5 5
<START> well it's safe to say that subconscious cruelty is one weird film supposedly an insight into the human mind subconscious cruelty is comprises four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme the first segment entitled is really just a warm up but it's good in that it gives the viewer an idea of what to expect from the next three segments it simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table while another woman cuts into her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball i've got no idea what the point is but it certainly makes for visceral viewing the following story is the best of the bunch and takes in the old favourite sick movie theme of incest the segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister he's repulsed by her pregnancy yet he wants to have sex with her anyway and naturally he gets his way this story stands out because of the monotonous and of narration as well as the ending which doesn't fail to deliver the shocks this segment is well acted well filmed and easily the highlight of subconscious cruelty br br naturally the next two sections aren't as good as the second one so the only way from there is down but director still manages to pull something out of the bag before the film ends he doesn't do it right away however as the third segment is the weakest of the film and simply sees a lot of people have sex with the ground it's very surreal and therefore memorable for that same reason but there doesn't seem to be a lot of point to it and i was in the mood for something a bit more morbid after the second section the film ends on a high however as while i'm not entirely sure what the point was the final segment features the film's best imagery this segment focuses on religion and certainly isn't for anyone that values it director has achieved something here as while this collection of four 'extreme' stories doesn't come together as a complete whole the film almost feels tasteful as it's shot in such an eloquent and eye catching manner the director would seem to have been imitating the highly respected surreal director luis buÃ±uel albeit with gore rape and incest and if you ask me he hasn't done a bad job at all not for everyone but certainly worth a look for extreme fanatics
<START> when the opening shot is u s marines seriously disrespecting the u s flag a movie has a tough road ahead but unfortunately it was downhill from there there is a military adviser credited who is also apparently a retired u s marine making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol and law went unnoticed even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a marine is reported kia then buried in very short order without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body or if there even was a body the u s government is still finding the missing from wwii and it takes months to identify the remains military shot down remain mia for months or years and are only declared kia when the remains have been positively identified or after years of red tape here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks maybe this happens in denmark but not in the u s clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with or respect for the u s military br br beyond that there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere there must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash having a script that worked might have helped but this one seems to have been made up on the spot working from cliffs notes there's no way to know if the script was this awful originally or if it was the auteur or the middle management kids at the studio who bear responsibility either way this is an awful movie that should have never been made
<START> this movie is not about the soda nor is it quite the french connection br br the seven ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in accordance with protocol of the nypd scheider heads the group with his posse or regular looking joes they are running surveillance on a local cartel and things go awry when a cop's wire is found out br br meanwhile richard lynch the most evil looking man in film invasion america little nikita and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and escape from scheider in the coolest chase scene i've seen bullitt and french connection are not as good as they one up the west side to the george washington and onto the palisades in new jersey br br the stunt drivers are terrific and lynch makes it away free though he looks scared witless from the dangerous trip roy scheider is nearly killed when his car slams into the abutted rear of mack truck ripping the roof of his vehicle off br br things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence quick moving and intense fresh for a thirty years
