<START> this review is in response to the submission wondering how factually correct the movie was br br saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants like my italian grandparents who came through ellis island at the turn of the last century would subject themselves to all manner of invasive inspection just to enter america br br it was certainly eye opening since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while there my grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived br br i just returned from a trip to new york where i had the pleasure of visiting ellis island and the museum actually walks you through the immigration evaluation process the filmmaker obviously did his research right down to the medical exams and equipment questions and puzzles they are all there at the museum even the wedding pictures and the review board room factually correct anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie inspirational to say the least
<START> this is a disgrace to the name of all of the lovable and laughable saga why do the writers feel the need to make the movie unbearable to watch by all quality standards the critters are cute and adorable as ever but deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a killer baby they aren't as terrifying gruesome some what spine chilling and funny as they were portrayed in the movies before i used to love their porcupine shots but now it is hidden as if it was thought to be repetitive and boring and what is with the killing and not eating i thought this movie would have been cool but everything was so wrong why did ug have to be evil and killed by that which is known as charlie this movie sickens me disgrace disgrace
<START> ok number one this film is a 90's version of a crappy show from the 70's that no one remembers number two as soon as the movie started i was confused it was like i walked in halfway through the movie there was no plot it was very annoying horrible wardrobe call me crazy but it's just not believable to me that little skinny omar epps can chase down a big grown man without a gun and scare him into talking it's a ridiculous plot i'm sorry but to me kids these days can't even put their pants on one leg at a time let alone catch some evil underground killers i walked out of the theater and demanded and got my money back i do not reccomend this movie to anyone over 12 years old
<START> slipknot is a heavy metal band from the great city of des moines iowa in which the rockers wear their own distinguished mask i know someone already said this but i need to fill up space for this review the band members are joey mick sid clown james corey chris and paul this band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by everyone that loves hardcore rock another good movie is called which shows the band's performance at the london arena the my plague video was shot there and is included on the dvd the most kick ass song they made is also on there sic so if you love the band you need to see this and if you love heavy metal music then you have to hear this band
<START> an hulking alien beastie crash lands on earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off that is when his aim isn't terribly off and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen br br all in all it's pretty silly stuff i do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times i actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects however it doesn't help when the monster provides the movie's only truly entertaining moments and he isn't on screen for a large portion of the film's running time the acting throughout this is just plain awful and amateurish and our lead hero sheriff cinder is much too unattractive to be bagging the film's hottest chick i also have to take off points for blatantly copying the thing from another world 1951 on several occasions when the monster isn't on a rampage is far too dull and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable even they become less fun watch this one back to back with the 1951 thing and see the difference characterization attention to plot and detail and creating suspense makes to a monster on the loose movie
<START> a stunningly beautiful charlotte lewis stars as a woman who is terrorized by a ghosts who torment her on the phone driven to the edge in terror charlotte is forced to confront this chilling mystery in order to save her sanity and her life i can't believe that ruggero deodato the director behind mondo cannibale cannibal holocaust and house on the edge of the park directed this absurd piece of trash admittedly the music by goblin front man claudio is pretty good but the story is painfully stupid the script by franco is ridiculous and it makes no sense the acting is bad and there is absolutely no suspense the scene in which a prospective rapist of charlotte lewis is killed by coins ejected from a subway telephone is more than laughable don't waste your time with this piece of crap there are far better italian horror movies out there
<START> i completely forgot that i'd seen this within a couple of days which is pretty revealing in itself the umpteenth version of gaston 'phantom of the opera' locked door country house mystery i had heard that it was an engaging and witty update so it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfying br br as a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally by the audience like the worst agatha it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been privy to as a film be it comedy or thriller the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost non existent with the exception of the killer everyone is a face value version of the typical suspects in the typical country house murder story reporter endangered heiress suspicious fiancÃ© scatterbrained scientist father a surprisingly poor michel etc there's no depth and little of interest and the frequently over ripe or misjudged performances don't help you frankly don't care about anyone in it so there's no jeopardy or suspense only claude rich and in the last reel pierre arditi get anything to work with and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective br br for the rest we get endless exposition and a couple of ineffective would be comic set pieces a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off with dennis reduced to irving the for the last third of the picture i'm not fond of country house movies or agatha christie style so those who are might it a lot more slack but i found it a poor show as rich says when the mystery is revealed it's all rather something of a disappointment
<START> excerpt from tv guide br br this week on the love boat captain has his hands full when a gets on board with an unexpected cargo join the captain isaac gopher and julie in a fun filled halloween special guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the br br this is typical lame sci fi channel cut rate fare the captain of a cruise ship played by the once respectable john rhys davies is in charge of a carnival cruise along the coast of mexico his daughter is along for the ride and she's earning her keep by being the ship's kickboxing instructor pay attention everyone that kickboxing will come in handy later it should be noted that the captain's daughter is pretty uncoordinated and painful to watch it would have been good if she might have taken a couple of kickboxing classes before trying to play an instructor in a movie br br captain stupid and his daughter join mrs howell from gilligan's island a kooky and a dark mysterious stranger on this 90 minute ride into boredom br br that's right i said he keeps mentioning that he brought some precious cargo on board that he needs to check out needless to say the box contains a that somebody decides to let out from this point on a man in the rubber suit runs around the ship killing people captain stupid is powerless to stop it he decides to call in the marines but telling them that there are a bunch of terrorists on his ship br br the marines respond they say all that marine speak stuff like and get some but those silly marines are no match for a they don't really tell anyone where they're going either so there's no help in sight i guess no one will really miss some lame battalion of lost marines but don't forget captain daughter is thankfully a kickboxing instructor yay for little stupid she comes in right in the nick of time she beats up the bloodthirsty goat sucker and saves the day means goat sucker therefore suck but there's no way that suck anywhere near as much as this movie
<START> i think did her evil part very well she should have won an award anything that dunne is in is salvageable because dunne is a great actress and can pull anything off even a weak script therefore i would recommend it for this reason alone this movie may have been a little ahead of it's time the plot might be more acceptable these days br br during the golden age of hollywood movies were meant to entertain or teach mostly to make us feel good or cope with the times this plot seem to deviate from that profile yet again i must say what ever irene dunne was in at least was good because she made things so believable the only other actress i can say made me think this way was maybe deborah kerr watch silver cord if you get the chance for the acting if nothing else
<START> this flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of k gordon murray that's because it was easy to find it was on every public domain label in the vhs era and before that a late night t v cult classic double knee thigh slapper besides how do you resist the title br br for late comers a brief explanation of it's merit florida wheeler dealer k gordon murray imported mexican horror films dubbed them into english then made a mint with them at the drive in the mexican originals were weird enough to begin with american boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded great great set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects nothing in hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange now mix in catholic influenced social conventions mexican folk lore and we are not in kansas anymore br br add to that the english scripts they were dubbed into most were written by who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips on screen not the literal translation as a result the american soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy there's even a fan web site for murray that prints the best most over the top lines for each movie first time viewers to the films complain about the pacing the purple prose the production values and are told it's supposed to be that way while the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws it all must be very confusing if you don't have a taste for it br br this one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series the aztec mummy and curse of the aztec mummy all three are now available on the 3 disc aztec mummy collection bci and it's about time it has the k gordon murray version on one side the original mexican production on the other side the contrast between the two is fascinating a lot of the times the original spanish is not much saner br br robot mummy starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes sort of continuity was tossed out the window in number two and it's downhill from there logic wise you don't even get the angel back or any mention of him in this final episode names places even family trees switch between films after a while you start looking for the continuity changes br br by now the series villain doc is totally pig biting mad nearly drooling with dementia and still wants to steal the aztec arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the aztec mummy floor show and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone again the mummy isn't any happier with this then he was last time br br the robot actually has a production credit it was made by co s a ' i mention this because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout nope br br this was planned br br wait until you see the controller it runs from x box where were you when needed you the robot looks crushed to death at the end but actually came back in two more mexican made movies it had a fan base br br all in all a funny quirky finish to a three movie series sit back and enjoy
<START> pretty decent for his early work and no without it and gets an 2 points extra for the easter eggs for shirow definitely a rung in the ladder i am biased as a shirow fan but this was a big step from dirty pair which was what i knew of him violent fun with a porno soundtrack you cannot help but notice that i know people appreciate him for ghost in the shell but all of the deep spiritual overtones were dealt with in killing terrorists the struggle for humans to stay viable as phase them out and staying thin despite her intake of junk food definitely like the characters even the traitor and i do not know why
<START> it seems like an exciting prospect a modern dress othello with christopher eccleston who was so frighteningly good in shallow grave and especially jude and eamonn walker who brought such intensity and introspection to his pivotal role on oz one would think them both natural shakespeareans but both performers misfire walker's othello is a fairly cookie cutter take on the part with a whispery delivery that doesn't make much of an impact and eccleston hams it up appallingly as iago winking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the role it's likely he was egged on by his director whose florid approach might have worked better with elizabethan language but who seems a jarring pretentious choice for this modernized screenplay and the screenplay itself is less disappointing in being modern than it is in being obvious Â it's as if andrew davies sketched out the famous plot and then just wrote whatever dialogue first popped into his head all in all a failure 4 out of 10
<START> i had such high hopes for retro to air this but instead of having shows such as this ones that don't get the treatment that they deserve they air things that i may have seen dozens of times before br br the was the highlight of my pre teen years i know that may seem a little bit clichÃ©d but it's true after duke from g i joe jake is another one of those cartoon characters that i really had a crush on br br it's too bad that retro doesn't see it the same way people of my generation do otherwise retro would be a lot better than it is
<START> saw this film when it was an entry in santa fe film festival heavy film depiction of a completely dysfunctional family taken to another level of the extreme might have left me depressed to the extreme had it not been for very funny sight gags and dialogue along the way which lightened the film's overall tone the relatively uplifting ending gave hope for those affected by the initial tragedy still i did not walk out of the theatre ready to go to a fun party the film stayed with me for several days br br brought back memories of ordinary people but with humor mixed in with the tragedy i thought the acting was excellent especially by sigourney weaver and emile how each character dealt with the tragedy was at times sad self defeating but also at times hilarious clever dialogue and situations
<START> i can't say i enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt a little slighted but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and i was interested to find out that the are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and i'm only saying this in comparison and it wasn't worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal br br though i enjoyed the previous work i've never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn i guess that's why i didn't feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i don't mean to offend any of your people i'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a bronx tale when you live in the city all your life it's hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooney who i assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect storm naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of it br br though i don't normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song br br overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesn't have that in your face quality that the have shown to us in the past it's a slighter effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out br br my score 7 out of 10
