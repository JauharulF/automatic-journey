<START> in the history of cinema every great film maker had to create a first film many times when viewed after they have become a success a light bulb goes on in our heads the connection is made and we see the solid foundation from where they started so it is with horses on mars it is the subtle humor woven around a seemingly straight forward narrative that tells a great story but allows you to enjoy the visuals at the same time in the imagery i found great attention to detail and a production polish that is rare in any student film br br a young film maker always has improvements to be made but if mr anderson continues on this path i think we will someday look back on this film as the beginning a great career br br you should definitely view this film nothing beats the grandeur of the big screen
<START> truly a wonderful movie bruce willis gives his always outstanding comedic romantic acting power to this message movie and the movie brings hope to the losers many of us know we are a gift to everyone of middle age whose spent time seems both full and yet empty there is more around the next bend and it can be great enriching and romantic leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past and then take off on a favorite flight to your better future if we could re live our youthful experiences if we could really remember the events that shaped us wouldn't we find a special kind of freedom see the movie open the gift
<START> i had high hopes for this production being one of my favourite works br br indeed a lot of it is reasonable helen is not a bad lady macbeth but lacks the devilry which the original character is infused with many of the minor characters do well and the scottish settings are superb br br the big disappointment to me is jason connery in the title role he seems to be reading his lines off a cue card with the wrong glasses surely for the first time as well he can do so much better any production when compared to the sublime ian mckellen macbeth 1979 who to my mind gave the gold standard performance is going to struggle to be appreciated but i actually fell asleep and had to rewind this one before i could get through it hardly a great sign br br honestly one to avoid
<START> i am so disappointed in this movie i can't express it i was so excited when i started watching this film to see mickey rourke all leather faced and that kid from third rock from the sun acting like i psycho i thought wow this is going to be a winner freakin' natural born killers style and it got better the production value was great the directing was great the acting was great the cinematography was great and the plot was well the plot well what what plot about half way through this film i was pulling my hair out yelling what the hell is going on and i mean that quite literally nothing makes any sense whatsoever nothing nothing nothing
<START> this really is a great film full of love and humor it compels the audience to really care about the characters and participate in their journey michael managed to assemble a great cast of top players a minor miracle for a first film no doubt they were moved to help him tell this beautiful story david carries the film with his understated intensity and honesty natasha is unpredictable exasperating and yet totally lovable as grace also a great turn by karen black great to see her on the screen again as grace's crazed but sympathetic mother there is cutting wit throughout allowing us the relief of laughter when faced with life's pain the acting is impeccable the editing tight the direction inspired and the music creates a fitting backdrop of mood given the present day hollywood blockbuster craze full of big budgets big names car crashes and special effects 'max grace' is a refreshing departure give yourself a treat and see this movie
<START> is a b movie at best and at worst is more of a disaster that what it's supposed to be depicting to be fair you have to be prepared in any movie to suspend disbelief for one major concept asks you to suspend disbelief in science human interaction and common sense br br tommy lee jones gets to be the studly yet 1990s sensitive head honcho of the office of emergency management and he's fine when he's not stuck with the stupid dialogue the script provides however anne heche gives a howlingly bad performance as a smart ass geologist who becomes love interest while the city is burning down natch gaby hoffman goes from field of dreams and american president to a turn as a whimpering needy and victim for life daughter of jones don cheadle gets to sit in a really office and take jones's phone calls doing the job that in reality would and should be doing br br anyway the movie really starts going downhill when geology partner gets sucked into a lava vent while they're breaking into the subway lines it picks up speed when jones starts suggesting that they use buses to dam the flow of the lava flowing down the street geologist who loves to lecture everyone about the science of geology being apparently oblivious to the fact that lava is hot and it melts metal and rock and a dead bus is unlikely to have much effect it really starts to suck when the film introduces rodney king like racial tension between two bad actors dressed as cops and an angry black man who can't understand why the fire department is busy with this large river of flowing lava but hey in the end the three of them will be working together to build a k rail dam to stop the lava from eating up his neighborhood even though the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used wouldn't stop lava anyway besides k rails are hardly watertight but i guess lava wouldn't think to poke its head through the gaps not when tommy lee jones is glaring at it don't even get me started on the stranded subway car subplot where a of hot lava is coming down but oddly enough it's not too hot to attempt a rescue it's not too smoky to see and there aren't any poisonous gases so everyone can breathe this must be la lava or lava lite you know it eats cars but is eco friendly br br there are moments of sheer camp here that almost make you wonder if this was meant to be a comedy for instance the two security guards packing up bosch paintings have a completely meaningless and farcical conversation about weight and at the end no sooner does the little boy jones rescued note that everyone looks the same while covered in ash than a rainstorm breaks out and cleans everyone up and then the sun comes out and heche says something along the lines of aw shucks br br almost achieves battlefield earth status but except for heche no one approaches travolta like badness and the technical aspects are handled pretty well if you are from the la area as i am it's kind of funny to think of a lava flow wiping out boulevard i gave it a three for the effects and the little amount of tension you get from this
<START> i bought this film from my local blockbuster for 99p an it's been sitting in my video bookcase for at least a year now then tonight i decided to see it the film was quite different to what i had expected and i didn't find any humour in it all i saw was that it was a bleak look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual orientation and i didn't really see the psycho killer plot really having a point except to add tension to the end of the film i felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job i was following her emotions and what happened around her some people would probably have seen some of the stuff that she does as funny but i could really put myself in her place loving someone but them rejecting you at every turn no matter how hard you try i thought it was a very moving film and dealt with all the different sexualities well i was expecting something like bound gagged a love story but this is a very different film not for bigots
<START> to sum this story up in a few sentences a teenage girl amy uses her hot body and supposed virginity to entice a young troubled guy matt with a potential football scholarship to provide her a full ride out of town come to find out she has quite the reputation has slept with many football players in the past hoping they would offer her the same deal both of these kids have come from troubled dysfunctional homes matt's mothers a alcoholic who repeatedly embarrasses him in front of his friends amy's mother had a bad reputation herself got pregnant with amy at a a young age matt falls in love with amy tries to straighten out his life for her very predictable ending the actress that plays amy is actually 33 years old trying to play a teenager
<START> might end up being the biggest disappointment that i will see in 2009 i seem to be the rare person who disliked park's oldboy but i think that his lady vengeance and sympathy for mr vengeance are among the best films i've seen in the 2000's decade therefore i really was looking forward to see this especially as it got such positive reviews instead i found the film clichÃ©d and broke little if any new ground to the vampire genre and while i can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this i felt park did this at very inopportune times br br others have compared contrasted this to let the right one in and i have to say that let the right one in was far superior to this one and was a fresh take on the vampire genre sadly park's take was a tired one
<START> this is unfortunately carlin's last recorded hbo concert from a series that lasted over 30 years though this may not be his best work it is excellent funny and thought provoking this recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit than most of his other concerts br br throughout his long prolific and influential career carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes towards a more viewpoint of society and culture his focus on the english language and euphemisms increased throughout the years and culminates in this performance though i would argue that his audio book when will jesus bring the pork chops best displays his vast wit with regards to language euphemisms and the breakdown of our values it's bad for ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer br br if you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church you will probably not like any of carlin's stand up material however if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy you would probably greatly enjoy this concert
<START> intended as light entertainment this film is indeed successful as such during its first half but then succumbs to a rapidly foundering script that drops it down harry judd nelson a reformed burglar and daphne gina gershon an aspiring actress are employed as live window mannequins at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within whereupon they witness from their less than protective glass observation point an apparent homicide occurring on the street the ostensible murderer miles raymond nick mancuso a local sculptor returns the following day to observe the mannequins since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior night's violent event and when one of the posing pair flinches the fun begins daphne and harry report their observations at a local police station but when the detective taking a crime report remembers harry's criminal background he becomes cynical there are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed and this one manages to utilize most of them including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion a low budget affair shot in vancouver even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote the always capable gershon tries to make something of her role but mancuso is incredibly histrionic bizarrely so as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein although the film sags into nonsense cinematographer glen macpherson prefers to not follow suit as he sets up with camera and lighting some splendidly realised compositions that a viewer may focus upon while ignoring plot holes and witless dialogue a well crafted score appropriately based upon the action is contributed by hal beckett the mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a bantering manner by nelson and gershon but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic predictability takes over the direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view and post production flaws set the work back farther than should be expected for a basic thriller
<START> i've read approximately 10 reviews of this film but haven't taken any of them to heart harrison ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring and i really don't see what any of these things have to do with the film as i recall he had bad hair plus bad reviews in blade runner but it's still a favorite among us it is slower than the majority of his previous films but not worthy of the it has received br br i would gladly pay 7 50 just to watch a bald harrison ford mow his lawn
<START> this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched at the age of 12 i was up late and ran across the movie it was on the usa channel gilbert up all night i will never forget at the time my friends and i were really struggling with different issues some sexual you know 12 is a very rough and weird age it seems you are stuck in between being a little girl and being a young lady this movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me i now have a daughter that is 12 have been searching for a couple years for this movie if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age
<START> kasparov vs deep blue is no doubt a fascinating story but i don't think you'd know it by watching this movie i think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that ibm cheated and what does this theory hinge upon the idea that at one point the computer made a move that looked human i am not a chess grandmaster or a computer scientist and while i don't doubt that the move looked human to me it doesn't seem beyond the realm of possibility that the most powerful chess playing computer ever created could make a surprising move or that such a machine could beat even a genius like kasparov the movie gets way too much mileage out of this theory and not enough out of the personalities of the people involved that could have made it a much more interesting story the direction also relies way too much on the conceits of a pointlessly whispered narration and the imagery of an 18th century chess playing machine that looks like one of those animatronic gypsy you see at the carnival also the story was slowed down by many empty shots of kasparov revisiting the scene of the crime i don't doubt that kasparov and the chess community found behavior vexing but i don't think it's any different than you would find from any other big corporation at the end of the movie you are left with the feeling that kasparov is a huge crybaby and the deep blue programmers are either victims or cheats i think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe the conspiracy theory which he almost certainly did he should have presented a lot more evidence in fact more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place the whole thing left me with a sour taste in my mouth
<START> the folks at aardman have done a cool cute and wild adaptation of their short films of wallace and gromit to feature length as the man and his dog inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence or practicality for the latter in this case they've invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet english village in particular for mrs or for those who are much to the chagrin of victor quartermaine who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle wallace and gromit seem to have success with their machine but wallace has a mix up a machine he's made to make more food suddenly criss crosses himself with a rabbit the curse is on br br a lot of this is about as much light hearted fun that a kid's movie could ask for but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick looney tunes which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville granted the aardman guys nick park and steve box have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material it's never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny ho ho not funny ha ha side a tired criticism but i'll say it curse of the were rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition the golden bullet story is a doozy park and box and company never lose sight of glee in the material br br it's fuzzy and warm hearted and completely off the wall for the kids even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets such as the truck wallace and gromit drive around in and for adults there's little barbs of funky absurdist tones in the midst of a classic english farce only and i'm probably a minority opinion here when compared to chicken run it's almost a little slight a work there's less any plot than there is a series of running gags and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese and horrible men with egos in their guns like the fiennes voiced quartermaine but when it strikes best it's one of the most entertaining films of 2005 it gives me a big goofy smile anytime it's on tv
