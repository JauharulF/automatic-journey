<START> i had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci fi network it reminded me of the irwin allen tv series of the late 60's time tunnel etc excellent effects they beat star trek 5 done 20 years later but then that wasn't very hard to accomplish br br i found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production they would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters' level but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro politics surprisingly similar to today's european union br br the plot is indeed reminiscent of twilight zone in general as other users have pointed but in this case it's a compliment br br great sets by the way br br 7 10
<START> it takes an eternity for this typically over simplistic and idiotic stephen king based film to finally get out of the starting blocks about half an hour is spent on needless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might excite bored housewives and apathetic in soapy dramas but this is supposed to be the horror genre or so i naively thought the mutt fails to look all that fearsome which leonard maltin the notoriously clueless hopeless and always grinning film critic would disagree with he considers cujo to be genuinely frightening i often do have to wonder if maltin is genuinely thick or merely likes to do favors for his hollywood friends it's both illogical and inconsistent the way wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury and naturally her car breaks down just when she needs it to save her life this is one of the oldest horror film clichÃ©s trust king to use it to minimum effect the premise is imbecilic too banal even for a horror film a rabid mutt attacks a family is that it this sort of thing barely constitutes a 3 minute sub sub plot in your average zombie film i think even cujo must have sensed that he was starring in a turkey have terrible agents but what i really don't understand is how people can actually throw themselves at the cujo book and read it from cover to cover these fans must be immortal that's the only explanation i e why they treat time as such a meaningless commodity br br bodycount 3
<START> i gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10 if it had had just a teensy weensy bit more plot line i would have given it 10 br br nonetheless it is a highly interesting film br br judith playing a likable old floozy should have been given the oscar for her performance br br emily grace portraying alice whom i had never seen before also does an excellent job and has the sexiest body i think i've ever seen on film br br in a beat to heck old car alice has lit out from the n e for florida where she has a friend or maybe it's her sister i'm not sure and that's my fault not the film's and high hopes of going to college which she and her family can't really afford br br she seems rather vulnerable out there on the road alone and sure enough she encounters some slightly rough looking characters and shortly after that it's discovered there's a hole in one of her tires br br she is at a rest stop at the time and is assisted by a woman named sandra and her husband bill an older couple who are traveling in an rv br br they're going south to florida and take her under their wing but is everyone quite the way they're presenting themselves flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life
<START> this is my favourite film and i think it is perfect unlike virtually any other film i can name i never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this or that or whatever is this the definition of a work of art i think so every in mishima is perfect and it all flows from the schrader's script i've always sort of liked paul schrader's work you can't argue with taxi driver and light sleeper is an amazing film but while his writing often seems to border on the bombastic his directing style is usually non existent this is deliberate i think because his films usually deal with a search for redemption and are set in the real world ugly and harsh his style suits his themes as he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way and lets them show the audience the truth of the situation imagine if schrader had directed taxi driver or bringing out the dead instead of scorsese but like the protagonists of those two films while mishima the man was ideal schrader material right wing vain and at odds with society his works were subtle and beautiful in fact he had a secondary writing career as a woman's writer churning out what can reasonably be described as romantic potboilers so you wouldn't necessarily imagine that schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film i think the film shows that he was the script he helped fashion splits mishima the man into three parts his life his death and his mind his life is represented in black and white still camera formal compositions his death for which he will always be best remembered is handheld documentary style and his mind is represented by the dramatised extracts from his novels each one revealing the thought processes of this complex man who hardly ever wrote a character that wasn't a reflection of himself these dramatisations are beautiful to look at thanks to eiko remarkable production design and schrader's imaginative staging in all parts the acting is superb especially from ken as mishima who captures the essential charm arrogance and narcissism of the man the photography is excellent throughout and contains images that the viewer will retain forever finally the music is simply superb perfectly matching the images although written and recorded before shooting adjusted during the editorial process and then re recorded how much the music influenced the shoot i do not know but it bonds perfectly to the image i have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is what schrader is trying to say you know the big stuff about life death etc but i do not think the film is saying anything mishima has already said it the film simply repeats
<START> one of my absolute favorite childhood films the chipmunk adventure packs incredible fun geared for young and old alike the animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever put in an animated feature who could forget the dynamic boys girls of rock n' roll the exciting diamond dolls and the heartrending my mother br br this should be considered a nostalgic classic animated gem from the eighties it's too bad they don't make them like this anymore most animated films today resort to violence crude humor or sentimental mush except of course the folks from pixar br br bottom line an amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages
<START> when i first heard about greek i figured i would watch it because it sounded ridiculous another of abc family's so bad they're almost good shows but tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected br br as a member of a greek society i can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus and are also very fun to play with just on are own let alone to watch on a tv screen the opening scene to an only slightly dramatized version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from there br br this isn't a show for over sensitive greeks if you get offended even at jokes about things that aren't so great about greek life then you'll spend the entire first episode and probably many other cringing and yelling but everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it it's nothing new but when it comes to college nothing ever is
<START> gordon scott with his well coiffed hair hourglass figure and weird pidgin english has to be the worst of all the tarzans as for the other actors in this mess they're on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class i've seen used car dealers in tv commercials who can act better they make clayton moore look like laurence olivier and where does jane the dull eve brent get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle i realize these were made for kids but wow the plot line seemed ok but the director should have required more from his actors i realize even the weissmuller films have a few flaws but this one seemed so low budget
<START> when pinky a qualified electrician is released from prison his parole officer has found him a job working at a big city bank when some of the crime underworld from his past learn of his position they plan to exploit it and rob the bank pinky is at first horrified because he really wants to go straight but when a twist of fate happens pinky begins to think one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth br br also known as the mayfair bank caper amongst others this is a hugely enjoyable piece that is quintessential 1970s london and all it's highly dubious fashions are lit up like a christmas tree in ralph thomas and guy cunningly crafty caper if the viewer can accept david niven as an aged crime lord of some it's not easy i can tell you then a nightingale sang in berkeley square could well surprise you the actors aren't pulling up any trees for sure but it's really not hurting the picture at all it has an honest fun quality that is never less than entertaining the score and soundtrack is perhaps guilty of over during the dramatic criminal moments but it's a minor complaint to leave me thinking this is an under seen british gem br br richard jordan takes the lead role of pinky obviously hoping to lure in american viewers 70s heart throb oliver tobias a mass of hair is in there to keep the ladies interested whilst the blokes get the pleasurable sight of elke sommer and her delightful legs for company moving along at a decent enough clip and containing a seriously rewarding finale a nightingale sang in berkeley square deserves far better than the paltry 5 7 rating here on imdb but just how many people have seen it i wonder hmm go on give it a go if you the chance it's good stuff 7 10
<START> the revelation here is lana turner's dancing ability though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer miss turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film br br so viewers take notice here mgm were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet and were therefore her to everything from andy hardy to doctor br br in two girls on broadway however she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number my wonderful one let's dance this number is conceived and filmed as a sort of hybrid between a busby berkely style extravaganza and the sort of routines hermes pan was designing for astaire and rogers at rko br br thus the number opens with george murphy and miss turner depicted as bar patrons with full chorus before a curtain of black lame wherein mr murphy croons the number to miss turner then the camera on a boom pulls backward in a remarkable crane shot to reveal an enormous stage and a rotating set equipped with steps columns and sliding walls br br from this point on murphy and turner execute a fast stepping variety of moods and attitudes including lifts spins soft shoe and ending with an electrifying series of conjoined pirouettes that concludes with murphy both lifting and rotating turner with thrilling speed to a racing orchestra br br all told a dizzying feat that proves miss turner was fully capable of more than holding her own as a dancer though i daresay most of her admirers would balk at relinquishing her from her throne as the queen of melodrama
<START> ok i did think that it would be horrible but when i saw it i was proven wrong emily did a superb job as did jason london sue was under used and under written the meanies were ok dylan bruno and rachel blanchard are definitely the stand outs as for the things the teens do and how people claim it's all wrong whatever my friends and i use the term swank a lot and i have driven a car and had someone steer as i changed it's pretty much all there i've just never been at a after game party in a house that big with it's very own light show the deaths are good the best involves a pair of glasses a spear gun and a pool all in that order i must say there will be people who hate it but i'm not one of them
<START> i don't leave imdb comments about films but this this film was bad very bad i fast forwarded through most of it stopping where i hoped the acting had improved since the last scene only to continue with the fast forwards formula plot once the obvious murderers were discounted there was only the one left and that was in the first five minutes scene by scene it felt as though i'd already read the script before because there were no surprises no mystery the tori character bad bad acting a true waste of time on dvd and a definite 'let's go to bed option if it's the only thing on television if you watch this film you will find yourself realising you'll never be able to get back the time you've just wasted
<START> andrew mccarthy played the role of an atheist very well i liked the plot of the movie it gave something to think about other than a comedy it had a very twisted mind and a good cop versus god a very well used plot line
<START> i wasn't expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face julie walters rupert and laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about ben rupert does this when he meets retired actress julie walters and begins to express his ideas with words he slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter 75 of the time the film satisfies all and i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities it is a must see
<START> i read the book before seeing the movie and the film is one of the best adaptations out there very true and faithful to the book sean penn and sarandon are amazing robbins is a talented filmaker and i wish he would add more to his he made the film very haunting and intentionally slow paced to add depth an especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end
<START> this is so overly clichÃ©d you'll want to switch it off after the first 45 minutes the beginning is very interesting with a fair going on and someone gets killed this movie would have been better set on this setting br br so jill johnson is a depressed with boyfriend issues i don't see the point of adding her breakup with her boyfriend occurs in any of the events in the story br br since jill has come home late her father sends her to babysit for the in their glamorous home in a deserted lake the kids are sleeping and the maid is cleaning another empty house to the side for their son who's at college ok br br after about half an hour of her stalking around the house by herself she gets a couple of hang ups ooh scary ones to which her friend comes to the rescue to come up with a couple of high school lines about 'love' and whatever friend leaves and goes to her car to which then she drops her keys uhhh then the music she fumbles to pick them up and gets into her car which of course doesn't start how clichÃ©'d is that so she disappears d jill alone again uh most of this movie is with her by herself so there's not much dialog so more hangups she calls the police who say they cant help her but call back if she has any more problems br br so then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling or her boyfriends friends are calling they have been but only once like thats supposed to be scary much oh and did i mention her friend just now comes on caller id and some creepy man voice comes on she gets all freaked out and shyt br br yeah so skip that she see's the light in the house of the son go on so she runs through the woods with music as her companion and goes in br br ah its so boring i cant continue
