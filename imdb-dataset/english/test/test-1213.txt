<START> the new hope of romanian cinema if this is the new hope then i wouldn't really like to see the saving hero of such a prolific cinema romanian cinema that is now seriously where should i start 1 the crappy scenario are you kidding me this is not even believable not to mention it's high degree of stupidity 2 the direction what direction this movie should have had psychological tension at least that since they have decided to make it look as trashy as possible i admit is no polanski hitchcock fincher or lynch the list could go on but at least the minimum of effort would have been appreciated 3 the language i don't understand why almost every single romanian director believes that if you make the movie as miserable and obscene as possible then you have art i don't mind explicit language or bad image quality as long as the final result makes it worthwhile in this case it doesn't there is nothing to comment upon since everything this movie wants to say was already told thousand times the characters are far too thinly portrayed to become memorable the shocking events that occur are also poorly illustrated and become unimportant this film relies only on the self induced emotions on the we must hype someone was found murdered so we must feel sad frightened or panicked someone went through this and that so we must feel in a certain way that's baloney because a movie is a piece of fiction nothing is for real here so the only true emotions are those that you discover when you wander deep into it's world the movie's that is br br
<START> not only is this a very interesting exploration of tourette's and how we react to people in our lives it has some of the most well filmed views of a bleak northern winter landscape there's nothing pretty about this film but it stays with the viewer
<START> i really should have learned more about this movie before renting it it was one of those movies where you keep watching it figuring it's got to get better then when it ends you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back ice t did his bad guy thing and well that was the highlight of the evening the pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits the script was lacking and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and going unconscious was incredible because he drove better than i could have on one of my best days all in all i have seen worse but this sure isn't one i'd recommend or want to remember
<START> the bone snatcher starts out extremely promising with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the african desert whilst checking out in the desert three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half eaten bones the expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a mutated ant queen and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well director jason sustains a respectable level of tension just until the nature of the monster is identified immediately after that the film rapidly turns into an ordinary creature feature with all the characters dropping out of the survival race one by one the second half of the bone snatcher is boring with the inevitable love story clichÃ©s as well as a complete absence of gory murder set pieces the characters all are insufferable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance there's the rookie who has to prove himself the female with brain capacity apart from her hot looks the obnoxious experienced guy who redeems himself at the end through self sacrifice and Â last but not least Â who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all kind of voodoo names tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space menaces of alien and predator the ant creature has infrared vision and crumbles when shot at yawn the movie actually just benefits from its unique setting and the handful of nasty images of bodies this could have been a modest gem but instead it's less than mediocre avoid
<START> i was just looking at the 100 bottom movies according to imdb users seeing if there was anything to review that i haven't yet and i found this little screen gem one of those occasions when you see a movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it darn well i guess i will get ridiculed and spat upon here but for me this was a pretty good flick when i saw it it has been awhile however i remember it used to come on hbo late at night and i watched it two or three times and i haven't seen it really since and i would love to watch it again now knowing jolie was in it the story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them i think that is basically all there is to it throw in a few scenes with jack palance and we have our movie some good action here and there and some blood and violence as well there is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other the dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film but for a b movie it is really good i don't know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those
<START> when i saw this in the cinema i remember wincing at the bad acting about a minute or two into the first scene then immediately telling myself no this has to get better it didn't the performances are pretty uniformly teak 'n pine and no there is no sexual chemistry in this film whatsoever just the awkward posturings of a reasonably comely discreetly talentless actress who seems born to grace the cover of and not much else besides if the scriptwriter thought that making mÃ©rimÃ©e a character was a stunningly original creative ploy he perhaps ought to get out more and if he'd given the matter a bit more thought would have realised that the story of carmen is just crying out for a thoughtful iconoclastic parodic deconstruction not this leave your brains at the affair of ersatz passion and comic book dialogue this is contemporary spanish cinema at its worst br br
<START> christmas in august is a perfect movie a flawless movie about all the flaws of humanity on the outside it may look like a movie about death but is in fact a movie about life i simply cannot recommend this movie enough and be not afraid dear readers it is not a depressing film as stated it's a movie about the brightness of life coached under the guise of death you will laugh you will cry you will realize that life is fragile and short and you will leave the viewing with a better understanding of how precious life is br br 10 out of 10 br br go to www nixflix com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films
<START> i can not believe the positive reaction to this movie i had great expectations for it and was disappointed first of all they used every cheesy racism clichÃ© in the book it was so predictable for instance from the second the young latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger matt dillon's character has been played a million times a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie the predictability hardly ended with those characters a phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script the morals of the story were pc to the max there were a few clever twists but not nearly enough the dialouge was embarrassing at times it wasn't all bad i just can't believe this movies high score so far it was somewhat entertaining just a little insulting to ones intelligence i admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short
<START> in the wasteland that hollywood productions have become of late this movie in and of itself is truly manna from heaven br br in what could best be described as a cute movie approximately 350 years of movie acting experience allright give or take 100 years joyously lights up the screen to tell a tale of deceit remorse and redemption about a catholic family in buffalo ny br br truly well positioned to take its place in the feel good movie genre this quiet little independent film by the burton sisters' five sisters productions company will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart all while renewing your faith in mankind br br from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo ny to the final credits the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family anywhere yet somehow this particular gathering of family and family by association in a small non descript house in buffalo more than fits the bill if you've never been to buffalo you'll leave the theater with thoughts of shuffling off for a visit shots of the city landmarks and surroundings help to bring a quaint down to earth tone to the film which suits it just fine the quiet beauty of the queen city of the great lakes compliments rather than detracts from the tale that is being told if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country's second cities instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere the end results would be so much more believable br br great performances by shirley jones frank gorshin wendy malick jill and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent hollywood's flavor of the week any time br br go see this movie br br you've wandered in hollywood's desert for too long
<START> i love this movie even though i rated it a 4 that's because the acting the plot and the budget were all slated to the b universe even before this movie was released but that's ok it is an entertaining film that has a lot to offer br br i remember what leonard maltin said about plan 9 from outer space a film so bad that it's great lacking the ufo alien plot the thing the couldn't die relies on the supernatural a buried head looking for it's body hypnosis etc to tell it's story the acting is stilted the camera work second class and the settings are limited but boy what a movie this film is available in the bootleg market if you find a copy buy it
<START> i made sure to see this film because it is a 1950s sci fi film one of my favorite genres unfortunately while i was looking forward to either bug eyed aliens or power mad the aliens in this film were a major disappointment first you only see one very briefly at the beginning and he looked pretty ordinary and you also only got a tiny glimpse of a spaceship second the alien was neither the evil conquerer or the benevolent friend of mankind but a real odd ball and finally the plot itself seemed so dumb preachy and heavy handed that it elicited more yawns than thrills br br as the film begins five people from five different parts of the world germany britain russia china and the usa are kidnapped by an alien the alien gives each of them devices by which they can destroy all life on the planet if they so choose because the alien admits that his race of people would love to inhabit the earth but they themselves won't kill to get it then he returns them all while it's 100 obvious that no one would want to use these devices the alien then announces on tv the identities of the five without telling that the weapons are that powerful so all the in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five going into hiding and one being tortured to get him to reveal how the device works as the soviets want to use it this part of the film just seemed pretty silly sure the ussr was an evil and corrupt nation sorry but it's fact especially under stalin they never would have thought of using it like they did in the movie later one of the five the german scientist somehow figures out that the devices can also be used to kill only all the evil people who hate freedom so he uses it to wipe out all the evil commies and presumably others who were anti freedom and the world then becomes a paradise preachy silly and full of plot holes this movie just isn't worth your time though it is an interesting relic simply for the way it addresses communism in particular the tensions between nato and the soviets
<START> before i continue forth with the new millennium i will go back in time once more because i had completely forgotten about these gems br br in 1987 disney while still a low company in the 80s was able to start a series of films on television called not quite human about a geeky teenager who like in inspector gadget looks like a human but is really a robot now this screams 80s along with other films like tron and honey i shrunk the kids because it combines everything of yesteryear with the technologies of tomorrow br br my parents remember seeing this on the tv back then back when i was just born or something however my very first encounter with this film was on the old disney channel one time i've seen this and the other parts on my 12th in may of '99 br br not quite human is a very good series of films to watch if you can ever find these movies again br br has this been shown recently if so give me an e mail or personal message br br 10 10
<START> h g wells is spinning no doubt about it br br really this would have been a decent sci fi adventure movie if it hadn't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson i kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel what resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardization br br the novel is a great sci fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it probably because they read it when they're very young is that it's overflowing with social commentary the and are a satire of the class distinctions of victorian england and the overall message of the film is that everything decays and degenerates a satiric jab at victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever there's no love story no romance with a beautiful woman in the novel the are 3 foot tall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal the time traveler does befriend an woman but it's clear he thinks of her more like a pet and anyway she's killed before the novel ends br br this movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to why he wants to travel through time the treacly romance and the lessons he must learn are enough to make film fans vomit br br the journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster ok not bad but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates as in the book more a reflection of the times i guess as the george pal version had a nuclear war take place br br the general story ugh a total misrepresentation of the novel the are too competent and warlike the are too intelligent the is an embarrassment and there's no setup he just shows up in time to be killed yawn br br samantha does ok guy pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain reportedly he broke a rib while filming this he also looks unhealthy and overly thin as if he had been ill for a long time before making this br br a sad sorry film version of one of the world's classics h g wells deserves better much better br br
<START> i caught this movie on the horror channel and was quite impressed by the film's gothic atmosphere and tone as a big fan of all things vampire related i am always happy to see a new variation of the vampire mythos in this case a ghoul like creature residing in a lovecraftian other dimension the director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject using the decadent art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a tale of love spanning time and space the pure love of friendship opposed to the lust for blood and life by the vampires in the story the characters in the story are transported to another dimension by the means of a mind altering substance where a shape shifting vampire creature appears to grant them their hearts desires whilst draining them of their life essence there are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle i enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story chris ivan and alex who were very attractive hunks always a plus point in a vampire story for the female viewers the special effects make up and creature effects were well done and the set design of the vampire's dimension was very effective all in all an enjoyable take on vampire myths and recommended for anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action the only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more eroticism and nudity as it would have suited the plot and themes
<START> unconditional love is one of the best movies i've seen in a while it's an emotional roller coaster one of my favorite scenes is the pub scene when dirk tells grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him you expect the worst when the old woman holds her glass up and says 'to the memory of victor fox and the whole pub follows suit i wanted to cry the funeral scene is hysterical julie does it in her typical julie andrews style johnathan pryce is excellent as victor grace is one of kathy bates' best roles meredith eaton steals just about every scene that she is in rupert everett does some of his finest work in unconditional as dirk the kiss between rupert and meredith took me to another bout of hysterics in this day and age of gay rights being questioned i think this movie should be seen by all as a gay man in my late 40's i have seen people lose everything when a loved one dies so to all involved in the making of this film
