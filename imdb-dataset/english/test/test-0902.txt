<START> it's very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot for the viewer while some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves i embrace for its irreverence there is a plot it's just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer this is a film that invites numerous interpretations as all great art does however this film is also very entertaining making it a rare film experience it's simultaneously provocative and fun
<START> like most sports movies which have come out in the past this movie is similar in respects that it is based on fact what sets this movie apart is that its about a rugby team a sport that not too many americans are familiar with set that aside this movie is very rewarding piece of film noir it reminds me of we are marshall but with a smaller budget and an independent movie feel its a fine effort by director ryan little to bring us a story about a rebellious teen played by sean farris never back down as rick penning that finds himself in an odd place both on and off the field despite a few plot lines holes this film has heart rewarding each of its viewers with good characters that we can identify with also good performances by supporting actors gary cole as coach larry neal mcdonough as coach penning dad i felt myself go through a lot of different emotions watching movie in the end i was left with a feeling of faith in mankind a hope for the future for my children especially if there are coaches out there like
<START> wow what exciting visual effects i also loved the costumes and artwork the circus and ethereal feel to the film was sublime it just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist as she is trapped in her imagination there is never a sense of peril unlike say david lynch's films which haunt every time this also draws attention to which age group this film is aimed at who would this engage br br mirrormask is obviously going to draw comparisons with labyrinth with the teen angst fantasy theme but unfortunately it doesn't really come close to delivering the same henson essence the ill mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while lapping up the eye candy br br not agonisingly awful a la the cell nor as engagingly dreamlike as labyrinth a forgettable but good looking fantasy
<START> this is a very odd movie for harold lloyd at least in regard to the sweet character he played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s instead of a nice guy he and pollard are con men out to rob everyone blind in a particularly successful con chester pretends to have lost a very valuable ring and a bit later harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the ring the ring of course is a cheap one dropped and then found by harold but the greed of the stooge is so great he convinces harold to say nothing and sell him the valuable ring and then they run away to enjoy their luck again and again they find until they meet up with a woman who herself is a con woman working with a guy doing fake she arranges a nifty con and takes all the money they stole and has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the money br br as luck would have it the two con men stumble into the lady's shady business when no one is home soon the lady returns and messes with their minds releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked ways br br all around this is a completely odd and contrived film but it is also exceedingly funny as the jokes work very well and lloyd and pollard make an excellent team plus while creepy and strange i liked seeing pollard dressed like a lady
<START> i was talked into seeing this by a girlfriend john was a good guy sweet sensitive and looks great with no shirt on i thought it was a love story about both of them but it was mainly about his reactions to her letters savannah was a likable character at the start of the movie but once she dumped him i lost respect for her she said it tore her apart being away from him and it was hard he was the one a million miles away he was killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters she didn't have it hard she had family money and he had a tour of duty i was so frustrated at the ending when he forgave her he was too much of a sweetheart i would have waited the 3 years and welcomed him home with open arms
<START> so some people might argue that this can't possible be the worst movie ever made and no it's not i have seen movies with weaker plots worse acting and so on br br so why do i hate this movie Ã¼ber alles well it's basically about a man who gets kidnapped for many years and when he comes out he tries to find out who did it and why to get revenge the problem i have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror but br br major spoilers stop reading if you don't want to know br br our main character basically gets tricked into having sex with his own daughter and he wants to cut out his own tongue so his enemy won't tell her because she didn't know it is so humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission and why did he deserve this because many years ago he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment in the wrong way he went on and told some people and as a result she commits suicide and viola it's the brother who put our main character through all this just for that i have wondered maybe i hate this movie so much because i think his punishment is way too harsh maybe because i feel this movie doesn't condemn incest but somehow confuses it with love maybe it's because i expected something else br br end of spoilers br br believe me nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end and i'm very serious you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there well i felt goddamn dirty after watching this movie and i really wish i'd never seen it it stayed with me for days and some might ask well isn't that the purpose of a good movie the ability to affect us in such ways yes it can be but this movie not only made me sick it made me feel violated
<START> two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a storyline that was hard to resist however the script the direction and some scenes were just awful i kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie my only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which underlies the plot of the movie but knew the movie was filled with flaws br br this film could have been so much better and reached a larger audience accordingly what makes me think this is that with all of the problems of the film some scenes being painfully bad to watch i still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself
<START> this is a road movie at least the movie is in yellow i think that suggests a road movie i can't say much positive about the delivery it's bad acting certainly their english camera looks like it is done by a kid there's a bomb with counter and suddenly a beetle is falling from the sky since it was so cliche we actually the whole time and that was the most fun of the movie this movie should be released in america but i'm not sure you should go because that might suggest that is the quality we produce the explosions look boring basically everything is over the top everything is just too much the yellow quality the sound the babe etc find all the cliche part in other movies put them together and you have the delivery
<START> after seeing the dvd release of the blues brothers and their mention of wired on belushi's bio my boyfriend and i were hungry for more information on john belushi i had heard of wired but didn't know too much about it and found it way in the back of the local rental store i understand that dan akroyd was really p ed over this movie and i thought it was because it didn't portray them in a good light but that had nothing to do with it br br the movie starts out okay until they wheel in john's body to the morgue when he wakes up on the autopsy table and decides to run for it then begins the utter tastelessness of this movie john is subjected to viewing his life and all of the turmoil he created with angel a puerto rican cab driver with a wicked sense of humor subjecting him to criticism and attempting to try to get him to cross over br br the two actors who portray john and dan look nothing even remotely close to the real actors let alone anyone else related for that matter i e lorne michaels making it difficult to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in real life but that is the tip of the iceberg br br i believe this was supposed to be an artsy film john constantly being tormented by drugs i e the powdered soap in the bathroom being cocaine in such a way that was also difficult to follow the flashbacks are choppy also making it difficult to understand br br probably the most tasteless scene was when john is literally forced to undergo his autopsy and is in pain while they remove his heart to weigh it saying that it was abnormally large due to drug use obesity yeah we get the point without the grotesque portrayal br br there are very few other actors we know of in the movie where's carrie fisher for instance they were incredibly close and jim belushi would have been a great person to show it looks very cheaply made we felt it looked as if the graphics were from the early 80s or late 70s it felt as if it was filmed in about a week and all in all didn't show the side to john at all i felt i knew a little bit more about him from watching episodes of saturday night live br br on one last note bob woodward comes across narcissistic by placing himself in the movie arguing with john about writing his life story for someone who was supposed to be very highbrow concerning the bust on nixon his calibur of person could match any writer in the national enquirer and therefore losing my interest in any of his work from this point forward br br skip this movie if you want to see more on john watch his movies see clips of dan akroyd talking about him or hope someone has the taste to make another movie on john that goes along the lines of man on the moon which is ultimately what we were expecting i guess this was a moral kind of movie you know don't do drugs but i guess the creators of this film didn't understand that his death made a number of people like carrie fisher stop doing drugs altogether for that reason
<START> ok so my summary line is a cheap trick but the movie is full of them and it gets absurdly praised so br br i caught this one on tv uncut as tv here shows all movies that's for you americans who might say i didn't like it because i saw a cut tv version fortunately that's only an us thing and had no idea about what it was i switched on caught the last minutes of a show and the movie began within a minute i was begging it was a comedy given the particularly ridiculous clichÃ©d beginning yes it's a bad movie within the movie i know but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested i don't even know why i didn't switch channels and yes in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy albeit an unintentional one br br marina is pretty enough but gosh what a dreadful performance while casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough she doesn't talk so bye bye language barrier yet sorry marina baby playing mute doesn't mean impersonating harpo marx her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments just look at her when she draws an x in the air while stalked by the killer he wants to kill you it's no time to play zorro we get plenty of running upstairs stuff passing for tension as in the worst slashers and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other ugh will hollywood ever learn yet the best worst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and well i have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub but i'm sure you can't see the blue cartoon rays in real life do you and how about immediately trusting a mean looking guy because he says he's a cop and not asking him to show you his credentials ok so he turns out to be a real cop but still not asking for the badge makes no sense plot wise we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop screen writing 101 and how about the big twist don't tell me you didn't see that coming from 200 miles away br br i feel sorry for poor old alec guinness and his useless stock footage cameo now i think about this what's the point in giving him a mystery guest star credit in the end titles the movie's over there's no mystery anymore and everybody and their brother have identified guinness even non movie buffs will recognize the old guy from 'star wars' yet better off this way so we can pretend it's not the late great actor br br people keep comparing this to of all people hitchcock i suppose it has to be john hitchcock the milkman as the late sir alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this let alone making it and this gets a 6 8 10 it's bottom 100 material but then we're talking a rating system that allows 'the lord of the rings the return of the king' to appear as the third best movie ever made check top 100 so br br 2 10
<START> ron hall pulls a triple threat as he writes directs and stars in assassins' derek washington hall is your clichÃ©d cop on a mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer no not buffy to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the grave br br assassins' is a horrible film it rips off so many other films can you say blade that it never even attempts to establish it's own identity the script is non existent the action is horrible who says a micro budget stimulates creativity there is nothing even remotely interesting here you will get nothing out of this except a headache stay away at all costs
<START> i am a big fan of horror movies and know a lot of info on serial killers obviously the director of this one refused to research the film he was creating because half of the movie was fictional more than that the character of ed gein was portrayed in the wrong light i did not rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend erica i rented it to watch ed gein and his legendary story this movie was awful the only reason i gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the gore wasn't too bad acting horrible actors sub par movie waste of time br br a big upset all around but i wont give up my search for a good horror movie
<START> ultra cheezy soundtrack vinnie tries really hard very tiring script that flashes between past and present cheap editing saw the boom twice don't bother ultra cheezy soundtrack vinnie tries really hard very tiring script that flashes between past and present cheap editing saw the boom twice don't bother ultra cheezy soundtrack vinnie tries really hard very tiring script that flashes between past and present cheap editing saw the boom twice don't bother ultra cheezy soundtrack vinnie tries really hard very tiring script that flashes between past and present cheap editing saw the boom twice don't bother
<START> this movie is trash because out of many reasons it is based on mark book which is also trash let me must say that mark is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight and others that right this type of trash belong in jail for the movie itself being based on the book was horrible as well the only reason that this murder case became such a big book and movie was because the guy is related thru his aunts marriage to the kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover up murders they are just a family and middle america needs to get over the obsession this poor guy and his family have been hounded by the police for years they couldn't get tommy so they went after micheal its amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence that supports that he didn't do it besides the facts that the statute of limitations among other things should have kept this trial from being brought back after twenty years for the love of god don't watch this garbage
<START> i was stan in the movie dreams come true stan was the friend that worked at the factory with the main character and ended getting his arm smashed in the machinery and got carried out screaming where was the ambulance the acting in this movie was for the most part pretty poor with mostly local actors from the fox valley wisconsin i saw the movie on the big screen it played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen i may be bias but overall i enjoyed it also the soundtrack was the band spooner who later became garbage my brother steve charlton was also in the movie he played the man who comes to the door on crutches to talk with the police
