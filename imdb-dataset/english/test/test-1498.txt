<START> i admire the effort of trying to reach out to the rest of the world with this tragic story however the movie is done so badly that most people i know couldn't sit through it the movie was relevant to me since i lived in estonia when these events took place but it is written horribly and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing on the matter the music choices do not flow well with the movie it seems as if someone just turned a cd player on in the background to put the actors in the mood the acting well what acting the only people acting are jÃ¼rgen prochnow and donald sutherland even though prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role as far as the relationship development goes between erik jÃ¼rgen prochnow and julia greta scacchi it is like watching a train wreck there is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their sincere moments this is not a good movie there is a difference between trying to get a message out could've been a documentary and trying to make a good movie this is a failure and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it as a matter of fact as a native of estonia i am offended by this miserable effort this tragedy deserves more than just a homemade low budget ghost chase excuse of a movie this could have been much more
<START> i went to see this because i have some friends in the ukraine but the film moved me beyond what i expected by turning out to be a perfect blend of belly holding laughs alex's strange use of english situational comedy and heaviness bordering on depressing i loved the range it made me want to jump in to an old car and hit the road for the ukraine alex plays his guide part perfectly and provides a great counterpoint to elijah woods' poker faced earnestness the film shows the positive side of humanity when ppl of differing cultures can bond and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation even when they went into it with preconceived notions and prejudices and how this can open up doorways into deeply buried memories there is a lot in this film
<START> the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to an american werewolf in london none of the characters from the previous movie return and aren't even mentioned in this movie by name so as a sequel fails one would say br br i dare to say the opposite br br an american werewolf in paris is a charming effective horror movie it's one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too and i have seen quite my share such as an american werewolf in london the howling wolfen the wolfman and the underworld trilogy br br the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed br br i really liked the acting in this film especially the two stars of the movie the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her they have good chemistry together but the other two americans also play their roles nicely i didn't really find anything annoying about the acting so thumbs up for that br br the effects on the werewolves are nice it doesn't look too cheap or fake to me of course the opinions are divided about this subject but let's just say that i wasn't disappointed br br there's also a good amount of humor in this movie there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time br br so to sum it up an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to it's predecessor but it's still an enjoyable movie perfect for fans of werewolves 7 out of 10 stars
<START> i first saw a poster advertising this film on a street in helsinki finland in june of 2000 what caught my attention was the proud proclamation advising all readers that the movie although itself french had been banned in france upon returning home to new york i discovered that one of the art house movie theaters in the city was screening the film and so with my finnish fiancee decided to see what all the fuss was about boy did we ever br br from the comments read here and the reviews i knew the movie was violent and sexually explicit not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions i went with an open mind to see what had perturbed the sensibilities of our gallic cousins presumably as anyone who is reading this will know the story involves two women who embark on a crime and murder spree in france the movie has english subtitles the resemblance to thelma and louise however ends with that the sex is unusually graphic and in copious supply as is the violence a lot of stomping to death and a lot of blood and other organic matter splattering after bullet impact br br on an intellectual level one could make the case that the film's very essence is the relationship of sex and violence as manifested by the only sex these women know one is a small time prostitute and the other has earned money from time to time by performing in pornographic films when they during their descent into crime and murder have the upper hand over their sexual situations they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand it is important to note however that the victims of their rampage are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex of which there are several but innocent passersby a woman at an atm for example as well br br i myself do not really understand why the repeated porn movie shots were all that necessary except to depict the physical contact as cruel and debased and the unrelenting gore did get rather tedious after the first few violent spasms br br it is a coarse and crude movie but in fairness it is dealing with coarse and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances from one point of view the lives of the french is explored and it's pretty grim a travelogue for france it definitely is not perhaps that's why the french banned it br br
<START> got back from morocco then where my dad was attached to the german embassy when the film came out in europe took all my girlfriends to see it show them the beauty of the country where jimi had played and stayed where the hippies stopped after leaving ibiza and before joining goa sean combs just celebrated at a friends restaurant in recently the el was much wilder in those days than it is now the stones went there earlier brian recorded in so it's memories and family entertainment and i'm glad my son will get to know about the north of africa watching this movie candice bergen looks beautiful and connery is pretty funny indeed and teddy roosevelt as played by brian keith quite impressive
<START> crackerjack is a hit and miss film set in the australian suburban lawn bowls club of mick plays a who has been scoring free parking spaces at when the club is put under pressure to install poker machines in it's premises they need to raise 8000 to keep this from happening the club needs new members to help and this is where mick character comes in and has to bowl to save the club with many up and coming and aging australian actors crackerjack is a hidden gem be warned though most of the jokes are for those with a knowledge of lawn bowls but there are many amusing sight gags that provide comical relief sam johnson and judith lucy co star overall the movie should be recommended for people who play lawn bowls or have played but there is enough other material in there for an amusing play if you have a slight understanding if you enjoy australian humour i suggest you get you're bowling whites on and head on out to the theatre because this is the premiere lawn bowls comedy of the year also the only one
<START> forget what i said about rachael ray is the most irritating personality on the food network and all of television if you've never seen 30 minute meals then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how unfathomably annoying she is i really truly meant that you can't even begin to be boggled by her until you've viewed the show once or twice and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you the problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot if you love something or think it's awesome a word she uses roughly 87 times per telecast just say it and she's constantly using horrible unfunny catchphrases like extra virgin olive oil shut up what's worse is ray has two other shows on the network i think this is some elaborate conspiracy by the terrorists to drive us mad give me more tyler florence ray is lame
<START> this was a fabulous premise based on lots of factual history but the serious lack of character development left us not really liking or caring about any of the characters especially the she did not get any sympathy she seems like she deserved his own black cloud the songs were great to a point but became repetitive after a while
<START> i went into this film really wanting to like it it headlined a film festival earlier in the year and boasted an all star cast but and you could tell there was a but coming it's a failure of a film outstanding character acting by sarandon and walken is destroyed by editing and the antics of the supporting cast turturro's performance is lackluster and most of the comedy is overplayed the recurring puppet shows are pointless and a few scenes are completely out of place br br that said there are some wonderful moments sprinkled in the film a genuinely touching stage moment several of the seductions and a few of the comedic color actually work out unfortunately they're overshadowed by the incoherent script and some bad acting
<START> when i first saw this show i thought to my self what is this its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered huge then there's sadie this complete misfit for her friends and well her family shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals like what is that also they made her another lizzie clone yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those shes also very perfect like most tv girls are which makes me sick so please this is a stupid show it makes no sense just skip it unless you liked lizzie mcguire or any other shows like that
<START> i saw it last week and the sketch about the korea towns was funny very tongue in cheek and suitable to the political climate full points to the writers and spike for that the part where he makes the translator pull a rickshaw and throws out korean words could have been pulled off only by spike this is a brave attempt by fox this is a brilliant show and i hope that it pulls off my wife and i have been it regularly and although it clashes it with a couple of other programs we watch it now on myspace i hope fox dedicates full resources to the show and makes it daily i can't wait to see bobby lee on his show with people like bernard behind the show this is on the right track also mary mae as his wife looks beautiful
<START> in cold mountain north colorado near to the period of the american civil war the reverend monroe donald sutherland arrives in the small town with his daughter the shy ada monroe nicole kidman due to health reasons ada meets the also shy jude law and they fall in love with each other with the beginning of the war becomes a soldier and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see ada in cold mountain again meanwhile ada meets ruby renÃ©e zellweger a survivor of the war who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend the story alternates present and past situations disclosing a beautiful romance i liked this film a lot having names such as philip seymour hoffman natalie portman and giovanni ribisi in the supporting cast a magnificent direction of anthony and seven indications to the oscar this movie does not disappoint my remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the dvd at least one of them which show what happens with sara her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm should not be deleted as it was my vote is nine br br title brazil
<START> some films are just plain silly beyond explanation this is one of them words cannot do justice to the wooden acting the stupid plotline and the ever predictable outcome about the only thing that makes this film halfway worth watching are the scantily clad women and the mute guy for you ladies in it the leader of the warrior women and valeria are quite appealing to the eye but that's about all this movie has going for it br br some silliness in point one scene when they start to journey to the lair of the dark one they are walking away from a supposedly destroyed land but we clearly see a 1980's new york behind them about 2 3rds of this movie looks like it was filmed in a high school basement the deadly sock puppets look about as scary as a sesame street monster i have to agree with in that many 1950's trash b movies did a better job than this about the only one i can think of that didn't was teenagers from outer space
<START> this is yet another pseudo intellectual let's make the nazis look real bad movie the nazis were pretty bad no doubt most of already know that however that does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good a discovery channel presentation of the conference would have been much more interesting br br conspiracy falls on its ass between two categories documentary and drama it doesn't cut it as a documentary the movie is too staged and the presentation too common it doesn't cut it as a drama the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily solved br br another thing is the tagline one of the greatest crimes against humanity was perpetrated in just over an hour as the movie shows the conference the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution the decision on the solution had already been taken by the ss the sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant commit themselves to an already established plan there were no decisions or plans made at the conference there was only threats and some needed less than others br br finally one thing the movie does show although in no exceptional manner is man has a tendency to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities this is seen in most leaders and politicians
<START> hell to pay bills itself as the rebirth of the classic western it succeeds as a western genre movie that the entire family could see and not unlike the films baby boomers experienced decades ago the good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad bo svenson stella stevens lee majors andrew excellent in this film tim thomerson and james drury are all great and it's fun to see them again james drury really shines in this one maybe even better than his days as the in a way hell to pay reminds me of those movies in the 60's where actors you know from so many shows make an appearance if you're of a certain age buck taylor peter brown and denny miller and william smith provide a wow factor because we seldom get to see these icons these days hell to pay features screen legends along with newer names in hollywood most notable in the cast of newbies is rachel who i've seen lately on the young and the restless and kevin who plays the angst ridden kirby a war weary man who's torn between wanting to live and let live or stepping in to do the right thing william gregory lee is excellent as chance mischievous and womanizing brother katie keane plays rachel sister a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive but giving up her pride in the process in a small but memorable role jeff davis plays mean joe a former confederate with a rather nasty mean streak i think we'll be seeing more of these fine actors in the future hell to pay is a fun movie with a great story to grab the popcorn we're west
