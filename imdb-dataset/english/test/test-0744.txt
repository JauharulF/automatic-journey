<START> how to round up every possible clichÃ© and stereotype existing in the genre of horror and then subsequently stuff them into one massively lousy movie the answer camp blood this is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a micro budget and a little bit too obvious inspired by friday the 13th four of the most intolerable teenage characters you'll ever see Â they're like a combination of ugly stupid and annoying Â go camping and quickly find themselves pursued by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit don't even ask me what the killer's motivations were or even who he she was because if it did feature in the film i totally missed it this is one of the worst movies ever made with no inspiration or craftsmanship whatsoever the production values were so pitiable that there are actors playing multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable the only half decent and worthwhile sequence throughout the whole of camp blood is the opening in which the impressively voluptuous meredith o'brien has sex in the woods with her geeky boy scout yes i'm fully aware that this is a totally shallow remark to make but then again this is a juvenile and retarded film so who cares
<START> what could have been a good story was destroyed by the ludicrous time travel scenario if something was altered in the past that changed evolution and humans never developed the time machine would never have been built if something from the past was brought into the present it would have no effect on the past br br i really wish film producers would run their ideas past an actual scientist before finishing the script even if you suspend reality and assume time travel is possible you have to stick to logic br br otoh ben kingsley seemed to be having a great time with his over the top performance all of the other actors seemed to be doing the best they could as well it was the writing that left them twisting in the wind br br back to the future handled it better
<START> i saw this film last night br br and i'm worried i'm turning into one of those left wing liberals they rightly make fun of in south park because i found it hugely offensive am i being ridiculously sensitive firstly there's the old staple that is america being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything ever br br secondly and chillingly there is the early meteor strike hitting some unnamed Â why do they need a name asian country the reaction to this is to look at it as a warning as in my god imagine the tragedy that could happen because you know it happened to asians it might happen to white americans and that would be tragic br br then later on a bigger meteor hits paris our cast on the ground are irritated because this might mean our boys have less time than they thought not much upset in america no mention that a lot of people have died br br then there's michael clarke duncan a wonderful actor wasted never has a black man been so token among a team of hardcore drillers his job seems to consist of standing in the back occasionally saying hey you da man really why did they even bring him it's not like he's petite he weighed down that shuttle for nothing not once does he lift a tool steer a space ship or even help fix anything that blows up br br even if you ignore the russian peter stormare another great actor wasted in a pointless role who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with instead of fixing them because how we do in russia it's pretty horrific br br all cemented of course by the site of blond blue eyed american children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant br br you expect the bad script the dodgy acting the implausible plot fat middle aged men being trained in 12 days to be astronauts including one who appears to be retarded but i couldn't believe the racism and xenophobia implied in the film and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone not corn fed american br br it's a chilling indictment of the attitude of a section of western society to the world br br and it's a crappy film too
<START> watched the director's cut last night glad it was free rental even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at film noir the anachronisms modern telephones were annoying to me not clever seeming more like budget constraints than anything else the non traditional casting i also found distracting if i have to stop following the story to wonder what the heck is the black chick drag queen doing there then the storyteller has failed me again not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating and very film school final project ish and for pete's sake if you are going to shoot in black and white at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color there was no use of nuance in the lighting no shades of gray no depth no texture just black and just white boring
<START> i must say this is easily one of my favorite movies to watch on halloween the halloween party the horrid acting the guy dressed like and extra from miami vice great great great br br spoilers br br i have a huge place in my heart for random 80's horror flicks and this one reached out and tugged at my heart strings i always passes this flick at blockbuster and always laughed at the cover of the box now every weekend i would grab a random movie i had never seen before one weekend it was turn she seemed to have been taunting me for months so i took it home put it in and spent most of the movie underneath the blanket br br for me it was terrifying and gross and not just the acting some of the things they came up with for this movie was amazing i can honestly say the best part for me was watching suzanne played by a fellow stick a tube of lipstick through her nipple it was random and i loved it watching creepy angela float through the hallways and hearing her creepy demon voice was enough to have me awake all night long br br it isn't one of the most clever or best acted horror movies but its 80's cheese and its got all the elements you need creepy goth kid virgin slut naked girls scary house bad acting oh and did i mention naked girls all the elements were there and were put together in such a way that made for one of my fave movies kudos to the filmmakers
<START> this is the one movie that represents all that is bad in the movie business the actors are pathetic and the script is awful the special effects if there are any are so badly done that it would have been better to do it with cartoons instead besides that it's great i think the creators of the movie meant it to have humor but the only time i was laughing was when i saw patrick s with long hair and the colorful costumes that every one had the scenes at the end were good but they were not a part of the movie in the end you will ask yourself why did i waste my time and money with that crap when i could have watched the plants growing or the clouds moving i don't think that i am some critic or anything but this is a truly lame movie do not watch danger of stupidity overload
<START> after the book i became very sad when i was watching the movie i am agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel but in this case it was more than acceptable some examples br br 1 why the ranks are different e g lt instead of sergeant etc br br 2 the final screen is very poor and makes as a soldier who feds up himself and wants to die but it is not true in 100 just read the book he was a bull dog in the last seconds as well he did not want to die by wrecking his gun and walking simply towards to michael noah br br so this is some kind of a happy end which does not fit at all for this movie
<START> i have no read the novel on which the kite runner is based my wife and daughter who did thought the movie fell a long way short of the book and i'm prepared to take their word for it but on its own the movie is good not great but good how accurately does it portray the havoc created by the soviet invasion of afghanistan how convincingly does it show the intolerant taliban regime that followed i'd rate it c on the first and b on the second the human story the afghan american who returned to the country to rescue the son of his childhood playmate is well done but it is on this count particularly that i'm told the book was far more convincing than the movie the most exciting part of the film however the kite contests in kabul and later a mini contest in california cannot have been equaled by the book i'd wager money on that
<START> arnold fans will holler in joy fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment and catholics will just holler br br illogically written by andrew w marlowe and ham handedly directed by peter end of days gets the terminator out of his open backed hospital gown arnold schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart operation whilst blowing things up in mysterious ways and biblical verse to give catholics something more to whine about br br it is 1999 and doom sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn even as the technological stank of y2k the new york streets ex cop turned alcoholic security guard jericho cane schwarzenegger with the perfunctory dead wife and kid back story for loose cannon effect must brave theological waters to save 20 year old virgin christine robin tunney from being conscripted as Â wait for it Â the bride of satan dun dah stupidity ensues br br for every anti hero there is his anti christ gabriel byrne is the devil here Â and he's out to party like it's 1999 on a mission to impregnate christine with the anti christ between 11 pm and 12 midnight december 31 1999 Â ironically in the hour that all porn will be lost Â thereby bringing about the end of days being able to read minds conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic it doesn't occur to satan to the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time instead he appears on december 28th like a keyser soze terminator and wonders why she doesn't welcome him with open see above comment re stupidity here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology a priest rod steiger tells jericho that is really upside down with a '1' in front of it so wait prince is the anti christ br br satan soze pursues jericho and christine j and c Â get it around town at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture in one scene satan recreates wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid christine but if he can see so deeply into mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia why can't he see where jericho hid christine not ten minutes ago br br satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue yet he can't make that assassin a semi automatic weapon and when jericho shoots satan at point blank range satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing so jericho won't worry unduly about satan's health not sanitary to go about with open bullet matter of fact instead of simply possessing jericho himself to get close to christine and rape her satan so much unnecessary energy on side projects the tongue less guy blowing up partner kevin pollak and then saving him and then blowing him up again ridiculously battling jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought that we wonder whether a more efficient assassin lover shouldn't be put on the case Â say antonio banderas br br what i find most precious about end of days is arnold's valiant attempts at the method sad means scrunching up his eyes and not out anything in a foreign accent depressed means raising a bottle to his lips and not out anything in a foreign accent deathly scared means widening his eyes and not out anything in a foreign accent there's definitely a pattern here if we could only decipher it br br in the end the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom catholics pray to for deliverance from such as these but from the atheist jericho while the timid men of an impotent god faith and quiver in their cells doing nothing about satan actually walking amongst them the prince of darkness is thwarted by a with a big gun and a foreign accent which clearly says something that catholics blindly refuse to hear that even if the devil were to exist those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall let alone act towards it further they might not truly want him defeated for only through his contrary does their god's existence become tenable br br for it is written in the book of revelations and the prince of darkness shall upon the earth without any solid game plan and impregnate a virgin on a date which won't have any significance until the calendar of the 1500s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the and the anno syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia by which time christians will have forgotten christ's actual birth date and appropriated the pagan festival in its stead and the prince shall effect a revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguously lesbian band i can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified and the alcoholic built like a mr universe i can believe that a giant supernatural monster can't kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent i can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century celtic druid ritual as foreplay but what i cannot believe is the 20 year old virgin in new york city in 1999 br br especially around prince
<START> i thought this movie was highly underrated the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange and i was put off at first but once i was watching the movie it didn't seem strange at all i was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer and i couldn't wait to find out how it would end once it did end i thought about it for a long time after i was pleased with everything about k pax from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues to the ending it's not an especially upbeat or happy film though it does make you chuckle from time to time but i found it to be especially entertaining and thought provoking i own it now and intend to watch it many times
<START> the only redeeming quality of this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in ny during as for the film itself it has at least three major flaws first of all there is narration throughout the film which is not required at all in the few places where there is some explanation necessary just adding a little dialogue would have gone a long way secondly there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the audio in fact it is quite apparent that most of the dialogue was recorded later with no attempt to match the film the third flaw was in the ending i will not give the ending away for those brave souls that would endure the torture of sitting through the film but it commits a cardinal sin in screenwriting not worth the money or time it takes to see this unless you are a fan of one of the represented bands
<START> last night i attended a screening of with my cousin we were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director writer the producer his wife and several cast members were also in attendance and that there would be a discussion and q a after the movie but once the movie was over and the credits started rolling and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long my cousin and i without consulting each other immediately got up and left we found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion we couldn't even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left br br i have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which jerry slices his daughter palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail it was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence sparing her and taking her with him when he fled i've sliced my palm before accidentally even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive and it is very slow to heal if you don't keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life but after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band aid it was as if she'd never been cut my anger reached its peak i won't spoil this moment for you in final scene br br i got angry because celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film the actress portraying her is a good one i you can't tell me a good screenwriter wouldn't know in feeling both her physical and emotional pain and the screenwriter by treating emotional pain so and with such disrespect also treated me the audience member and with utter disrespect br br sure the script has moments of tears for celina and some dialogue that tells us she's hurting somewhere somehow but by this time we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we've shut down the manipulation starts very early on in this movie when jerry's family's dialogue spells out for the audience that jerry had psychiatric problems rule one screenwriters give your audience some credit let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own tell the story don't explain to us everything we're supposed to think and feel we don't like it br br my cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on dialogue wise when jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides f this f that f you some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths but it's like watching comedians who curse a lot some of them are really funny the cursing is ancillary but some of them substitute cursing for humor and this screenwriter to carry the metaphor to its conclusion is no chris rock br br this husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters but they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story especially a complex one will vary for each member of the audience successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience br br i worked with vietnam veterans for five years i've heard more stories than most and i'm always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience it's important on all kinds of different levels that we hear them but i am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what jerry's story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand next time pay more attention to the details
<START> i rank opera as one of the better argento films plot holes and inconsistencies sure but i don't think they this film as much as many other reviewers seem to a lot of elements that are in many of argento's films are kinda off the wall but that's part of the draw of his films br br short story psycho stalks the new leading lady the typical argento twists and turns ensue leading up to a decent payoff of a climax not argento's best but i still pull this one out from time to time definitely worth a look if you like his other stuff just don't get this one mixed up with the abysmal phantom of the opera remake that argento did that one is truly awful 8 10
<START> mishima a life in four chapters is an art house biography about yukio mishima celebrated japanese writer who bears resemblance to paul schrader's earlier character travis bickle taxi driver both of them are lonely people searching for their place in their society and when they realize that world doesn't need them they try to destroy their surrounding universe br br if you want to learn about life of mishima then you won't find a lot of information here because it shows that he didn't live a very interesting life except for his final day but if you want to understand his personality then it is the best movie of its kind as most of the movie is adaptation of his novels and also provides a guide to his thoughts this movie shows that mishima was a person who witnessed the fall of japanese culture which he was very fond of and with his final act he tried to save traditions and prove to himself that he is a real warrior but he realized that as a person he was just a man with no power to change the events
<START> the movie doesn't take itself seriously and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody and your horror topped with extra cheese br br this film winks an eye at every horror fan and then gives them the finger it knows it sucks and because of that it's far and away the best of the child's play series br br it plays up the stoopid humor angle so well you find yourself doing more than just laughing at it but with it and trust me the whole time you're laughing it's laughing back br br
