<START> wow this was a great movie i just got it from the u s and it was worth all the money i gave for it this movie is one of the best movies for children i have ever seen maybe the best all you who like rainbow must see this 1 the first 7 minutes you can not believe what you see it's so great br br scooter
<START> would have won an razzie for the worst film in 2004 may be overall too if it were global when it comes acting badly aka showing attitude yawning over not acting halle berry is no match for while the catwoman had supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume and some action sequences had nothing at all br br one of those movies which makes me wonder why imdb does allow one to rate a movie as 0 10 yet again i think that movie does not even deserve a 0 it has to be something negative or minus infinity br br ok what about the plot outline it is a giving arrogant full of attitude choreographer meet an useless skill less loafer who aspires to be an actor tale the story is so short that if just another sentence imdb might ban me for writing a spoiler about the story telling its like a bunch sorry 2 people for the most part of people moving in super slow motion don't try this movie if you have bought new dvd player you would end up believing that either dvd is in bad shape or dvd player is struck not its fault at all br br at the end of it all you end up giving some credits to the director at least he realized that both and abhishek bachan at least at that time can't speak dialogues convincingly so there are not too many dialogues in this movie so you can at least sleep your way through the movie with some annoying noises from those song sequences br br do watch this movie if you are new to bollywood cinema once you have tolerated this movie you would be able to see any bollywood movie and enjoy it br br there can't be worse 3 hour torture than this
<START> is a tv movie so it's bound to be pretty dire especially as it's a supposed horror film this young girl is haunted by dreams as she arrives in a small town where there was a murder of a woman one year before she is amazed when everyone in the town thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl the townsfolk are amazed when she keeps entering dream like where she reveals accurate details about the murder and murderer because the police got it all wrong apparently thinking that they are in danger of being found out the murderers there are two of them start to hatch a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the real truth by this time you will have probably fallen asleep and why do the makers of the film have the making' machine on full throttle in the dream sequences
<START> i got encouraged to watch this film because i've heard good word of it it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone disturbing shocking all that jazz well i am disturbed because i spent money on it and i am shocked that something so god awful actually got released that's about it br br this is a supposed new look at charles manson's family of insane loser junkies and their murders but if this is a new look then it's probably new as in fresh and totally inept just watching it gave me a headache and i had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be br br i suppose i should say something about the plot but fact is it was so stupid and incoherent that i barely remember if there even was a plot at all there was something about a manson tape delivered to a radio dj or a tv producer then an hour of pointless random footage of the family in '69 then the polanski murders looking like a bad school play and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley i kid you not and then it ended thank god don't ask me to make any sense of that i'm just recalling what i saw the performances were terrible too and how difficult is it to make a convincing manson get a short skinny scrawny bloke put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him there's your manson but this manson doesn't even look right he just looks like uh a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on santa beard painted black br br or maybe that's what this film is actually about manson's family didn't make any sense so this film doesn't make any sense either it's symbolic yeah right i'm still so angry at spending money on this i stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage stay away from it it's not even worth renting br br ps the recent us tv production helter skelter got bad reviews here but i saw it last month i saw the 1976 original too and let me tell you compared to manson family that new helter skelter is brilliant and flawless and i was disappointed in it that's how bad manson family is it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect
<START> i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i recently found the prey in its original vhs 'big box' form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those films br br to be fair it started off ok with the killer stalking the clichÃ© teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch this film is basically a big fat clichÃ© and when the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back story of the killer i actually thought this was quite an original idea however the back story ends abruptly and shows us some stock footage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isn't shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer sort of like from the burning but better as for gore there isn't too much although there's an ok face squishing moment at the end br br overall i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess
<START> i think this movie is underrated to me it felt like a gulp of fresh air some people complain about the implausibility of the plot overlong sequences and lack of sex the latter being i believe the main reason for implausibility and how come there are no drunken teenagers talking dirty but it's just not their thing and good for them if they can't relate to the story the performances are great i'd really like to see more of the actors in other movies the emotions are genuine the whole unrequited love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety and it does give you the tingly feeling you expect to get from a good movie
<START> i first heard of begotten when a girlfriend of mine picked it up in a cult classics section of my local video retailer she knew i liked obscure artsy movies so i rented it and brought it home it sat on my tv for a couple of days and then i put it in the vcr just before going to bed i thought that maybe i'll see what it's like first then devote more time to it the next day what followed was that it actually woke me up i sat through the entire film and loved it after i went through the closing credits i watched it again only after you see the closing credits do you get an idea of who is who after you know that you can watch it again with renewed appreciation don't listen to the people that tear this movie apart it's not for everyone if you're someone that doesn't like reading subtitles than this movie isn't for you not that there are subtitles there's no dialog at all if you're someone that actually owns rush hour 2 then this movie isn't for you br br this movie is truly original and inspiring it does what other movies have never done it looks like nothing else and is bolder than just about everything out there from 1989 to the current date you can tell that everyone involved in the making of this movie truly love the art of what they do and understand what can be captured in cinema form br br if you're looking to be entertained then the movie isn't for you however it is pure escapism in some extreme way and in film form it's like someone attached wires to my head and taped one of my worst nightmares but this nightmare makes sense if you really sit and watch the images dissect the action of the actors and don't sit there noodling your guitar passively but watch and not blink br br people compare it to eraserhead but begotten is so much more i'm not joking when i say it is my favorite movie it's an important film visually stimulating mechanically inspiring and hypnotic one review i read about it is very true though no one will get through begotten without being marked
<START> the first time i saw this movie was on a flight between china and los angeles it was a real hoot and made the trip pass with much less discomfort than the normal 10 hour flight i tried to locate a copy of it without success until i discovered a copy for sale on ebay having now watched it twice i recommend it as good entertainment my only real criticisms are that the choice of english translation words for the subtitles is sub par even by normal standards also the subtitling is little to small blends into the movie too often and frequently travels too fast to read well
<START> i don't know how this movie has received so many positive comments one can call it artistic and beautifully filmed but those things don't make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual innuendos i wish i had not wasted my time to watch this movie rather than being biographical it was a poor excuse for promoting strange and lewd behavior it was just another hollywood attempt to convince us that that kind of life is normal and ok from the very beginning i asked my self what was the point of this movie and i continued watching hoping that it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same vein i am so glad i did not spend the money to see this in a theater
<START> there is nothing original humane or insightful in this film the acting is average images are amateurish the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic something close to a soap br br in 2 37 a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspense drama we watch partly because we want to know who dies the various characters each have a problem and the film shows how bad each problem is for them but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events there is never another way of seeing the events themselves so in 2 37 the arseholes are arseholes the angels are angels this is simple stuff br br without this complexity the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence you hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation br br in the end if you know anything about film in the last 5 years 2 37 is just an immature rip off of elephant not a meditation not a progression yet while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy they never talk about gus van sant or elephant the positive posts on imdb curiously avoid any mention of this or simply don't value originality if you do want something with heart and voice avoid this piece of youth exploitation i was surprised by the filmmakers age when i found out after seeing this film i had assumed a 13 year old had made it the twenty somethings i've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man
<START> queen of the damned is one of the best vampire movies i had ever seen the movie had suspense action and gore the combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the queen and the rock mood of our star very well acted by stuart townsend makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create i'm always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if queen of the damned is worthy i tell them it's worthy of buying this movie is most for sure a must have in all horror movie lovers' homes
<START> i think the lineage may run like this pay attention please because i had to look this up in 1967 peter yates an ex auto racer directs the english caper movie robbery the most thrilling part of which is a car chase through the streets of london down alleys where there are crowds of children playing and all that it's a success br br a year later yates directs bullet starring steve i mean mcqueen featuring another even more spectacular car chase up and down the san francisco hills with dumbfoundingly authentic engine sounds that seem to include double clutching full race cams no mufflers twelve cylinder engines under forty foot hoods supercharged and all five thousand horsepower running at full tilt lots of shots of mcqueen's gum chewing visage scowling with concentration as he tries to bump another car off the highway though a passenger in the other vehicle totes a shotgun the chase is staged by philip bill hopkins drives the criminal vehicle br br a year or two later sensing a good thing bill friedkin directs the french connection featuring a chase between a commandeered cop car gene hackman and an elevated train in new york city lots of shots of hackman's cursing face as he wrestles the battered car through the streets the chase is staged by philip academy awards follow br br sensing a good thing a year or two more brings us the seven ups featuring a chase between a car driven by roy scheider with lots of shots of scheider's cursing face as he tries to bump the other car which is driven by bill hopkins off the road although the criminal car to be sure carries a shotgun toting passenger no hills in new york city just bumps but they are still sharp enough to elevate the cars a few feet the pursued car screeches around a corner and dashes down a street on which a dozen children are playing shots of the screaming kids as they scatter off the pavement and allows the car to zoom through but once is not enough the children immediately run back into the street and must repeat the retreat for the pursuing cop car carrying scheider br br i once witnessed a pursuit at high speed on the streets of philadelphia both the criminal and the cops drove through the streets at about 25 miles an hour coming to rolling stops at each stop sign and red light very dull stuff compared to this movie br br speaking of this movie it's pretty good robbery and bullet were cool everyone dressed neatly but the new york movies are filthy there's garbage all over the place and the subway cars are covered with graffiti shoot outs and beat ups take place in vacant lots surrounded by crumbling brick buildings or in disposal dumps for industrial sized br br the acting is pretty good too roy scheider seems whippet sleek the other actors have faces made for the camera especially richard welsh and the story is engaging if not entirely unfamiliar what's best about the film is the way it captures new york city in its almost total indifference to human depravity and nobility at a funeral the limo drivers stand around with their collars up butts hanging out of their mouths kicking their cold feet together utterly bored at the ritual goings on the film wants us to believe that the seven ups are an elite group of untouchable cops who stop at nothing to get the job done and here it's a bit of a sell out they always seems to be threatening to do something unethical and illegal beat hell out of a suspect or physically damage a hospitalized and helpless hood but they always manage to avoid doing it if they actually did it their characters would become lifelike and ambiguous and we'd rather have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature very enjoyable even if you've seen it before and you very well may have in one or another of its previous incarnations
<START> at least one kind very human and moving not out to teach a lesson or anything like that all principals are effective i saw the movie years ago and still remember it but can't remember the morgan fairchild role br br and a nice slice of american life
<START> 1 stephen baldwin doesn't care about his involvement in stephen baldwin vehicles br br 2 the acting in any stephen baldwin vehicle ranges from horrible to mildly passable br br 3 writers don't write stephen baldwin vehicles children do br br 4 most of the stephen baldwin vehicles revolve around one genre the actionless action genre it basically consists of crappy action sequences made with little to no effort whatsoever br br 5 the director doesn't care about stephen baldwin vehicles he passes his job to an orangutan from time to time br br and now you know
<START> ok time for a bit of a rant i think it's been 2 flamin' years since i submitted my original comments praising this top rated comedy and the damn thing still hasn't made it to video or dvd or for that matter even been repeated on the telly br br does anyone out there know why not has there been a bbc style error whereby the original copy has been deleted wiped br br listen up you lot in charge of itv whack this on to dvd now do you even realise how funny this programme was it makes mike bassett look as bad as the current pants spurs team br br rant over for the moment
