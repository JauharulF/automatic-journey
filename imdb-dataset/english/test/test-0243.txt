<START> no doubt about it rampling is gorgeous a classic beauty here very young she manages to appear simultaneously sophisticated and poignant her two male foils act well too but seen in 2003 the flic is all br br american trying to be artsy and not be hollywood while shooting beautiful sh of the french riviera and three pretty young people in their cute old ca r i enjoyed the view both the actors and the nature but the movie is boring and pretentious while trying to be the opposite
<START> last week i watched a royal shakespeare company production of macbeth it was 25 years old filmed w no props except swords no furniture except chairs it was riveting the acting was super all the actors trained brits contrast that performance to this yawn yawn yawn al pacino as shylock was tragic heavy and couldn't quite lose the new yorker accent despite the long pauses between lines the whole thing was soporific even the comic scenes were barely even worth a smile let a lone a belly laugh this is supposed to be funny they tried to make it tragic it was neither just boring i give it four points for costumes scenery and jeremy irons who is good at playing a dull depressed deep voiced guy can he be anything else
<START> six students at a convent do the unthinkable kill a nun who was overbearing now eighteen years later the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder br br yea basically that's the short of it there's more to it than that but i still have no clue what it is the only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun as i was pretty impressed for being a more low budget flick i'm also confused as to whether or not it's in english most of the actors are italian and even the title here is in italian yet they spoke english in the film i think or it might've been dubbed i still can't tell br br anyway the real premise of the film is pretty idiotic and the ending not only doesn't make sense it well doesn't make sense
<START> the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who's a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep unfortunately he can't oh yeah and he's haunted by the memories of his mom and dad getting eaten by a megalodon when he was a child the guy meets some scientist whos pretty hot and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents now the shark in this movie is a really fake looking cgi shark basically this is sorta like shark attack 3 except more depressing if you don't get what i mean listen the film's opening credits show home movies of the main character when he was a child with his parents before they got killed and there's really sad and depressing piano music playing in the background you would expect to see a shark or something and you do a brief shadow of the cgi shark floats around every few seconds but that's just it also i don't remember one happy facial expression at all throughout the film's entire runtime a majority of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss where the story gets even more dull and all the characters the shark too die in the end i was thinking sabato would manage to kill the shark and manage to save himself and the girl but no they all die and the film ends with the shark all blown up and the submarine with sabato's crushed and burned body in it sinking into the abyss if you're a happy person and you don't enjoy being depressed then avoid this movie if you're the opposite then congratulations you found your movie
<START> rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star unfortunately her career is getting no where in danny mcguire's night club when one of her fellow dancers says she's going to enter a cover girl contest she decides to follow her dreams and enters she reminds the publisher of her grandma who he was deeply in love with many years ago but when she finds this success her boyfriend is not happy about it br br i had never seen rita before this and i am so glad i did she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress there are some good numbers in here not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to one thing i didn't like was gene kelly's character he should have supported his girlfriend but anyway that's perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie cover girl is a glorious fluffy film perfect escapism not everyone's ideal movie but a wonderful movie nonetheless due to rita hayworth's star power great movie truly impressed
<START> topless touch football a wet t shirt contest a raid this house has it all except a plot and good actors the film consists of several pranks and catfights between the h o t s girls and the bitchy pi house the dialouge is a scream and the soundtrack is sublimely brilliant over the past couple of months it's been popping up all over cable so do yourself a favor and watch out for it h o t s is so bad it's good
<START> i have read the 28 most recent comments by various people regarding this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim shown on the bed with the missing eyelids as the camera pans up and away from her face blinks yes blinks i recorded it as it came on hbo this past weekend and when i saw this i literally had to replay it several times focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that i was not seeing things of course after that it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with julian sands very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body face too bad
<START> first nick pearl harbor was bombed in 1941 not 1942 they didn't have to predict the bombing br br second did nobody notice these six industrialist lawyers whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time they were killed before the surgery took place third how the heck did lugosi get out of cabs without being seen fourth why did the japanese not just kill him instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look alike companion and his surgical kit fifth oh what's the use this movie has a few interesting moments in it but by the time they explain what's going on you'll probably have stopped watching if not you won't care
<START> a beautifully constructed and brilliantly acted comedy there is not a person in the cast who does not acquit himself or herself with hilarious distinction however the real star of the film is the unseen director frank oz who brings all the madcap sensibility and wit to this farce that he brought to miss piggy's encounters with kermit the frog this is a not to be missed film
<START> i watched this last nite with an open mind sorry to say it is still bad first the movie is too and you can't hear what people are saying the accents are bad especially richard what is the french chick doing in this film miscasting at its worst walken's makeup is strange the harvard scene is useless and not needed character is unlikeable and i wanted him to get killed and go away meanwhile the walken character gets killed too early and easily despite the makeup the settlers are all stupid get organized you bunch of hicks people are coming to kill you john hurts character provides some humor buts thats all br br i have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap the only good thing is it ruined the director's career and killed united artists br br still crap after all these years
<START> it's amazing that this no talent actor got all these well known stars to appear in this dismal pathetic cheesy and overlong film about a low life gangster who looks white but is half mexican much of the acting is bad and many of the well known stars in this trashy movie are given a script that seems made up by a 16 year old i'm sure this movie is the career low point for actors such as dunaway wagner keach tilly and busey who i'm sure are very embarrassed that they ever appeared in this turkey of a film i doubt many people have ever heard of and after this terrible movie i'm sure he will disappear into oblivion where he belongs
<START> i can't understand why many seem to hate this br br this movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties using set pieces props and costumes similar to those seen in other movies here however the story attempts to run through all of human history with a frame story about the human race being on trial with a guilty verdict meaning h bombs will go off all over the world the prosecutor is the devil played with fiendish glee by vincent price ok so it's a little hokey calling the defender the spirit of all men but i think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm the spririt of man is incidentally played quite well by ronald coleman in his last film it is also the last movie in which groucho harpo and chico marx all appear but not together groucho plays buying manhattan from the indians in a scene played purely for campy humor chico isn't funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat and harpo we are told is meant to be isaac newton discovering gravity most of the other performances are well done though br br other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space which is depicted as a region of clouds and there is something called the great clock of outer space which when striking midnight may signal the end of the world br br but at its heart the movie addresses the problems of and the eternal question of whether man is basically good or basically evil and poses it in what i think is an interesting way also anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie
<START> this movie reeks no money no acting no nothing i caught this on on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it this movie has nothing to recommend it i can't believe it ever got released to us television nobody in this movie can act their way out of a the lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face the special effects consist of a worm like monster i can't even begin to tell you how rock bottom this production is it looks like it cost maybe 50 000 to shoot but only because it is on 16mm and that is probably a generous estimate anyway i lost interest rapidly and had to settle for watching matlock reruns instead of finishing it that's how bad this movie is
<START> well this was the last pay per view event of the millennium and it ended the year and millennium right the huge story line of stephanie and hhh started right here at this event when steph turned on her dad vince mcmahon had a great match with hhh and this event is very good i give it a 9
<START> hi everyone oh boy this one is a lulu it has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in there are three bad guys who i guess are the stars of this they beat people up and chop people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people usual stuff br br the woman who is sending them on their missions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks it's sort of like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy she walks like she is balancing an egg on her head br br the wardrobe is 70s leisure style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse the bad novocain mouth woman wears red a silk frock perhaps or maybe just a windbreaker that is too big br br i actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense it lets us in on what happened earlier in the film br br the police officers are ok some bad some good all stupid except two the two bright ones could have worked again in hollywood br br the movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise the middle sucks the guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job he is like a 1940s character actor great voice br br this one is a bit too long the lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot it would have been easier to understand a bird br br her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker br br tom willett
