<START> i have never seen the tv series or the previous movies probably that's the reason why i didn't enjoy it much boring and just not funny sums it up nicely br br considering the budget the movie seemed to have it's embarrassing they couldn't do an even passable job br br we went to the cinema with no at all and the hope to see a somewhat funny movie that wouldn't be too taxing on the mind my friend fell asleep halfway through the movie and i spend the next 2 hours hoping that it would finally pick up a hope which died with the end credits
<START> i enjoyed the prequels and found the relationship between tucker and chan previously hilarious however was a re hash of the first two without the charm or humor i think i may have laughed once and it was during the tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible chan is always likable but he seemed tired in this film i was able to predict everything who the villain was who the girl was spoiler alert who the good guy turned bad guy was etc i hope to see more movies from tucker and chan in their separate endeavors but not in any more rush hour sequels it's just too tired i recommend a rental but not a purchase
<START> this is one of those strange self important self indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound it isn't instead it spouts cliches that try to pass for profundity typical is the scene where peter kelsey explains to protagonist and best friend adam brown how man starts life breast feeding then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend and finally his wife thus concluding ultimately that life sucks so deep we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life the universe etc during adam's travels through the mojave desert on foot he abruptly leaves l a the day of his wedding and his family friends and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket some characters are more entertaining than others the best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others the actor james kevin ward does some great impressions including nicholson popeye and several characters from the original star trek but once the interesting characters leave the screen we're stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound it's a long trip which drags in many places in fact it's the longest hour and a half movie i've ever seen and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while at all br br i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and clicking on the tv that'll learn me next time i'll try harder to sleep in
<START> this would have to rate as one of the worst films of all time the film screened at the italian film festival in melbourne australia after the screening not only did i want my money refunded i wanted the 1 5 wasted hours of my life back too i have a very broad tolerance level when it comes to the indulgences of some european film making but this is one of those films that is selected for festivals based on the reputation of the filmmaker alone this film is proof that while such selections may satisfy the egos of the film maker and the selection panel there is absolutely no joy for the audience there is no character development whatsoever the plot is a garbled mess the style is nonsensical the shot selection is appalling and the editing is worse by the end of the first reel you'll wonder if you walked into the wrong cinema and by the end of the third reel you'll be begging to be put out of your misery this film is an abomination
<START> is the longest running daily soap in germany and it's cult i started watching it from the first day on and i got hooked on it right from the start over the years so much has changed the old characters like elke tina etc left and new ones appeared like marie kai cora or john i have to say that i liked better in the years 1995 2000 because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters my favorite character is sonja because she is the most scheming person that has ever been on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show tina was great as the first sonja but as became the recast of sonja the character got even better
<START> i recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival where it ended up as one of the audience favorites this is a spoof on the french cottage industry of oss 117 films of the 50's and 60's the first oss 117 film based on the novel by jean bruce was brought to the screen in 1956 long before the first james bond film staring ivan desny as hubert de la bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to 1970 with luc frederick stafford kerwin matthews and john all taking turns as oss 117 jean is in the title role in this comedic take on the series as the film begins set in 1945 he has a french mustache and resembles desny but as the film begins it's setting of 1955 he really looks like sean connery jean franÃ§ois wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to egypt to investigate the murder of a friend it borrows on the silliness of naked gun get smart and the pink panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and i am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a revived oss 117 reworked to comedy adventures michel directs i would give this a 7 5 and recommend it
<START> i did not read the book nor do i care to the movie was a beautiful romance and i think women will enjoy it no it was not a 10 film but it was enjoyable women if your man is bored as mine was then watch it yourself hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on in love and loving br br also if you like nick cage he was terrific and funny i enjoyed watching the developing romance br br also if you like christian bale do see him in equilibrium this is a 10 sci fi movie br br do see this film ignore the previous user's comments br br one especially the ladies also do visit my website at my name as one word and a dot com
<START> as a sci fi movies fan i also like alien but pitch black is definitely better than alien 3 and alien resurrection it well into alien series but it isn't alien it's something else ok enough comparisons this movie but me think why people are afraid of dark you can't run away from dark it's impossible you have to be faced with darkness and with that what's in dark in this movie i also liked that the vin diesel character richard b riddick wasn't typical good boy he had a secrets and he has done bad things in the past to the other people he is a hero who tries to save them all first of all he want to get out of that planet himself there is also other metaphors in this story every big sci fi fan should see this picture
<START> i seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here but i really did not find this movie as scintillating as the reviews i read claimed it was no doubt a touching story and the partition background provided the scope for an epic but the movie was a let down specially for who has seen inspite of the lead being played by sunny deol and the incessant songs i must say gadar is the better of the two the story being virtually the same partition failed to create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that were supposed to hav an impact over looking kristin accent and the image which in itself wasn't an easy job the characters just did not seem too real not that i am criticizing the acting by any of the lead it just did not work the atmosphere was well drawn up but the movie really lacked in substance not that i am die hard rambo fan but some action have seen the movie through or some character development it all seemed like a rush to the finish and the ending only added to the viewers dissatisfaction br br i must say that it was at least a good effort in seemingly unfamiliar territory by the director and if u haven't seen gadar then u mite even like it
<START> i have watched this movie time and time and time again each time it makes me laugh it makes me think and it makes me cry robin does an incredible job of portraying marcy and i'm kind of glad that kate winslet and that other lady turned down her part its just one of those rolls that you know that no one else could have even compared br br its a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in crappy situations that team up together they stand beside each other no matter what even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways br br i'll tell you now its not for everyone out of everyone i've shown it to i'd say the results are 50 50 but if you like it you'll love it and want to share it with others 10 stars all the way
<START> this is the one major problem with this film along with a good deal of biggest movies done in a pretentious way by pretentious people br br it's really sad but big shots movie makers driving dodge stratus from this province believes they got the they know what the little people like br br we're not a rich province every time a big movie like this 30 millions is made it's cutting off a lot of others who won't see their movie made because of lack of governmental help so it generates mediocrity only movies from friends of the family are going to be made br br i sound angry and i am i went see nouvelle france expecting a journey in the lives of my ancestors but i found myself stuck in a pool of inconsistencies french accent we gotta please our cousins so f our language and lack of historical research is only a few add a campy love story and the same music score playing again and again and dumb viewer is gonna open up and ask for more i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of br br rent cruising bar instead and have a real good time br br ps i'll never forgive them for ruining such an awesome title
<START> alice enters in a world of wonder but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid the mad hatter the white rabbit the queen and others even and show alice some things about her body and other people's bodies that might be quite wonderful a tale of love and lust the likes you've never seen br br kristine debell appears as alice i must say by 1970s standards this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day i believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen my love for all things alice is no secret even better than fairy tales which isn't really pornography so much br br the songs are cheesy but fit the theme of the movie one song what's a girl like you doing on a knight like this was pretty funny and the others had similar themes going the trial towards the end was well scripted and fit very nicely into the world of alice the logic and humor were definitely accounted for br br what more can you say about a film like this all i know is for people who are used to adult films where it's just a 30 second lead in to the sex this one is going to overload you with plot and music but personally i think there's something very special about this film and i hope it gets a nice dvd release with things touched up and special features if that's even possible i can see this being a cult film
<START> is probably the word i'd use to try and start describing this film i only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was so let down br br basically the film is about racism in a post 9 11 america and the director went at it with a sledge hammer there was no subtlety in the film at all and it felt as though they were trying to achieve a kind of magnolia feel to the film which is never a good idea as that film was three hours of tedium and confusion only for it to start raining frogs at the end br br all in all a huge disappointment
<START> well this movie is really plumped haha get it thats kinda like the attitude of this movie the plot is just a copy of pulp fiction okay thats acceptable but to make this piece if plump haha is really unbelievable the storyline is so pathetic and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs it did try making a few jokes from various other movies and it failed most of the times i mean i do have a sense of humor but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh most of the supposedly funny moments are completely ironic the film is quiet short running at around 75 minutes overall they could have done a much funnier job seeming they made fun of a blockbuster film they were gambling and hey i think they lost br br in overall plump fiction is but you wont gather much at all br br worth watching over and over again no once is enough actually its more than enough br br so is it worth the rent ummm as i said its but you will only gather a few from it br br overall out of 10 a 4 out of 10
<START> i don't care if this show is suppose to be communicating profound messages about human existence br br the show is crap how can anyone derive pleasure from watching it yet it was received so well this reflects a sad state of affairs for joe moron out there br br i tried watching this program when it first came out as friends were talking about it the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to cry br br it is beyond belief that people can watch this show yet i guess the creators had the last laugh making themselves wealthy by taking the p ss out of the very people that would watch a show such as this br br i would wager they are laughing all the way to the bank
