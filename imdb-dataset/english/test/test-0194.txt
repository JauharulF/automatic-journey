<START> this movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie thought of two or three funny possibilities hired a good cast then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director the director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark artsy film weird camera angles blue filtered shots lingering close up looks at raindrops steve was good as always ben affleck was charming sweet almost shy he was perfect for a romantic comedy sandra bullock struggled along valiantly with a character who was supposed to be zany but whose wackiness consisted of things like madly kissing a husband she hated abandoning her child going on carnival rides offering to strip for money and a ride with a fellow airline passenger the script had very few funny lines there was no physical comedy it was boring it introduced potentially funny situations then cut them off before they could develop to top it all off the twist at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy if you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it as i did my advice is don't go to the movie it will only spoil a nice trailer
<START> this movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book as written by rafael this was a clean cut tale of piracy in the caribbean and it would have made a grand motion also it would have been very simple to make all the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island unfortunately the screen writers took the title from then threw the rest of the book away even the name of the main character was changed and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel it's a sad loss for one who loves a good sea story
<START> this movie had potential if it had been handled differently what it needed was a different director that's certain and perhaps a different leading lady i just can't understand the minnie driver character or at least how she played it she was completely unbelievable i cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either she was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do i am writing this as i am still watching it i'm thinking i would have hated to be in her shoes trying to 'act' something i didn't understand well we've just proceeded to the affair she begins with the son i'm still watching i'm now beginning to be profoundly embarrassed for everyone involved in this enterprise if you enjoy watching movies that miss their mark in a big way then watch this one
<START> had the league been unknowns pitching this script the backers would simply have turned around and said no you're not having the money this is dreadful as a fan of the league of gentlemen this is their poorest outing to date not particularly funny not particularly entertaining there are few laugh out loud moments they do exist but they are few and far between i felt the format was tired and really dragging the film refers to the writers being bored of the characters and it shows as for being a film i felt the xmas special had better production value the fx are generally pretty poor and it is clearly obvious that they didn't film in the original royston vasey they filmed this on the cheap in ireland the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible also the accents of the characters were largely off from their tv equivalents tubs and edward much underused again just didn't sound like themselves disappointing really because i was hoping for something far more entertaining this really was the equivalent of the 1970s comedies where the cast go to spain
<START> why why why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible horrible movie i still wake up in the morning and ask god why he didn't stopped me from seeing this revolting comedy i cant believe i paid to see this offense to my cinematographic taste i'm starting to think that the 5 stars it has is because of martha 's nudity and all the men who cant buy a porn film and avoid seeing this i will call it thing cause call it film is an insult to the mexican film industry the characters are a huge clichÃ© the acting causes involuntary laugh and the script is well i cant believe a human being wrote this and just when you thought you've been tortured enough the last half hour is so painful that i wished to ripped my eyes out the only good thing i can say about this abomination is that it only last 90 minutes that would feel like centuries but still really avoid the pain
<START> this movie is not worth seeing at least not at a cinema the story is hard to follow and understand it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier it's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just is so bad weird that it sometimes seems like it american sirens and lights on swedish police cars is just one example the acting of persbrandt and bergqvist is good as usual but i think jenny acting as jasmin acts very poor zara acts pretty well she's not been seen as an actor in swedish movies for a long time if you still want to see it wait until it's released on dvd or is shown on tv
<START> this movie is apparently intended for a young evangelical christian audience as a teaching tool for that i give it a 7 out of 10 point vote it's a decent movie to show a youth group but i don't think it will be very well received beyond that for any other audience i'd rate it lots lower br br the reviewers that saw it's a wonderful life in this were right on though i didn't think of that until they mentioned it i was more reminded of a chick tract those little 3 by 5 gospel comic books if jack chick ever made a movie out of one of his it would probably look a lot like second glance it has a strong christian message about the power of prayer and the influence each of us has on earth but it is somewhat hampered by christian stereotypes the christians are all very nice somewhat passive and squeaky clean while all of the non christians seem to be bad people br br muriel the angel plays a major part and he is the corniest cheesiest character in the film he is the most unlikeable angel i have ever seen in any movie and the biggest negative i don't know if the directors intended for his personality to come off so badly or if he just struck me that way i admit that he reminded me of someone i know dan's love for a very worldly girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question that i wish had been answered br br but the movie does display positive christian values and your youth group will be entertained as they view something wholesome with a good lesson
<START> based on a stephen king novel needful things provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your seat a mysterious man max von sydow comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen could it be that the devil himself has set up shop as an antique dealer in a small town in maine von sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen also starring are ed harris and bonnie bedelia harris is steady and bedelia is deserving of your attention also in support are j t walsh and amanda plummer not the best nor the worst adaptation of king's horror on the screen
<START> ok so this is horror i get horror but i don't get horrific black white is artistic but too much black is overkill enough said about the lighting the story a serial killer lot's of these around it's been done in the past and yes it will continue to be done but i hope not my question is when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma i guess the director thought he would do something different portray killing children well that's been done before too so i guess he had to go to shock value have them killed in the darkest of fashions okay the audience was shocked sickened disgusted numbed and getting up out of my seat i felt all of these things so was the director successful yes absolutely these are the things he wanted me to feel and i did now what do i do with the feelings and more importantly what is the message here with the amazing talent that francis xavier was gifted with could he ever consider applying it to making films that speak of dare i say coming out of the darkness i was left in the dark after viewing this film my soul was assaulted is that what this craft is about there are many such films out there they make the bucks i'm told so what's up with the people that want to see all these visuals what is going on in this world that people will pay to be horrifically shocked would i see this again not ever
<START> me and my roommate got free tickets for a pre screening i guess you would call it in atlanta ga at atlantic station walking in i was expecting something controversial provocative unnecessarily overdone etc but the film is much more than that it's a story of two people helping each other it's not overdone and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary br br it's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously thats the beauty of it if it tried to take itself seriously it would have failed miserably but instead it carries itself through humor some unintentional and some surprisingly good acting by ricci although timberlake fails miserably in his role the movie is good enough for you to put that on the side br br i would definitely recommend this movie if not for any other reason than the fact it is something different to experience
<START> due to its predictable second rate title the one it was distributed under in italy at least i didn't expect much from this movie thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house la casa means the cursed house well i had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene the constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres reminded me a bit of the exorcist and some of its decent italian rip offs but this was going to be something completely different this is more like hitchcock meets italian thriller very well written and directed good actors interesting plot ok i've tried not to spoil the viewing of 7 park for you which i'd highly recommend to everyone br br p s am i wrong or when joanna crawls or tries hard to stand she's paralyzed from the waist down her feet and legs move a little too much and i'm not talking of the bad dream sequence
<START> if ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper it would be this one here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft porn s m flick complete with the huge in theatre poster depicting a near naked christina ricci chained to none other than mr bad ass himself samuel jackson but let me tell you if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare it's craig redemptive follow up to hustle flow black snake moan br br unashamedly over the top from the get go this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper in with every subsequent frame it's yer basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move on in more positive ways with their lives been done before of course this tale but as i've always said it's the manner in which a story is told that gives it heart depth meaning and power br br ricci's damaged by childhood abuse wild child character rae and jackson's equally musician character lazarus find each other under desperate circumstances and laz takes it upon himself to try to help rae this in itself is relatively unique the idea of a man trying to genuinely help a woman who is in serious pain rather than trying to take further advantage of her and we know from the onset that heart and the film's heart is in the right place the movie at its core is about the redemptive healing power of love with music as a very close second and the film resonates profoundly with this truth soulfully artfully and brilliantly br br a major reason the film succeeds so profoundly is because of the fierce committed performances from ricci and jackson scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser artists' hands are instead powerful as all get out in particular the film's arc scene in which jackson sings and plays the song of the title alone in his house with ricci amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons from past running amok inside her head leading her to crawl to lazarus and cling to his leg comes off not ridiculous as technically it should but rather as gut wrenchingly cathartic br br all the supporting performances are fantastic here too justin timberlake is completely believable as anxiety ridden boyfriend ronnie and the always wonderful s is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for lazarus john jr is outstanding as well as reverend friend r l a nod to blues musician r l burnside no doubt everything works about this movie let's face it including the music soundtrack which features burnside scott bobby rush son house and most importantly jackson himself whose fantastic version of i am listening to as i compose this review there's also a really beautiful and moving version of this little light of mine featured in the film sung heart breakingly tentative and soft by ricci br br samuel jackson has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career thus far i could not agree with him more this is work that he can be monumentally proud of along with everyone else involved in this audacious supremely wise and deeply heartfelt mother of a project
<START> i can't really see how anyone can have any interest whatsoever in seeing this movie a woman meets a man he wants to play games she too but only until she realise what she's missing she leaves and that's it really it took 9 1 2 weeks before elizabeth kim basinger left john mickey rourke she should have left him after 30 minutes and ended our misery
<START> when this movie came out i had seen geena davis play only soft feminine roles this movie was anything but soft and feminine great lines great action she and samuel l really clicked too violent for the kiddies but if you and your significant other are trying to agree on a movie try this one on for size go geena go geena
<START> not quite a bomb the only thing missing was the enriched uranium actually the script may have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors but the dramatics of an aging diane lane acting as if she was a teenager or even a twenty something was too much to stomach every time she adrienne would jump into the arms of richard gere and then pull both heels up behind her you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he was probably thinking oh my aching back this babe sure doesn't weight 125 lbs anymore anyway both characters were distinctly unlikeable especially richard gere's a self absorbed plastic surgeon dr paul that was on some kind of soul quest after a botched operation left him with a dead patient an older woman from a small farm then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened dr is on his way to meet said angry husband at the husband's request when he meets up with adrienne she is recently split from her unfaithful husband shock and is helping out a friend by watching her beach front cottage rental of course that's where dr ends up staying and they both end up falling madly in love especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor and a plastic surgeon in between romantic interludes and a nauseating song dance routine that lane adrienne performs while listening to an old lp no cd's they both try to figure how their lives got so totally screwed up dr was also not much of a father and has a son who is also a dr who resents him for not being there for him while he was growing up naturally dr was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an impetuous distracting boy to make a long predictable story short adrienne helps dr face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table after going in for a routine removal of the face dr is finally able to tell the husband played excruciatingly sympathetic by scott glenn that he is sorry for what happened even though it was all the fault of that anesthesiologist i told him she was too old for that much juice glenn's character robert appears to accept dr apology it's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good dr at all or thinking about some that he needs to plow ever more circumspect dr then decides he needs to visit his son who is now practicing medicine pro bono in a third world country to mend their relationship unfortunately that means he must temporarily bid adieu to adrienne of course while entertaining the natives in timbuktu he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to adrienne who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye evidently apologizing to robert for his wife's death was the second hardest thing in the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide poetic justice as in mud pack and she is left with just the memories of what could have been hopefully no more gere lane sequels
