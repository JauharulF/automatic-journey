<START> it doesn't take balls to make fun of retarded people having to listen to mencia insist that he is brave to make retard jokes is intolerable also it doesn't take balls to bite off of the chapelle show the racial game shows the racial olympics it seems like a lot of the skits are merely reworked chapelle show skits that are just way less funny br br but the most irksome thing in the show is his insistence that he is just marching to the beat of his own drum when he is actually marching to the beat of many over worked over done drums that have been drummed many times br br i hate this show i hate that it presents itself as a voice for latin america br br and no carlos i am not trying to you if people like it then keep it on but i personally think that it's a bad show
<START> intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house lupino excellent as always threatened by a psychotic migrant ryan the 2 masters of the genre are at their heady erotic best as they match wits emotions and wills in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the saturday evening post richly hued b w photography with an unusual amount of close up head shots the young girl who teases ryan is really well directed here improbable but satisfying suburban melodrama
<START> this movie is a mystery it's not scary it's spooky you'll probably jump at some points and for some of it you'll be scratching your head to figure it out it unfolds its mystery through the main character eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum don he needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother and once eve agrees to help him she completely opens up pandora's box and unleashes some very strange things including i won't go into but i thought the way that played out was complete genius i know movie buffs won't regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesn't have anyone very famous in it angelina jolie's brother was excellent but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition but i do think the way the ending works is something to talk about i've recommended this to my friends definitely worth the purchase or rental price
<START> it is a rare and fine spectacle an allegory of death and that is neither preachy nor mawkish a work of mature and courageous insight northfork avoids arthouse distinction by refusing to belong to a kind unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison wim wenders' 1987 wings of desire der himmel Ã¼ber berlin it sustains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum spanning from the mundane to the supernatural this story of earthly and celestial eminent domains in the american west withholds the fairytale that marked its german predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels shedding their wings with obsequious sentimentalism its celestial transcendence be it inspired by doleful faith or impelled by a fever dream never parts ways with crud and rot this firm grounding to great credit for writers and directors mark and michael polish
<START> it's perfectly ok that people dies in an animation but there are just way too many death in this one start from the very beginning the story is all around battles fights death and revenge it goes on and on for entire one and a half hour it was interesting at the beginning but i grew very tire after before the show was half way through unlike other animations this one is lack of humor there are not many interactions between the characters either the good thing about it is the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice
<START> two of hollywood's great child stars elizabeth taylor and mickey rooney are perfectly teamed to deliver one of the all time family classics the story of a determined 12 year old girl whose adoration for horses won't allow her to turn away from her goal to win the british nationals mickey rooney is the newly orphaned drifter looking to tie himself over until he can follow his own dreams br br a beautiful side plot reveals that the girl's mother had ambitions of her own as a young girl repeatedly the father's decisions in favor of their spirited daughter it is mother who seems to know best the scene where the exhausted taylor rushes to go to school is priceless father protests why did you let her go to school she'll drop from exhaustion before noon not to worry she'd be back within a half hour it was saturday the brilliant technicolor the sumptuous music score and those beautiful faces all telling a bittersweet story here's a good reason for the old saying they don't like that anymore
<START> where do i start do i say how great the cinematography is do i praise certain scenes which show the directors creativity do i tell how realistic the scenes on ellis island are should i mention that for a change we do not have the clichÃ© scene of viewing statue of liberty by now immigrants viewing the statue from the ships railing is a clichÃ© br br now whats not likable two major things one being a modern song score not even a good one to boot br br second nearly deadly the film is boring it moves so slow that watching paint dry would be an improvement br br the minute running time is to long yet the film seems unfinished we see no scenes of this family in the us our hero mentions he wants to find his twin brother i would have enjoyed scenes of his futile of maybe lucky search instead of other drawn out scenes br br the film is a near miss br br ratings out of 4 81 points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10
<START> waco rules of engagement does a very good job of not drawing conclusions for its viewers it simply presents interviews footage from the standoff footage of the congressional hearings phone conversations expert testimony etc and allows you to draw your own conclusion br br i hardly intend to imply that the data presented here was done with 100 objectivity but it is very convincing you won't like any more after you see this than you did before but i tend to think that you will come to believe as i now do there is much that we were not told about what happened before and during the standoff
<START> based on a fairly bland best seller this film like most other lifetime movies played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie the only difference here was that meredith baxter wasn't in it the women in this don't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad br br the characters in this were all clichÃ© and one dimensional the story was of the cheesy nature i wouldn't recommend it but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great i only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to see it so she wouldn't have to read the book her sister loaned to her it wasn't made for someone like me my girlfriend cried a little at the end though so she didn't think it was as terrible as i did
<START> lights of new york was the first all talking feature film there had been of course the jazz singer released in oct 1927 as the first feature film incorporating synchronized dialog however this film released in july 1928 is virtually unremembered for its place in film history it had started out as a short but gradually more was tacked on until clocking in at 58 minutes it accidentally became the first all talking feature film it opened to a grind house run and to warner bros surprise made over a million dollars that was good money back in 1928 br br the plot is quite simple two country barbers naively buy into a barber shop on broadway that fronts as a speak easy for the hawk a gangster when they learn the truth they can't afford to get out because the younger barber eddie has all of his mother's money tied up in the place kitty is the younger girlfriend and gangster hawk wheeler has an eye for turning in his older girlfriend gladys for a newer model chorus girl kitty costello a cop is killed while trying to stop the hawk's men from unloading a shipment of bootleg liquor and the hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame eddie thus getting kitty for himself br br this early talkie is loads of fun for the enthusiast of these pioneering works sure the plot is elementary and the dialog stilted but there is something you don't see much of in early talkies background musical scoring vitaphone had originally been used for this very purpose and here they are still using it for musical accompaniment along with the dialog and there are singing and dancing numbers the scenes in hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show off what films could never do before musical numbers there is even a wild eyed emcee with some heavy makeup left over from the silent era that is a hoot to watch br br vitaphone could not go outdoors at this point due to the static camera so the scene in the park between the two lovers eddie and kitty is simulated and cheaply the greenery looks like something out of an ed wood movie or perhaps a high school production of our town br br gladys as the hawk's girlfriend delivers her lines with punch she's a real trooper considering what lines she has to deliver to the hawk so you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck huh mixed metaphors anyone and then there are her final lines i've lived and i've loved and i've lost did someone get paid to write this dialog was making a good success of her talkie career after scoring some triumphs in silent films the evil sister in seventh heaven when a fatal car accident cut her career short br br then there is eugene palette the older of the two barbers in our story his frog voice natural delivery of lines and cuddly appearance gave him a long career as a character actor usually appearing as a put upon family man businessman with a gruff exterior and heart of gold in fact mr palette is the only member of this cast who still has a notable career in films just three years after this movie is released br br finally there is the question of where is that microphone hidden microphones were still stationary at this point and it's fun to figure out where they've hidden it there is one famous scene though where everybody can pretty much figure it out hawk is in his office talking to his two henchman who seem to comprehend as slowly as they talk about taking eddie for a ride if you watch this scene you'd swear the phone on the desk is a character in this film it's front and center during the whole conversation the microphone is likely planted in the phone br br there is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in the face of the new technology of sound you have silent actors who are accustomed to using pantomime for expression vaudevillians who know how to play to a live audience but don't know how to make the same impression on a vitaphone camera booth and you have dialog writers either trying to write conversation as as they did title cards or filling up films with endless chatter br br check this one out it is not boring moves fast and is loads of fun if you know what to look for and no i don't expect this one to ever be out on blu ray but i hope that the folks at warner brothers add it to the warner archive soon so everyone can see it
<START> for my money probably the best film or at least the most purely cinematic film director ford ever made the dialog is swift clipped to the point l the story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits ford uses a relatively small cast but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions grimly realistic warmly amusing brilliantly acted hard to believe couldn't become a leading man after this with the best photography and editing in any american black and white film owes an awful lot to sergei eisenstein's editing technique but never as coolly detached or as eisenstein could frequently get and a great musical score a magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in american history br br one little quibble it's not clear why the film involves the mormons who as far as i know were never the pacifists the quakers and amish were this confusion leaves a slightly bitter after taste br br however the rest of the film is such a feast this is easy to ignore in all other ways a true masterpiece of american cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again and again and again
<START> everyone likes the coolly created memorable heist movie alain delon provides the antihero melville provides the cool and a handful of other great talent yves montand gian maria and andre mostly arrives to add a crisp engaging movie br br with very little dialog this is great because one certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialog involving the quick witted and their various repartees this movie however could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be missed not to say the sound is bad oh no the jazzy soundtrack and the crisp audio catching the little movements makes the slow patient deliberation of the patients very compelling br br what's also really neat about this film is that the color cinematography is pretty fantastic usually when it comes to cinematography black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind but this film has some very strong and beautiful imagery that makes the movie pure visual pleasure to observe br br polarisdib
<START> yes i am sentimental and yes i love movies where kids are the better humans true does have some logical or even plot shortcomings these are more than compensated by the kids' great acting julias first movie role at all and the charm of a dogma film i liked this kind of art long before the dogma ever since herzog's aus well i cried through the last fifteen minutes which is a higher tear factor than bambi or fly away home had for me
<START> this must be one of the most annoying arrogant poser films i've ever seen what a waste of budget and actors angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness it is clear there is virtually no plot even if this part of greek history is material for great movies he simply had some supposedly symbolic actually shambolic scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam along with and the like which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself a totally incoherent result which can only leave you saying huh or oh dear every two minutes br br there is no character development at all nada zilch i'm usually complaining about some movies having two dimensional characters but oh boy he managed to create one dimensional characters this is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors he even managed to make one of my favourite greek actors giorgos seem wooden br br and going to the core of angelopoulos film making no we're not idiots we do not want chewed food please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle theo do you really underestimate your audience so much or you're simply incompetent personally i think he tried to make a greek underground no matter how he tries he can't reach kusturica br br only saving grace photography costumes and the music
<START> i can see what this film was intending to do unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal the reality crime aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate in fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody sort of way notably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beat up woman the scene of the detectives going through the garbage and the father tying flies on occasion s few scenes bog down in too much dialog instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book but the real problem lies in the editing the story does not flow it fails to make a whole out of the sum of the parts in the end you are confused as to what is actually happening those who like this sort of detective movie like to follow along piecing together the puzzle at the same time the lead characters do with such poor editing it is difficult if not nearly impossible to do this
