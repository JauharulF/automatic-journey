<START> i first saw this movie with my fiancÃ©e many years after it came out i thought i would hate it but to my surprise it is so cheesy that it's great we've spent many hours reenacting parts of the movie sylvia yes mickey or i'm sorry you had to see that baby sometimes in this world we see things that we don't want to my cracks up every time i imitate neil also the music is classic and fun to sing along with especially on road trips of course i don't admit any of this to my male friends it's like a guilty pleasure i seriously watch dirty dancing once a month or more and it is just as good every time jennifer grey is also so cute in this movie its too bad her career never really took off
<START> i've been playing this movie incessantly this month and i just love it i was around in the 60s oh dear so it is nostalgic in one sense however it's the funny premise the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching br br dr winston's reactions to stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless i'd be more specific but don't want to spoil it for anyone who other than matthau can play a man not entirely on the up and up and yet have us still love him as for bergman's costumes i think she looks as dowdy as she's supposed to i think she was robbed the one time that she appears in an evening gown it doesn't suit her at all which is too bad i never liked it when i first saw it on her and i still don't br br goldie won an oscar for her role people thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time and yet it's the one performance that i don't love as much as the others she does have the right amount of sweetness and likability however which is important for this role br br and i agree i thought rick lenz was great in it and it's too bad that his movie career didn't take off after this br br i hope more people watch this movie they'll love it
<START> i think rosemary's baby is the most overrated horror film out there not scary interesting or much of anything it's reasonably well directed and ruth gordon was wonderful but that's about it but this sequel makes it look like gone with the wind br br i caught this on tv back when i was 14 unfortunately i still remember it from what i remember rosemary's baby andrew is now grown up and the coven wants him to start taking over the world that is but there are forces trying to stop it and andrew is having doubts himself br br i'm giving this a 2 for a few reasons gordon is in this and still very good stephen mchattie was actually pretty good as andrew and there is one spooky moment at the beginning with rosemary patty duke being kidnapped by a bus with no driver br br other than that it's dull silly and needless the original didn't need a sequel ira levin's book followup in 1999 wasn't much better br br tune in for the beginning with duke then tune out not worth the effort
<START> i saw this movie because every review i read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium i really don't understand what all of the hype was about for one thing the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad what if something strange is going on what the acting didn't blow my socks off either it could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with the characters are purely 2 dimensional to me and i didn't give a hoot about them at all another thing is that the movie extremely boring extremely sure there are a couple of jolts here and there but for the movie's 112 minute length it sure didn't use it's time up wisely most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot what was the point of that br br to top it off the movie makes no sense yes i believe i understood the intentions of the ghosts but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me also much of the movie is played out in little vignettes which makes the story hard to follow at times and don't even get me started with the ending what exactly happened there br br i can give kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film there are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images if they reflected more on those images and elaborated on them it would have made the movie much stronger but they didn't and instead elaborated more on social commentary which was interesting but again portrayed in an extremely dull way yes it's a message movie okay fun i'll just get the message of my review right out here in the open find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this
<START> critics have started calling it the oscar winner club understandably what after halle berry won it for monsters ball then going straight to the diabolical catwoman hilary swank triumphs in boys don't cry and follows it with the core jamie foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull stealth after scooping a gong for ray now it's seems hollywood starlet charlize theron craps all over her monster oscar with this one of the worst sci fi spectacles ever made br br the film loses its audience interest after a mere 20 minutes meaning the only thing really worth staying for is the fact that despite the film being rubbish charlize theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a crude and laughable premise not only is flux ultimately shallow but for an action flick it's also really very dull it will only really appeal to comic book fans and teenagers who like the idea of theron running around half naked for 90 minutes flux only really succeed in failing br br set against the virus that kills 99 of the world's populace and in the last city on earth the survivors some four hundred years later in the year are continuing to live in the dynasty the name of the scientist who developed its cure br br all is not well in this utopia and it is not what lies beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the never ending jungle but what unspoken unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unwritten taboo that holds and binds these together that lies within these walls of paranoia conformity and unquestionable obedience filmed in and around berlin ironically this is a story set against a totalitarian state a walled city where its peoples are no longer capable of reproducing and its sinister and most secret plot of how it sustains life br br flux is the assassin that has been assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of mankind forever this is the story of her fight for justice freedom and revenge br br flux combined lousy narratives pacing and truly dire effects looking more like an unrealistic video game rather than a film the only thing that is fortunate about the failure is that no sequels are in the works flux might just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history thank god for the lousy box office then br br my final verdict on this truly lousy feature there really isn't a story here just charlize theron jumping around in a black suit like a grass hopper the acting is very wooden moronic and emotionless compared to the other cinemas that are out there today it try's too much to be like an adaption and doesn't really take much from the cartoon which is what i was expecting the only thing that was done half right that pays tribute to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene avoid at all costs
<START> it has been widely agreed that hayao miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters his movies from nausicaa totoro kiki laputa and mononoke to the recent howl's moving castle are all not only gorgeously rendered in terms of art but in terms of movie making as well can this man do no wrong not really but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels his newest film an unashamedly family friendly tale of a goldfish out of water is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect and yet this is the first film of his which treads into lesser territory don't get me wrong is not a bad movie by any means as mentioned it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as totoro and kiki the problem is that the story doesn't stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing in depth plot br br for its opening hour is miyazaki storytelling at its finest in which a rowdy and young goldfish who later becomes named makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named modeled interestingly after the director's own son this does not please father a mysterious wizard named fujimoto who is very angry at the humans for their destruction of the sea this environmentalist theme is not much different from miyazaki's other films a problem he very much intends to rectify by creating jellyfish from the of his submarine he separates the pair and tries to talk into staying underwater with him the goldfish however has already tasted both blood healing a cut on his finger and some of the human food ham which she becomes inexplicably addicted to and of course steals into her father's forbidden potions transforming into a hyperactive young girl who is the spitting image of mei from my neighbor totoro this triggers a dangerous tsunami which threatens to engulf the entire world with water conspiring with his wife gran a diaphanous sea goddess who shifts from super sized titan to human size form fujimoto decides to test the two love for each other they do this by elevating the sea to the level of house prompting the youngsters to set out across their now ocean infested world in an over sized toy boat made possible by own magical powers br br it is at this point where begins to run out of steam although and are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute they slow down the film where the film really takes on water unfortunately is at the climax in which must prove his love to presented in a way which is strangely anticlimactic and rushed bringing an otherwise charming tale to an abrupt halt this will likely viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting finales for many of his other movies remember the destruction of laputa search for little mei kiki's rescue of fight with curtis the rescue of the forest spirit's head or even the test between chihiro and all those resolutions were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this one br br on a technical level cannot be faulted the animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at produced entirely without a single shot of computer generated imagery and naturally joe hisaishi provides us with yet another breathtaking musical score the best moments being the rousing sequences underwater accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice and the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as any other ghibli movies br br having proved themselves worthy on translating and dubbing previous movies into english with top quality results disney studios and pixar once again provide an english dub complete with a mostly capable cast of actors frankie jonas is surprisingly good as sounding very natural and believable throughout noah cyrus as on the other hand sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before eventually settling down toward the end leads aside the rest of the cast includes liam neeson as the overprotective fujimoto who manages himself unsurprisingly well in the character cate blanchett as gran in an omnipresent tone which is not much different from her galadriel in lord of the rings matt damon as constantly seafaring father koichi who is good but nothing to write home about and tina fey as lisa of them fey is the best voice in the entire cast imbuing the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality her scenes with show real chemistry on the other hand cloris leachman who was spectacular as dola in castle in the sky is disappointingly wasted as one of three handicapped elderly women she barely has any lines who are also voiced by betty white and lily tomlin of them only character a cantankerous woman named shows any real personality but if i were casting the movie i'd switch tomlin with leachman probably the only really jarring drawback of the dub is a techno remix of the film's catchy but ridiculously repetitive title song which thankfully doesn't occur until midway through the closing credits br br on the whole is a good film a fine piece of animated work which is perfect for youngsters and family audiences due to the loss of momentum toward the end though it falls far short of classic status since miyazaki at his least is still better than a majority of other animated films though i'll be generous and give a full star recommendation because any feature of his is still very much worth watching particularly on the big screen be sure to catch it in the theaters while you can
<START> an evil spirit takes over a girl and diffuses panic in the louvre museum that's all i think the summary of the movie and the movie itself which i think it's one of the worst french or non french movies ever made in the history of cinema br br nothing good in here except the music of the credits only some tender moments of sophie and of course the movie's finale shot not because it ends ages of what seemed to be a countless years we had in watching that crap but also for being so perfect as one magical c g i work that was too good to be true in here br br by the way i want to change the plot summary to be like this an evil spirit takes over some cinema artists to make lousy movies just like this one for sure
<START> i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success at least he'd have wound up with something br br the film struck me as pointless rambling and very stylish like some other recent french films not to knock it most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever we should be grateful i suppose for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a wind blown continental winter and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's up br br but there can be too much of a good thing golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood you'll love it if you're vlad the impaler lots of people die catherine deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle i don't know why young girl dies too and i don't know why she dies either she gets slapped in the face falls to the pavement and dies br br there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too i'll have to take their word for it because although it is stylishly photographed it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness don't worry about the kiddies being shocked they'll probably be asleep by this time anyway br br depardieu isn't a bad actor as we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man well handsome except that his nose can't seem to get out of his way to a limping murderous hairy physical wreck we feel sorry for the guy golubeva has a wan pretty face with enormous half eyes and wide cheeks like a doll her next movie should be a remake of lewton's i walked with a zombie then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band i guess it's a band as far as i could make out the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but listeners fond of easy listening might not enjoy it if you don't like the music there's a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with depardieu's walking stick br br i must say i found it barely worth sitting through and it's a too at times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by sometimes stopping entirely i wish it had had a few jokes
<START> great movie post apocalyptic films kick ass this one is no exception kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue mainly through some good character development the fight between reno and the hero was tight i also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and the connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey that is i had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence in sum kick ass character progression design story without the cushion of dialogue and most importantly the always appreciated desolate scenery of a post apocalyptic wasteland
<START> a good script or director couldn't fix br br the original adventure' was a story of human courage triumphing against terrific odds and personal tragedy the survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength who would take anything god threw at him br br the follow up tries to recreate the mix but fails through a formulaic script and pedestrian direction irwin allen may have been a great producer of disaster flicks and done a fine job directing the action scenes in but he just can't bring any human depth to his characters if the characters aren't credible any danger they face also falls flat br br the script also tries to copy the original too obviously so we have peter boyle doing the ernest borgnine thing by being tough and obnoxious but he has a tender heart karl malden is the red buttons influence and is terminally ill for good measure slim pickens does the comic relief for shelley winters and so on br br to make the story more contemporary we have a rogue arms dealer ready to flog weapons grade plutonium to the highest bidder a really nasty piece of work who ruthlessly abandons wounded men the actors playing his henchmen were presumably paid as extras because they don't seem to have any lines and has a woman shot in the back what a cad thank goodness the french rescue services made the hole in the hull twice as large as in 1972 and on the other side of the propeller shaft so he could he get his goods out and while we're on the subject how did they get the crates to the oh forget it br br i actually paid good money to see this when it was released given the film's current reputation this may seem odd but it actually got quite mixed reviews at the time some said it was junk some said it was as exciting as the original never mind nobody can be right all the time
<START> not your everyday tom and jerry short for many reasons one there's a voiceover narration by jerry which is odd because tom and jerry rarely speak two the two are friends which was also rare and seldom works as well as the more adversarial shorts do third and most importantly the cartoon is rarely humorous by design and the jokes here are dry chuckles with a little cough and a bubble of blood at the end think a tom and jerry cartoon directed by tim burton not wholly successful but it largely does work the creepiest ending for an mgm short that i can recall not for everyone and proof that these shorts were never intended solely with children as the target audience well worth watching recommended with the caveats above
<START> my girls 4 and 6 love this show we stumbled across it on a pbs station and they always ask when its on now it reminds them of their grandma that takes care of them everyday in the summer its funny too and sometimes they can't stopped talking about one scene or another i would definitely recommend this show to all young kids it is very clean and shows you to slow down and its not about watching tv all day long when nana reads a story it is slow and she talks about each page with mona it reminds me to slow down when i read the next book to my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of going through it quickly just to get them to sleep
<START> i appear to be in the minority but i thought radio was pretty awful it seemed to contain almost every cliche in these types of heartwarming movies br br the motivation for the characters falling in love with radio was never really explained we were just supposed to accept that everyone was fond of radio except for a couple of bad apples br br you could see almost all of th big moments in the story from 100 yards away when the movie wanted you to go awww or pull out your tissue i was rolling my eyes and wished i was watching rudy instead br br there were some good performances by the cast too bad they weren't given a better movie in wish to appear
<START> i love foreign films and this is among the best i tend to not see this as a comedy as it is listed and find it a commentary on how we see others around us the lead in the film is not regarded must as she is a domestic in a large firm and people say and do things around her all the time that they otherwise would not say in front of others br br this leaves her with a bevy of information that can make or break the mere mortal this actress is wonderful as this character and it is a poignant tale there is an underlying tale and almost many stories within the story in this film i just hope that if someone does decide to make an american english version of this film it is not the vein of three men and a baby that would definitely do a disservice to this film a must see
<START> hysterically painful perhaps the kind of movie chekhov would have made had he made movies what's really funny is that the two cousins have so very much in common many descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrong br br what's really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they just can't bring themselves to talk to each other or anyone else it's horrible if you've ever been too shy worried self involved or just plain scared to talk to someone and who hasn't you'll definitely see yourself in this film and it won't be pretty br br it holds a mirror up to the audience and says if you don't like what you see change it
