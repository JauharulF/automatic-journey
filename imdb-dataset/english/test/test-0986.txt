<START> set in 1945 follows a failed swedish book editor who decides to take a non stop train to berlin unfortunately for everyone around him he's a walking disaster causing mayhem everywhere he goes the train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man's wife who's also on the train a soldier on his way home two gay elderly gentlemen an angry train conductor two nuns a bunch of refugees and even more people br br meant as a mix of noir ish thriller which it does quite well at least to begin with and comedy the film fails with both it doesn't sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene and as the train races towards its final destination the film turns more and more bizarre ending on a truly surreal note br br the good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters is packed with famous swedish actors no matter how small the part is it feels like the filmmakers rang everyone they've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script act your lines don't read them br br the comedy is more or less slapstick with the same jokes repeated over and over the pace is incredibly slow at times quite often actually with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason the screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue the film looks great though in moody b w but it's wasted on such inept film making in every other department 1 10
<START> the only print of i've been able to find was abysmal i almost couldn't watch it which is a shame as this is among the greatest films the story which i believe had been done before and since by other japanese directors is a bit straighter than my favorite films the bailiff and and is essentially a tale of tragic romance in this case a transgressive romance that crosses strict class boundaries as always with there is an exquisitely expressed tone of defiance and bad print aside i was very pleased as with all of films i'm eagerly awaiting a restored dvd release whenever that may come
<START> i this on turner classic just because it was pre code and sounded interesting when i got around to watching i noticed that the critique gave it one and a half stars on a four star scale i started watching with trepidation even old movies can be bad movies but i quickly got engaged in the story and mary performance as the business brains behind a simple salesman's rise to success not a truly great movie too predictable but certainly better than advertised and i would have liked to have seen more of ricardo cortez as the man who appreciates mary but won't give up his wealthy wife i'd recommend giving it a look just to appreciate astor and what a long way we've come baby
<START> this is truly without exaggerating one of the worst slasher movies ever made i know it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by friday the 13th the prey copies the fore mentioned movie in many aspects the woods setting the killer the dumb teens the gore etc br br but the prey is as bad as you might expect i didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence br br well the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason the situations rather boring and lack of tension gore violence etc it just does not works for a slasher flick br br the acting is simply horrid the score is horrible a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80's tunes i won't even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me it seems that it cost only 20 dollars br br please avoid this one like the plague it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen and that's something to say thank god it seems to have vanished from earth
<START> horror genius dario argento is one of my personal favorite directors and his films suspiria phenomena and profondo rosso range high on my personal all time favorite list opera of 1987 is yet another tantalizing and brilliant film that no horror lover can afford to miss and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end this stunning and ultra violent giallo could well be described as the master's nastiest film which is quite something considering that argento's films are not exactly known for the of their violence the violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes opera a film censor's nightmare br br warning spoilers ahead br br just when betty christina a young opera singer is becoming successful a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts stalking her the murders are truly brutal and of particularly sadistic nature the killer attaches needles to the tied up betty's eyelids so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in abhorrent ways when done with the butchering the killer releases betty and leaves just to come back for other friends of hers br br as usual for argento's films the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized opera truly is a brutal film and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is this film is absolutely tantalizing and pure suspense from the beginning to the end the performances are entirely very good especially christina is brilliant in the lead a stunning beauty and great actress alike fits perfectly in her role of the talented singer whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly making her crazy other great performances include those of ian charleston as a horror film director who is directing an opera and director argento's real life girlfriend daria who has a role in many of his movies the camera work is excellent as in all argento films and the huge opera house is an excellent setting that contributes a lot both to the film's beauty and its permanently creepy atmosphere the score which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal is great too even though i slightly missed brilliant progressive rock soundtracks that are such a distinguishing element of most other argento movies opera truly is a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking giallo experience this is an absolute must see for any horror lover and i highly recommend it to any other film fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence excellent and absolutely tantalizing
<START> when watching this movie with it's deterministic cause and effect wall to wall clichÃ©s and hackneyed sentiment can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how barrie's life played out you watch it in a posture of disagreement hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics if hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all explaining simplistic backstory your story would resemble rocky because it's the only life arc hollywood knows how to produce anymore we couldn't leave the audience pondering anything left open ended as they exit this movie doesn't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them i perceived the captain hook mother reference eons before the movie it for me i could see the 25 kids twist coming for days br br this is a completely average movie not horrible but not great hence it's likely to be showered with a few oscars next year there's nothing the academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years br br from the new yorker article lost boys by anthony lane br br arthur davies also adored his boys and it may be unfair of finding neverland to omit him for streamlining purposes from the scene by the time that johnny depp meets kate winslet she is already a widow whereas arthur was very much alive when barrie first entered the little by little the the davies family br br finding neverland is a weepie from the moment that barrie met george and jack and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal the story is sad but the reality is even more dismal davies dies from cancer of the jaw dies of lung cancer the five boys are orphaned barrie is made their guardian is killed in the first world war fighting with his regiment in flanders an undergraduate at oxford is drowned while swimming with a friend the two bodies when recovered are found clinging together br br on april 5 1960 peter davies by then an esteemed publisher threw himself under a subway train in london we should not presume to read a mind in torment but we may note in passing that if he had lived another month he would have reached the centenary of barrie's birth and thus one imagines a fresh flurry of interest in peter pan Â that terrible masterpiece in the words of peter davies
<START> the australian public and the australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great aussie films around or that they are all the same br br well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other australian films it is unique it will make you laugh out loud it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself br br the casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none the script and the photography colour light etc is wonderful but more important this is a great film i don't want to talk about the plot as i think it is always best to see a film knowing as little about it as possible suffice to say this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences take your girlfriend take your mum take your friends for a great evening out br br 10 10
<START> after seeing meredith in beyond the prairie i had to buy another film with her staring i cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick it's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on meredith as she moves across the screen save your money until the tv network comes out with a dvd on beyond the prairie it's worth it at any price this one needs to pay you to see br br this pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman perhaps some of her latest might fit but i haven't seen them she has the smile of a cathrine bell and eyes of dana delany with a much younger body br br
<START> i have just seen today you die it is bad almost very bad br br 1 the direction and editing are awful just awful almost made me turn off the movie the director has no idea what he is doing he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all also i hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times pretty bad br br 2 the dialogue is sometimes good sometimes awful i like the fact that they wanted to make seagal's character and character seem like they were in a similar relationship to the characters in lethal weapon but it did not work simply because some of the dialogue did not make sense and i speak english very well it's not that i did not understand the words it was the fact that the jokes and dialogue lines had no meaning whatsoever br br 3 the script is pretty bad why do they always try to complicate dtv action movies seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities why is it useful to the movie no seagal eliminates a whole bunch of people who work for the guy who betrayed him and he knows these people without having ever met them in the movie stupid the story sometimes goes off track and the jumps back without any reason the story is messy and pointless sometimes they should have kept it simple and it would have worked br br 4 in some of the action scenes it is not seagal it is his stunt double you can tell because they only film him from behind and never show his face he also beats the guys with movie martial arts not real ones like the aikido steven knows the stunt double uses cheesy kicks and punches br br 5 steven is good in the movie 90 95 of the lines are said with his real voice the rest is dubbing but it is not that bad this was good also steven seems to be enjoying himself in the movie and is more into the action that he was in submerged he likes as a partner at least he does not seem to dislike him also he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent movies i hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body but in the same clothes that he wears on the dvd cover he looks more than ok and he should have wore those clothes for most of the movie not the stupid long leather coat br br i really think that seagal was willing to make a good movie the fact that he came late and took off early from the set on two movies directed by does not look like a coincidence to me i think he realized that the crew were amateurs or only in it for a quick buck and he did not give a damn anymore br br in the hands of a better company and crew this might have been a damn good action movie for seagal something like out for justice or above the law i honestly believe that but the people who made the movie are not very good at their jobs or they did not have enough money to do the job properly too bad since i liked steven in the movie and was cool ice cool too but the rest was bad hey at least this gives me hope for black dawn and shadows of the past i think that mercenary might be just as badly handled but hey steven seemed to be back into the same mood he was in while making his better movies and at least that is reason enough to watch the movie br br i liked it but it could have been so much better 4 10
<START> i didn't like underdog i mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it would have been maybe passable but for the main part i didn't like it this wasn't like any other kid movie its one of those movies that wanted parents who grew up watching the cartoon to come with there kids to come see this i am neither of them so the film didn't appeal to me in the slightest i had some problems with it like i don't think jason lee was the right voice for underdog it made it him sound sloppy and really unintelligent then it was really predictable which makes you feel tired and mad the humor was really what made me mad it was just to unfunny and somewhat pathetic the one thing that bothered me the most thought was how almost everything out of mouth was sarcastic or rude the acting was passable but needed a little improvement if you have kids they might enjoy it but if your not a kid by all means see it you might like it unlike me 3 4 stars out of 10
<START> this movie was recommended to me by some academics from their comments i had some pretty lofty expectations but this movie was nothing but disappointing the aim of the director is obvious to use an interweaving of speeches poems as a way to argue against the bush doctrine but the director fails miserably at this also i seriously question the director's choice of main character it's a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard the rise of corporation power so what most importantly this movie gets a failing score in its persuasive power it's clearly intended for those who've already formed their opinions it's true that the movie's aesthetics are quite pleasing but pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks
<START> i have done some research on ed and i have found a few interesting things like the fact that ed was quiet and a loner not some buff over bearing jerk as in this movie i will say that i didn't finish this movie but i will i will cringe through the fact that all of us talk like we are from you know the funny but oh so sad factor in this movie is wisconsin isn't as hot as they made it look br br this movie is not only an insult to wisconsin people being a myself but it is a complete insult to a man that was proved to be an insane lonely man he killed two people and the movie couldn't even get that right ed didn't get that close and personal and scare people he shot the two and only people he killed so why do these movies lie and say based on a true story this is not based on nothing but the lies the director came up with in his foul head br br a joke and nothing more br br ok i would like to add on to this i did finish this oh so sad movie and i personal would like to laugh at the director do your homework when making a movie i would like to inform you that there are no mountains for those who have never been in wisconsin and oh there is no desert what the hell there was more pine trees and snow in ravenous and that was suppose to be shot in br br ok for those who know nothing about ed gein i would like to give you your history lesson ed gein was thought to have killed his family but it was never proved he killed a bartender she was shot at bar close when no one was around he took the dead bartender back to his house 10 years later he shot and killed the store clerk he the cash register and the store truck he was caught because of this murder he came in the day before when her son was there and asked about antifreeze the day he killed her he was in there buying the antifreeze and the that only had was the only evidence they had to start a world wide man hunt he robbed graves in fact in robbed 56 graves he hate the people he dug up and he made lamp shades couches chairs and other things br br he had a family that he had dinner with once and awhile and they threw all the meat he ever gave them out when he was caught considering he was caught at their house he was arrested and hid in the back of a cop car in fear of what may happen to him how do i know all of this i read the book the judge that tried him wrote br br after this movie was over after watching the whole horrific thing not only am i offended by the directors view on what wisconsin women look like i mean it was hard to tell who this guy had on the slab half the time you know cause wisconsin women are all blondes please i am overly offended by the lack of homework this guy did and the poor job he did making this movie i have no idea who this kane guy is and i think he may be ok in something else but he did a horrible job playing ed gein br br after all of this i am so sad i wasted the 3 99 on the movie br br movie after finished was completely untrue this movie is like me saying that the world is flat and george washington wasn't our first president come on people that is your history and this is history to end this rant how would all of you feel if i made a movie and george washington looked like brad pitt some of you may think that is fine but it would be not true and he lived and wasn't the president and whatever you can't rewrite history
<START> at the beginning of we're introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters to make matters even more confusing we're informed via titles on the screen that the action is taking place in three separate time lines between the years 1999 and 2001 it takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three pairs are related mark austin a young man in his 20s gay and hiv positive is estranged from his conservative parents elizabeth and rev robert austin br br mark is now a drifter and arrives in beach north carolina a seaside town where he meets george sensitively played by michael kelly a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other meanwhile mark's birth mother grace played by bonnie hunt has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was 17 similarly mark's adoptive mother also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him despite the misgivings of her homophobic minister husband br br we're told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its achilles heel director writer tim tries too hard to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found take mark and both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about there's some slight tension when grace faces off against an adoption agency director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies that she of her when she became pregnant as a teenager no sparks fly either between elizabeth and robert since the good reverend has adamantly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son br br is similar to in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males for example the beach cop and the reverend are the baddies the biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction and hence no dramatic conflict between mark and either one of his mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him br br theme is both a plea for tolerance and an for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it's too late sentiments are for the most part well intentioned but they do not make for good drama loggerheads moves along at a snail's pace without providing any new revelations or suspense regarding such topics as aids adoption and homophobia ultimately fails due to a lack of originality
<START> i am a huge fan of the farcry game huge fan it still holds a place in my top 10 games list of all time the story line was new fresh a truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on or so i thought br br farcry the movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise see doom the movie and many more br br the video game begins as the player jack carver awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier jack then finds a communication device where harlan doyle guides him across islands jungles installations and volcanoes to find his lady friend valerie constantine all the wile battling mutated super soldiers and genetically enhanced animals br br the movie plays out very very differently 1 there's a needless 30 mins 1 3 of the movie of backstory before we even get to the blowing up' scene 2 jack then walks onto the beach kills some goons then drives off nothing like the game 3 there is no communicator with doyle on the other end 4 the soldiers' look like with on and there was no mutated 'monkey like' creatures jumping out of the bushes a part of the farcry game i enjoyed allot 5 there is no sun filled beach scenes no aircraft carrier no communications stations on huge cliffs little reference to any in game contents characters items vehicles in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all 6 the climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building 7 there's an ending scene where everyone except live happily ever after what the br br i recommend avoiding this movie at all costs if you are a gamer you will hate this movie will all your soul it is a movie clearly intended for males so girls stay away so if your a male 12 29 years of age have never played farcry and are not disgusted by directors attempts at books games to the cinema then this is for you
<START> 1999 adaptation of mansfield park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film the 1999 film is reviled by many austen purists but i admire the job did in making mansfield park her own it may not be strictly jane austen's mansfield park but at least it was well written beautifully shot and well acted by a superior cast i don't see how austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version from itv and rebroadcast on masterpiece theatre pbs the screenplay is shoddily pasted together and dumbed down to boot the production values are lackluster and the cast apart from redgrave and blake are largely guilty of bad acting i can't think of a worst miscast than billie piper as fanny price her look was all wrong bleached hair and dark brows and her talent simply wasn't suited to the material sir thomas looked constipated the whole time michelle ryan as mariah was on autopilot as were the actors who portrayed the crawfords when i think how superior alessandro nivola and embeth davidtz were in the '99 version i just kinda shake my head br br i haven't seen the 1983 version so i can't comment on it but i'd advise anyone who's curious to give the '99 version a chance read the novel before or after and make up your own mind
