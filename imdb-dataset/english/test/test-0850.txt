<START> the movie begins with much voice over a bad sign then it just slides downhill with silly and intelligence insulting scenes involving and indians but it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry mountain men square dance with each other in a high alpine meadow meanwhile the happy go lucky indians sit around watching them it's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in blazing saddles there is a minor flaw in this comparison across the wide missouri is not a comedy br br
<START> 'be with me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie just leave it running in the background chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point it'll end br br alas as i watched it alone and so i felt like i almost watched the world's worst longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time i just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled and i then managed just a a few more moments of to witness a 'thank you' to the movie's sponsors which included asia pacific aha how surprising is that given all the shots of tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie br br meanwhile dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movie's overall story is said or witnessed it's as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and you'd really have missed nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency or part of its plot as far as the movie's overall progression was concerned thus the ultimate wallpaper movie br br well i wonder what movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching i wonder and continue to wonder it certainly couldn't have been this arty to the point of artless singaporean excuse for a camera's rolling allegedly 'be with me' is supposed to be woven around the themes of love tragedy and redemption but all i witnessed was boredom a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended what a wistful waste of time it ended up being it was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for theresa chan who is a remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities well no disrespect to ms chan but given that she was such a marvellous amazing character why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling rather than tying in the fates of all characters i really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concerned br br i am generally an art house movie fan and don't usually object to slow pacing of which here there is no shortage believe you me i hate such movies as 300 transformers fight club but consider e g eric rohmer as a great film maker so i hope that puts my criticism into some perspective nonetheless there was no redeemable feature whatsoever in the entire movie's conception and delivery which could prevent one's eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of 'be with me' dripped by watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time otherwise your life would be none the richer for having missed it 3 10
<START> as a fan of dan aykroyd i watched this film when it was recently shown in the middle of night on tv i wasn't expecting much so it came as a big surprise that i loved it so much br br this is the type of film that dan aykroyd seems to love to make a chance for him to it up' and not take things too seriously if you loved him in the blues brothers or ghostbusters you'll know what i mean and you'd be wise to check out the couch trip br br avid fans of aykroyd will also have fun spotting all the tiny links to his other films in the script br br i can't describe this film without spoiling it for you so all i can do is tell you to check it out i can't praise this film highly enough and it must surely be time for a dvd release
<START> this episode of buffy was one of my personal favorites also number three of personal favorites as well the episode featured very little dialogue and despite that the good folks at the emmy's decided it merited a nomination unfortunately it didn't win when hush first premiered it received about 6 million viewers which was the highest rated episode of season four that should tell you something even though there was very little talking it managed to intrigue people enough to tune in those gentlemen characters who were played my mimes were some of the scariest creatures the show has produced or any network tv show i've seen nothing is creepier then a bunch of silver teethed men coming at you with a scalpel while smiling away i think that despite the lack of dialogue the actors did a fantastic job on the episode
<START> this almost perfect cinematic rendition of edith popular children's novel follows the lives of roberta bobbie phyllis and peter and their mother after their father is unfairly accused of treason and sent to prison they go to live in an almost house in the country which stands near a railway line Â mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and specifically waving to one particular train to their love to father' br br always an involving and clever novel the characters are here brought to life under the perceptive direction of lionel jeffries better known as a fine character actor jenny agutter plays bobbie while sally thomsett and gary warren are her sister and brother their mother is dinah sheridan while the other memorable characters are played by bernard cribbins perks the railway man and william mervyn the old gentleman on the train br br 'the railway children' is gentle entertainment from another age but does its job beautifully as we watch bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent parent jostling against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun we can only rejoice when events come together at the close of the picture throughout we have a sense of time and place Â be it from the steam trains the university paper chase or the red worn by the girls and used to avert disaster
<START> our family and the entire sold out sneak preview audience enjoyed the guardian kevin costner and ashton kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters ben and jake after seeing this movie you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues br br even though this is a fictional movie it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual u s coast guard br br the special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible you actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue br br i feel the movie could have been made without the hollywood bar scene when you see the movie you might agree since the real coast guard does not condone such behavior br br very entertaining very action packed definitely worth seeing thank you u s coast guard and the real helicopter rescue swimmers so others may live i'd highly recommend this movie to everyone
<START> when i first looked at the back of the cover of this film it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to 82 memorable minutes and it certainly was memorable was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible how it was possible that it was released on dvd at all out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that night we might just have picked the worst and yes they had tomb raider absolutely nothing in this movie amused me even slightly who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by suggestions from the main character out of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with this is now my favourite the character the village idiot played by nickolas grace is the most annoying character since they started making movies in color if there is one single movie that you definately not should see this year please let it be cause i don't think it can be any worse i still wonder if this just might have been the worst way i have spent my money and take my word for that i have made many lousy purchases over the years
<START> this movie was really bad first they didn't even follow the facts for it half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of ed victims the acting was horrible except for the guy playing ed gein but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos that was the best part of the movie as soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill the writer of this movie tried to spice it up but it didn't need to be the story of ed gein is interesting enough without falsifying information
<START> the video case for this film reads a story of beauty passion and forbidden fruit are they talking about the same movie i just saw they can't be as the film i just saw was beautiful but there was no passion and as for the fruit this is all hogwash meant to entice the potential viewer to see this movie if only it did have some passion or some life to it i would have greatly enjoyed this film instead it was an agonizingly slow paced and not particularly interesting film that i would definitely not want to see again it isn't that it's a bad film after all it is very beautifully filmed but it is dull beyond belief i kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen but then the movie just ended there was no great sense of excitement mystery or anything just a rather unexciting story about a young girl who becomes a servant and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a maid
<START> the characters was as unoriginal it hurts the little skinny dorky computer geek the funny african american with stupid punchlines cool white guy with a compassion for cars and the handsome leader who ends up with the pretty girl the actors is at best mediocre from norton who does a pretty good job as the bad guy br br the rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time its all in all about a group of spoiled boys using the world as their playground where every safe in a big house is what keeps them with food on the table i mean why work for a living when you can rob people br br and who the f messes with the traffic lights in a major european city and in the middle of the friggin day think of all the damages and not to say deaths among innocent civilians what about all the ambulances and br br i created no compassion for the main characters and weather mr wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not i could not give less of a fart
<START> robert florey and james wong howe gave this a frightening expressionistic look scenes are shot at weird angles especially scenes involving figurative and literal lady killer zachary scott his sociopathic behavior presages another superb medium budget movie the stepfather by more than two decades br br the entire cast is excellent though though no fault of her own it's hard to think of joyce compton as anyone but the singer in the awful truth scott bennett emerson decamp especially and though playing an older woman looking gorgeous they couldn't have been topped br br setting a creepy lodger in the house of women story against a background of psychiatrists is a risky trick that pays off beautifully nothing corny at all beautifully nothing corny at all br br the resolution is a little pat unfortunately not getting together with bennett that makes sense but scott is dispatched too quickly i seem him more as a mr ripley character who could have escaped everything the the murder rap the jealous sisters and disappeared into the great world beyond this story that would not have impeded the essentially happy ending of the secretary and her boss finally getting together
<START> in this tense and character driven romantic tragi comedy we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething parisians at the centre is portrayal of max a starry eyed romeo he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger lisa bellucci encouraged by his put upon best friend lucien in an understated but effective performance he wins her heart and they live happily ever after that is until the scheming neurotic and obsessive alice the versatile becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three br br the rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw the eye candy of picture postcard paris at the heart of it all the use of colour does not go unnoticed particularly in lisa's spectacular apartment presumably accounting for the film's title where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust br br the audience can relate to max he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it in one memorable scene our fated lovers agonisingly separated by a misunderstanding narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them independent of one another they travel to the same destination her on the metro him in a taxi practically Ã  yet fate seems to have it in for them and the audience is captivatingly teased br br the performances in this film are really what make l'appartement stand out i still cannot understand why vincent cassell is not a big star outside france he has presence and diversity in abundance monica bellucci real life spouse at the time of writing has recently found fame in the film industry but perhaps for the wrong reasons true she is divinely beautiful but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic lady' style which many british and american actresses dismiss in favour of the all too easy 'subtle' approach br br all in all watch this film i doubt you'll be disappointed it is gripping satisfying amusing sad lavish and a lesson in artistic film making
<START> this movie is total dreck i love val kilmer and was very surprised earlier this year by felon a good movie the entire dvd box is misleading val kilmer while being billed as one of the main people in this film is in the movie for about 2 minutes even the summary on the back of the dvd is not entirely true this could have been a good movie but the direction was horrible and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper usually when a movie is this horrendous you can sit back and laugh at it this film though is so bad and boring i actually fell asleep to it which i never do during a movie avoid at all costs
<START> in fassbinder's earlier films his ideas sometimes his ability to execute them he was always a great writer but it took him some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat br br the merchant of four seasons is one of fassbinder's first movie to make great use of color from the bright green pears in the cart to the bright red roses at the funeral a funeral in a fassbinder movie who'd have thought br br his camera work was getting there too but it was still fairly minimalist the occasional zooms seem a bit uncomfortable at times and unnatural but then again fassbinder was still coming out of his purely avant garde phase this might be because michael isn't behind the camera but instead the slightly inferior dietrich br br still this is fassbinder and you get your fix here broken dreams shown so vividly and unflinchingly as to alienate audience and drive them into a depressed stupor just what the doctor ordered an early classic that shows remarkable progression when compared to his first films released only 2 years prior
<START> so glad i have hbo right now i didn't plan on watching a movie today but when i got home and saw that the next movie on hbo was this one i decided based on the description to at least give it a shot i'm so glad i decided to watch this movie maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment i'm a little stressed out got a huge test to be studying for but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy i'm currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me br br anyhow i just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed there is definitely something for everyone in this movie
