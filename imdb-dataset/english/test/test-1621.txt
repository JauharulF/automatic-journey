<START> oh my god this is so idiotic completely pointless offensive and repulsive why do the writers have such a problem with actually getting zoey and chase together we all want them too in normal shows there's actually more than one plot conflict in the show wow what a concept also you cant even tell the zoey 101 episodes apart from each other because the same thing happens every time quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing nicole is giggly and stupid zoey is just kinda there chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice and logan is a jerk repeat quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing nicole is giggly and stupid zoey is just kinda there chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice and logan is a jerk repeat it's like a shampoo bottle and the end of the movie omg again so pointless nothing happens it's like they specifically designed it so that the movie could fit between any two episodes of the show and the show would go completely unchanged after the movie plot
<START> retro puppet master starts in during 1944 where puppet master andre toulon guy rolfe his living puppets plan to escape germany hold up in an inn puppet master toulon reminisces about his early life the point at which he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects way back in 1902 in paris when his younger self greg ran the he describes the fateful night when he met a 3000 year old egyptian sorcerer named jack donner the eventual love of hi life the young beautiful ilsa brigitta dau he tells the story of how passed the gift of life to himself gave life to his own wooden puppets that were part of the theatre show however the gift of life was also a curse as the ancient god whom the secret was stolen from in the first place by wants it back everyone who has learnt it dead br br as of late i have been on a bit of a puppet master bender as being a big fan of the first three i decided to watch the rest of the franchise as such i have seen puppet master 4 1993 puppet master 5 the final chapter 1994 curse of the puppet master 1998 now retro puppet master in the space of a couple of weeks boy was it tough to get through them all especially this one as it's the worse of the series so far retro puppet master feels like a cross between puppet master iii toulon's revenge 1991 with it's period setting puppet master 4 puppet master 5 the final chapter with trying to kill everyone associated with his stolen life giving secret there's not much continuity here either again there's none of the green serum featured in the earlier films despite andre toulon committing suicide in 1939 at the start of the original puppetmaster 1989 he is seen alive well during 1944 in this the majority of the story is told as a flashback concentrates on andre toulon himself rather than the puppets the film focuses on his relationship with ilsa him learning the secret of life it's all rather dull tedious stuff to be honest even at only 80 odd minutes retro puppet master feels long padded with no real pace the no central concept as the plot never really settles down generally hops around a lot then of course there's the baffling decision to totally redesign the puppets which i found incredible i mean why would the makers take the one basic thing that made the puppet master films so memorable completely do away with it the puppets are seen briefly at the start the end but otherwise we get these rubbishy looking wooden caricatures that are nowhere near as cool as their modern re workings it's never even explained why these puppets were used rather than the ones all puppet master fans have come to love although one suspects that full moon was hoping to make yet another sequel which dealt with that very question br br if a poor story a complete lack of our favourite puppets wasn't bad enough full moon decided to go with a pg 13 rating for this making retro puppet master the only puppet master film not rated 'r' in the us obviously other countries have their own film ratings systems therefore there's not a single drop of blood in the entire film the puppets don't kill anyone there's no swearing no nudity either this is tamer than tame kids stuff all the way besides the puppets themselves being rubbish the special effect are the of the series too there's no stop motion animation at all in this one no cgi computer effects surely in 1999 cgi was cheap enough all the effects are of the stiff rod puppet type effects i mean whenever you see a puppet the camera is always positioned above it's wait so it's legs don't have to be shown there's obviously some production assistant just pushing the thing along that's as complex state of the art as the special effects get br br the one positive thing that retro puppet master does have going for it is that it looks rather nice the period production design costumes props are actually quite impressive it's a fairly handsome film to watch at times apparently filmed in bucharest in romania which doubles up quite nicely for turn of the last century paris the acting here is awful maybe the worst of the series br br retro puppet master is more or less the final puppet master film as the next one puppet master the legacy 2004 basically edits together footage from the previous seven films it's a pretty crappy way to round the series off which started so well with three excellent distinctive little killer puppet flicks don't bother with this just watch one of the first three again just remember the good times the killer puppets would return in the terrible spin off flick puppet master vs demonic toys 2004
<START> some people say the pace of this film is a little slow but how is this different from any other hitchcock movie they all move very deliberately and as a point have spurts of suspense and brilliant montages injected through it this movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief which make the suspense scenes seem all the more suspenseful the albert hall scene is one of the best examples of pure cinema that exists in hitchcock's collection the best probably being almost all of rear window pure cinema for hitchcock meant a series of usually small pieces of film fit together without dialogue in order to tell the story visually this is of course the basic definition of the albert hall sequence as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the picture br br not many slip ups by hitchcock here and the acting is superb especially by doris day in a rather surprising serious role
<START> you know this movie reminded me so much of so many people i know i think that's the reason why i loved this movie so much i was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it but the dialog is so hilarious that you can't help but have a good time basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously it turns out the owners are just as insane megan one of the dog owners goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog br br there is another couple that is just great gerry and cookie this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable in the beginning of the movie gerry describes how many boyfriends cookie had throughout the movie her lovers see her and hit on her even in front of gerry it was just great and fun to watch gerry's looks this whole movie is just a hoot and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up it's a great movie is just fun to watch i'd highly recommend it now i have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves d br br 8 10
<START> this film is superb it has the same low budget first film feel of 'pi' and 'clerks' but has the style of also by writer director christopher nolan the score sound effects photography and editing are almost prototypes and the story shows that christopher nolan is best when writing and directing don't be put off by the low budget look and acting or even the short length of the film and just watch it
<START> the love letter 1999 starring kate capshaw tom everett scott tom selleck ellen de gloria stuart blythe danner jessica capshaw alice drummond bill erik jensen margaret ann brady walter covell patrick donnelly lucas hall christian harmony christopher nee smith marilyn sasha spielberg jack black director peter chan screenplay maria br br based on the novel the love letter by schine director peter chan's film version released in 1999 was not a big box office draw not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements while it was not as popular in theaters it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on vhs dvd set in a town in the good old usa i forget the exact location this is the story of a mysterious passionately written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters each who think the letter is personally addressed to them by the end of the film we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town the cast is made up of wonderful actors who have fared well on tv and film among them kate capshaw in the lead role of middle aged beauty helen a bookstore owner comedienne ellen degeneres as her friend employee janet hall young hottie tom everett scott as johnny the young 20 something guy who falls for the older and an older tom selleck as the firefighter george matthias who must compete with johnny for helen's affections there are cameo roles by veteran old hollywood actress gloria stuart who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly rose in titanic 1997 and a cameo by kate capshaw's own daughter with husband steven spielberg jessica capshaw the love triangle is between a middle aged woman an older man and a young man each of whom feel as passionately for helen as the writer of the mysterious letter the conflict lies in helen's indecision will she choose the right person which man has the most to offer her johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own and is in fact a kind of reminder of what helen was like at her age george is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life a cultured intellectual he takes helen on an opera date where the tragic death of puccini's ultra italian heroine tosca moves helen to explosive tears there are lots of beautiful vistas of the charming coastal town rendered beautifully by cinematographer tami the score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs i've never been in love before i'm in the mood for love and only the lonely ellen degeneres as janet hall who is consistently late to her job at helen's bookshop who endlessly dates men without being able to find the right guy is simply wonderful she has not lost her comedic flair even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on tv or film because only about two years before her hit mid 90's tv show ellen was cancelled because of her coming out as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject matter of the show here you even find comedian jack black long before he made it big in the bit part of a fisherman this is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant about the human need for a passionate consuming love and the general love of escapism brought not only through books letters and music but through a genuinely loving and secure relationship this is a great film with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit
<START> it's funny one day before i have seen this movie i had been watching a documentary about leni riefenstahl so comparison kind of came automatically of course there isn't any br br this movie is weak in every aspect acting is not convincing especially the one who plays and unnatural editing in confused and always leaves a taste of unfinished shot music doesn't fit the story doesn't flow it gets boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is oh and the characters aren't very well shown you actually can't tell much about the girls except what you see the movie also tries to shock with explicit cursing which is very laughable br br so 2 10
<START> after reading the terrible reviews of this movie including comments said to be quoted from colin i almost didn't bother to add this film to my firth film collection however being the firth fan which i am intrigue got the better of me br br to my surprise i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it had suspense drama and intrigue and v sexy colin scene's the plot kept me guessing right until the end credits and i felt that once one got past jennifer rubens opening scene's that the actress played her role convincingly colin was as brilliant as ever and its great to see him play a character from the 'dark side' a 'chill went down my and after watching this i can't wait to see recent film to be out on dvd br br ok perhaps it a film that was 'in your face' so to speak and one couldn't 'go to sleep on the plot' especially towards the end as there was a lot going on but that was what i liked about it the acting was subtle thankfully not overdone like many suspense thrillers this made the film all the more chilling to watch one just couldn't second guess what character ross talbert or for that matter jennifer rubens character jamie harris was going to do next and there were quite a few surprises in store i sat on the edge of my seat throughout with a cushion handy br br personally i am very glad that i watched and i shall certainly rewind and view again i think that any firth fan would benefit from watching this film if they didn't like the plot then just watch colin
<START> i love umberto lenzi's cop movies rome armed to the teeth is my favorite and his desert commandos pretty much the italian euro war phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie give him guns machines some guys to run around talking tough and it's hard for him to miss br br what a shame it is then to encounter his eaten alive and cannibal ferox they could have been by anybody really and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract was told what kind of films to make was assigned a cast crew and given a budget deadline and script then went out and executed his films the same way that a guy at mcdonald's fixes a batch of french fries of the two eaten alive is the more original which is kind of amazing considering that it features extensive footage copped from three other cannibal movies and easier to enjoy than cannibal ferox though not much br br i will let others outline the plot what fascinated me about the film is how staged it all looks and yet what a somewhat infamous reputation this film has as some sort of all out assault on good taste it isn't though the film is an exercise in bad taste complete with a title earning scene where two of the pretty supporting ladies are quite literally sliced up and eaten alive by cannibals which is the film's high point the problem is that lets us get a good long look at the cannibal feast scene and it has the convincing ring of a 3rd season star trek episode complete with a fake jungle set for the really gory close up shots and i don't know about anyone else but if someone was slicing off pieces of my person and eating them i wouldn't just lie there and look distressed br br my problem with the film might be that i have a lot of respect for as a filmmaker and again this could have been directed by anybody all of your cannibal movie conventions are touched on but it never feels like they are filmed with any real conviction other than to try and bully ruggero deodato out of the sandbox the two directors certainly must have known each other and either had a sort of juvenile rivalry or an actual dislike for each other's work and a conscious need to upstage them invented the cannibal genre with man from deep river deodato blew it away with jungle holocaust fired back with eaten alive deodato blew him and everyone else away with the superior cannibal holocaust and fired a last parting salvo with cannibal ferox which is about as realistic as that krazy commercial where the guy his hardhat to a and hangs in midair br br this film is less desperate and a bit more hesitant to push viewers into the abyss with everything holy than ferox which remains as a sort of misguided attempt to upstage cannibal holocaust this one is more of a mish mash with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a jim jones like suicide cult the cannibals seem like they were added as an afterthought rather than the reason for making the film i think that fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of lenzi's films looking for something new by the formidable director it isn't as entertaining as slave of the cannibal god adventurous as his own man from deep river and certainly lacks the wallop of cannibal holocaust combine those considerations with the recycled footage stomach churning scenes of animal violence misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and stagy wooden methodology of film making and what you get ends up being an ok jungle thriller with two or three standout scenes and umberto was capable of so much more br br 4 10 gore freaks will go nuts however
<START> i was wrapped to see many other people also enjoyed this film first watched it when i was in my early teens and then again several times late at night a few times after then sadly no more i'm now nearly 49 and so wish it could be made available on dvd why not the best anthony quinn role no one could have been more suited for the part or parts he plays i've mentioned it to other film buffs of similar age and alas no one i know recalls it as the daughter of a generation that went through wwii and its aftermath and myself deeply fascinated by what that generation endured i guess this film at the time gave me a wonderful cinematic insight into some of the heartbreaking issues of the day for classic final scenes this movie is a stand out
<START> at least the jingle by tim finn was melodic roberts is the his usual inept self characters are inconsistent dull purposeless roberts changes his accent even within one line
<START> ah another movie with motorcycles hell's angels posse and steve a lame o as the not so cool car driver this movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking pot smoking and lots of moronic acts steve's rendition of a dying cat during his i love what i know serenade had me vomiting for hours bike chick linda makes out with everyone fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds i also dare you to try to make out what banjo is saying you wit private stock this is scriptwriting folks br br i liked the ending what better place to have the climax than a lighthouse you have to see this to detest it br br die jeter die
<START> has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating tv networks made it possible for people to produce direct finance and or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to is that a good thing br br this film does not answer the latter question either way but it does appear that without curb jeff would not have been able to make i want someone to eat cheese with br br like most new producers directors jeff independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for curb and yet is it a sensitive guy film he isn't really a sensitive guy likable sure relatable indeed br br what this film really is about is a bit hard to say i can only relate what i took away from it br br i rented the film because of the trailers particularly the scene of a counselor portrayed by amy sedaris informing james aaron that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she is a chubby chaser i just about fell out of my seat based on that scene alone i ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie the reason i thought the school counselor sedaris was talking about beth portrayed by sarah silverman i imagined a romantic comedy between the foxy silverman and the fat i didn't think the story would be anything original but that the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move along at a satisfying pace in short i thought it would be a comedy br br it was intriguing that the film started out that way but then took a much much more realistic turn when beth gives james the heave ho because i've never really been with a fat guy before that is how brutally we live life and it was completely realistic i applaud the decision it just meant that beth has now left the building and with her the one snappy person in the film br br james's relationship with his mother was also interesting that part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out as a play it had that intricate feel to it the whole marty movie within a movie thing was utterly lost on me as i have never seen that film br br there were serious doubts i had about the character of james aaron though is it really possible that at 39 he had not had a serious relationship and he is an actor that did not really square with me to me his persona was less actor y and more corporate i could not really buy his ordinariness either no doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with beth did not work out we felt that but then did he really care br br another thing how in the world can both he and his mother afford to move out at the same time hasn't he just lost his job the last one he had that was one reason he did not seem ordinary to me where's the funding for his life coming from br br and yet i have read reviews that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness so there is that yes it is very realistic the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it is all that we have the way we sort of disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions james and stella some kind of self that takes place just to move on to the next moment that contrasted with the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments our thoughts the way james had with beth it's really crushing br br very well done
<START> i caught this movie a few years ago one night and it was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen however since it is supposed to be an action movie i cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentional br br chuck norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film good thing too the sub par acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast actually the judge was pretty good but i can't really describe what makes him work you'll have to check it out for yourself br br and the custom van chuck norris drives is hideously classic
