<START> i'm impressed that the woman' was made at all released just one year after american women got the vote this turgid drama makes an earnest plea against the sexual double standard which judges women's sexual behaviour more harshly than men's br br slight spoilers ahead a prologue set in the plymouth colony in shows a pilgrim girl sentenced to the ducking stool for flirting with a boy the boy is not now we come to flint hill new hampshire in the present 1921 oliver beresford theodore roberts is a bombastic bible thumper what we call in britain and australia 'a god beresford is determined that his son david lloyd hughes become a preacher regardless of how david feels about it as for beresford's daughter judith well beresford is confident that women aren't important enough to be anything more than wives and mothers apparently god told him this personally br br david's evangelical career is compromised when he impregnates nan higgins the stepdaughter of the local odd jobs man tully marshall's character is identified in the credits solely as the jobs man' but a close up of a cheque reveals his name to be jake higgins the prejudices of 1921 require that he be merely stepfather not her biological parent to save his son from scandal beresford buys off stepfather with a cheque nan goes off to the big city to melt into oblivion as one more unwed mother br br judith is naturally dismayed by the limitations imposed upon her by her gender or rather by other people's perceptions of it she meets gray excellent performance by edward an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes but judith is informally engaged to local lout joe hurd who won't put up with such nonsense hurd is played by vernon dent a burly performer now remembered solely for comedy roles as a second banana to harry langdon and as a villain in three stooges movies he gives an excellent performance here in a role outside his usual range sadly in real life dent spent his final years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic br br eventually judith ends up working at an orphanage this being 1921 i expected the orphanage to be whites only so i was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to include one chinese boy and unpleasantly surprised when he's used as the butt for a racial joke the movie makes one odd error here in a christmas sequence we see the orphanage mistress reciting 'a visit from saint but in a dialogue title she credits santa claus with six reindeer rather than eight this is followed by a brief animation sequence showing santa with six reindeer hitched to his sleigh i assume that the animators either by accident or to save money left out two reindeer and the title card revised the poem to match the error br br lloyd hughes was generally a bland and unimpressive actor his most famous performance is his role in 'the lost world' where he's easily upstaged by a rampaging brontosaurus for his climactic scene in the woman' hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father's tyranny in his performance as the gospel shouting father theodore roberts has been accused of overacting to the point of making his role a caricature i disagree sadly decades after this film was made i continue to encounter fools exactly like this man willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them and firmly convinced they have god's authority to do so br br in the central role of judith beresford florence vidor gives a sensitive realistic and intelligent performance i normally dislike vidor who tended to be cast in glamour roles but wasn't pretty enough to justify them here her character's physical appearance is less relevant than usual br br this entire film is impressively directed by john griffith wray a director who deserves to be much better known sadly wray died at the onset of the talkies era in his mid thirties had he lived another ten years he would surely have helmed several early sound classics in the woman' there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions i was especially impressed by a scene in the new england forest when vidor and dent have a quarrel in front of an enormous uprooted tree i wonder where this was actually filmed the woman' deals with unpleasant subject matter but it deserves to be much better known and i'll rate this ambitious drama 9 out of 10
<START> firstly this is not an adaptation of a stephen king book short story novella or anything else from web site and their review on the show when it first aired he never writes down to his audience and he never betrays contempt for his subjects his first original work for television stephen king's cbs july 16 9 11 p m is no exception br br the series was apparently going to be as others have mentioned an ongoing series which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on but this was never quite made clear to the viewers who were left wondering how it all ends br br when the series came out on videotape it touted itself as having the never before seen ending it should have said the should never be seen ending br br spoiler br br the very ending was the only significant part changed for the video though parts of the whole were left out and that changed ending was what destroyed the story for example rather than our two intrepid fbi agents realizing that they were now labeled as bad guys and on the run from the evil jude anderson of the shop as originally broadcast jude simply walks up to them and they shoot him bang dead and no real emotion to speak of in the scene ditto on the bit with harlan and his wife going poof whereas the original ending left us with a spectacular cliff hanger on the video they simply get out of the cock a car br br end spoiler br br it was a sad ending to a rather well made mini series and makes the video completely not worth buying or even renting sincerely save your money and your time
<START> i first saw this movie on ifc which is a great network by the way to see underground films i watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn't hold water but it really was a worth while watch the main character is in such rough shape and you hate to see him deny help but no matter what you just can't hate him his devotion to the beatles and john lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels br br the atmosphere of the film is also great at times you feel like you can see what he sees feel what he feels in some situations this movie does not leave you wanting to know more or disliking a loophole in the plot there are no loopholes in my opinion i have always been a fan of foreign films especially now with movies being made so poorly in america i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand a different culture this movie did all those things to me and more please watch this movie and if you're new to foreign films this is a great start
<START> bad bad movie so bad it is worth watching as long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie it's worth it the special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny if your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her if she did get eaten wouldn't you fall on your knees crying your heart out this guy just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair how anti climatic is that maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something he does join his sister in the belly oh didn't mean to spoil it for you
<START> this has some of the stupidest fight scenes of all time if i was a veteran of any war i would cry when i see this movie not because i would remember being in vietnam but because it is a poor representation of any veteran of that war even though the troops are carrying that movie resembles nothing like vietnam the viet cong even uniforms look like old leftover japanese uniforms from a wwii movie the setting is obviously some crappy hollywood back lot the worst scene contains a us soldier fighting hand to hand like in a bad martial arts movie after he dispatches several enemy troops he says hey come down here and lets kick some butt to a helicopter in the air he then is shot this movie is trash
<START> a well written screenplay a moving story showing the middle class english at it's best some great acting by tom wilkinson and emily watson tom wilkinson is one of britain's best actors he knows how to be subtle and honest emily watson is an actress i was not familiar with but to her credit she does a great job of playing the wife the director julian fellowes did not succumb to the typical hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline it has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the english middle class the films pace does not falter although it is not a faced paced film a good twist in the plot that is not predictable a lovely english country village setting i enjoyed this film very much the locations were also very well selected if you enjoy films about relationships this is one to watch better to have some tissues ready
<START> not just because of that theme in the movie which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot no br br i watched this knowing i would not like it i hate numerology whenever someone starts going off about patterns with numbers i feel the urge to slap them my own brain starts hurting out of empathy and fully aware this is a movie just about that topic i couldn't resist the urge to watch it and maybe get a good laugh but it wasn't funny just exactly the dumb sort of isn't this totally scary and yet amazingly cool i can turn any crap into 23 dialog i was afraid of as soon as the son started to chime in i knew this movie is a turd no matter what happens but i hardly ever stop watching a movie i started i sat through it i enjoy the pain br br the movie pretends to mock numerology under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly but it rides that wave as much as it's supposed to crush it i don't see that message i only see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify br br top that off with the usual surprises trying to put another twist to throw you off that makes no sense and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narration up to there and you get one hollow piece of movie making that just happens to be centered around the topic i despise if only it did not try to be serious and rather had been some hilarious movie with actors i don't give a damn about but i was starting to like carrey while it's not his fault he is trying it's not even good for watching with a bunch of friends and mst3k the hell out of it br br my expectations were low enough for someone to trip on them but this movie managed to live up to be one of the worst i've ever seen
<START> i hope this isn't a portent of things to come high definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time although i wouldn't swear that's what was used here so it's open season for all the wannabe and br br there is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker and calling it a 'film' would be doing the industry a big disservice the photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo i could build me a new house with all the wooden acting what's remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst they are all equally terrible like a whole bunch of ben or steven seagals br br what hooked me was the title i'm a sucker for this sort of thing like frankenhooker or frankenhooker was pretty bad too but at least i got some laughs out of it and the acting was merely bad not awful i can't comment on as i've yet to get hold of a copy of it br br anyway i hope the people who made this didn't make any money from it else they might be encouraged to try it on again please guys pawn the camcorder and go back to your regular job
<START> a group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies and the only form of help is affable local mr chuck connors as night falls the kids get picked off in record time br br an odd freaky b movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of all too lifelike mannequins making this a good update of the bodies in the wax museum genre this is an intense shock fest along the lines of the texas chain saw massacre it should then come as no surprise that art director robert a burns repeats that duty here and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy pino score is downright chilling accompanied by the murky photography of nicholas von sternberg it the film in oppressive atmosphere br br plot twists vary in level of success there was one that i saw coming a mile away and one that actually took me by surprise and i was all the more happier for it one of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition the capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the end br br star connors offers an engaging performance as our down home good ol' boy antagonist while the younger co stars predictably can't perform at the same level although jocelyn jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damsel in distress co star tanya roberts a brunette in this film is okay in support if i had one problem with this film it's just that the victims are a little too stupid then again that doesn't make this much different from many horror films of the 80's future notable names among the credits are future directors ted who was the editor here ron underwood who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with tremors as the assistant director and veteran makeup artist ve neill who's done many films and won three oscars since br br although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director david schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto recommended br br 8 10
<START> the costumes are outrageous and the australian outback scenery is fun to view but there is an edge to this story a mean edge about drag queens i particularly noticed that in terrence stamp's character ralph bernadette bassenger perhaps that was appropriate since there is nothing good guy like about ralph bernadette and his group of queens br br once again we get the strong liberal slant which says anything goes and if you're not with it or in this case pro homosexual then you are a gasp br br what's really disturbing is the ending when a young boy goes off with his alternative lifestyle father and embraces his gay lifestyle not because it fit the story but because it fit the agenda of the people who wrote the script pitiful
<START> this is one of l h's shorts most frequently cited as the first real l h teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features j ollie is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew philip whom he's never seen at first ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting he has been told that philip is a good boy but he has one weakness women and philip set off to go home but their journey there is continually interrupted by philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman then chasing after the woman huge crowds gather each time this happens not so much because he's chasing skirts but because philip himself is also wearing a skirt a kilt finally manages to drag philip into a shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants but philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts there are lots of laughs all around it's also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren't exactly the characters we know and love ollie is pretty much his usual character but it's such a joy to see stan acting so differently from his usual man child character it shows he wasn't a one trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance with a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches
<START> this version of alice in wonderland is truly original equal parts porn fairy tale and musical comedy this film is definitely a strange bit of adult film history br br alice is a sexually naive librarian who ends up following the rabbit into wonderland where she meets all kinds of experienced weirdos like the mad hatter who likes to pull his dong out whenever possible humpty dumpty who broke his along with his shell and a brother sisters sex crazed duo and the bi sexual queen among others br br this version of alice in wonderland is actually quite tame by the standards of the time a time when a lot of porn was mean spirited and nasty as noted by the roughie sub genre this one is actually quite funny and strangely endearing it's the kind of thing you'd show your kids if it weren't for the graphic sex a little slow getting to the good stuff but genuinely entertaining oh and some of the musical numbers are downright hilarious if you're a drinker have a few if you're a smoker roll a couple and give this one a shot 8 10
<START> ok first said i just wanted to check whether this movie has an average rating below or exactly 1 but 5 9 this is sicker than any of the killers' proceedings that made me curious what people wrote here which in the end made me set up an account to give my of truth into this well of delusion i find here br br how dare you guys even mention this movie in the same sentences as e g seven the only thing they got in common is that they show various crime scenes that is it and best thriller of 1999 have you even watched another movie form that year or any other movie in your life at all 1999 is not a year which people are reminded of by resurrection what's with actual movies like 8mm eyes wide shut arlington road double jeopardy actually more a thriller than this one could ever be resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to a second of 1999 br br really you guys can't be serious i watched that movie yesterday with my girlfriend highly recommended by a friend of her a great film with christopher lambert which i had not yet seen hmm br br well first look on the covers ok nothing special at second glimpse you don't need to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply mirrored lambert's head clipped his nose 'n this that then made a fancy negative pattern on top of it to get the killers image on the cover you could even think they had some apprentice eat a gallon of marshmallows just to caption that creepy mouth whatever turned it around and the plot starts with it's raining in chicago blabber blabber come on a six year old could have made that snippet sound more exciting now with this enormous excitement coming from the movies terrific presentation you absolutely wanna start watching it because it can't be that bad it still is christopher lambert that assumption of mine was proved wrong with proven wrong i mean it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting ever known to mankind every actor but the tops are the i can do 1 liners police chief wife actually a better detective than prudhomme when she several incidents to a yet absolutely unknown hint in the case and yes prudhomme himself featuring a squadron of inhuman fake feelings logic errors in a 1 minute cycle light years far fetched conclusions which in my point of view represent an insult to any thinking human being and last but not least a camera man who obviously was a hyperventilating kangaroo oh well and if you do not completely shut down your brains these aren't premises to watch it then you should know who is who and what is what after max simply because you know any scene after the first that is thrilling thrilling because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future br br the bottom line this is by far the worst movie i can remember trust me i've seen many horrible movies which in some way were at least only bad attempts or bad copies of another movie resurrection however is the best example on how to fail in every aspect possible it was so bad that after being shocked by its unimaginably low quality in e v e r y t h i n g i laughed more often than in any recent comedy simply because i was fascinated by the crew's to publish such an extraordinary film strip good thing for lambert he was in highlander endgame a year later thus he can be pardoned o br br anyhow i do recommend watching this movie to everyone in the end we had great fun watching it d i guarantee you after you completely watched resurrection be brave you can do it you will worship the level of acting in any given daily soap br br or just go 'n watch highlander one more time that's what i'm gonna do
<START> so much great chemistry between kristen scott thomas and harrison ford but every time the story about their relationship began to gather momentum the script cut away and dealt with some irrelevant sub plot that did nothing to advance the story indeed the subplots had nothing to do with the story at all they were like commercial breaks in which you watched a trailer for another movie br br the writers or someone who controlled the writers obviously didn't trust themselves to write compellingly about relationships and the interior lives of their characters they seemed to be uncomfortable unless they threw in some gun battles and bar fights or perhaps they didn't trust the audience to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship under difficult circumstances after all we all know how boring casablanca was br br perhaps if the relationship between kay and dutch had been developed more and had been allowed to play out the writers would have know how to end the story this film is a disappointment for not doing more with its wonderful actors who gave good performances but could have done more with a better script
<START> when people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said little these children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter in a film lets start with the blonde debbie she's a slut of a girl i mean come on she wears mini skirts she has stupid frizzy blonde hair and a red bunny like face she acts so innocent next we have the second child the geek who thinks he's so cool with his long range shooting and his use of a silencer a coat over the gun and most of all his evil bratty smile the next kid is the quiet one you don't care about so thats all on him this film angered me at the children's intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept bitching about them
