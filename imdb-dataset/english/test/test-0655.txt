<START> i found this movie to be a big disappointment especially considering the cast the characters are not believable as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves the only part of the film i enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed the special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies a typical unimaginative slasher flick br br it's hard to believe make that impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that sneaks up on goats in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of clumsy noisy idiots equally impossible to believe is how they knew exactly were to find it in spite of the fact the creature has capture or even photographing br br the man that pulls off the impossible in capturing the alive is our one dimensional dr pena giancarlo esposito the only thing dr pena is more obsessed with than the creature is his dart gun a dart gun that works were mere bullets fail br br the captain of the ship john rhys davies is introduced as a 'war he employs his military prowess by having his men shoot at the creature regardless of were on the ship they happen to be the navy seals that show up from nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything br br dylan neal plays an insurance investigator brought on board the cruise ship to catch a thief he spends most of the movie tagging along with whomever is trying to kill the creature at the moment br br the creature doesn't even closely resemble a it doesn't behave like one either instead of a small shy secretive animal that hunts by stealth at night we get a bulletproof freddy kruger killing everything in sight a simple search on google would have been very helpful to the writers and the special effects crew
<START> james aaron a chubby actor living in chicago is a man that loves to eat things that are no good for him that is made clear early on as dick a friendly store clerk advises him to stay away from junk food aaron an actor working at chicago's second city is a loving man with not much luck in the love department he still lives with his mother a spunky lady who encourages him to go out and enjoy himself james has another job in a sort of gross candid camera where people are set up for unusual situations such as surprising a mechanic and telling him he is the father of a daughter he never knew about br br on the day he meets his friend larry he gets to know about the casting call for the remake of marty his favorite film being a large man he clearly identifies with the character in the movie in many ways james' own life parallels that of the paddy creation in the picture he wants to try for the part because he knows he can do justice to the role br br one day he meets beth at a soda fountain james takes a liking to the woman who one day invites him to go shopping with her for intimate apparel he ends up having sex with her thinking they have a nice thing going but beth has a another surprise coming when she tells him the reason they went to bed was because she had never done it with a fat man after being disappointed james stumbles into an attractive elementary school teacher who seems to share his love for jazz at the end we watch james fulfilling his long dream of starring in a theatrical production of marty in a nursing home br br jeff who is an affable character man shows a talent for the type of comedy associated with his friend larry david although both men differ in acting styles his take on james aaron is right on the money as a director he has done it before although this is an original concept that he should pursue br br one of the assets of the film are the people involved in the project sarah silverman makes an impression for her take of beth bonnie hunt underplays her role of the school teacher to good results mina kolb is seen as his mother a role she has played in curb your enthusiasm with excellent results director paul mazursky is at hand also in a minor role joey slotnick tim richard kind david larry neumann jr gina gershon and the rest of the cast make valuable contributions br br jeff is a talented man whose next effort will be welcomed by his fans
<START> the book is great it's one of my favorite books ever the film on the other hand is amazingly insipid and bad when i heard damon would play ripley i knew this production was doomed but i didn't expect it to be this bad the actors go around and act very showy except for law and even he is guilty of some showy acting all the actors here are near amateurish speaking italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting damon is miscast he's way too stiff for a character that's supposed to be a chameleon paltrow is forgettable and hoffman plays yet another effeminate slimy character talk about typecasting br br what's really unforgivable about the script written by the overrated director is that it completely forgoes every subtle details from the book and comes up with many of its own and none of them work the addition of the jazz music stuff is totally wrong i guess idea of italy in the late 50s early 60s is clouded with images of chet baker roaming the italian countryside and spreading amore yep is a true visionary the film is so bleeding obvious that silly scene when ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors very laughable yes we get the point every point or detail comes across a mile away so much so that the film might give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers we know for example that the blanchett character introduced at the beginning of the movie will return later on only complicate things and the soundtrack at times is totally inappropriate whimsical when it shouldn't be the film goes on for too long and in all sorts of pointless directions there are too many boring characters the landscape many that weren't in the book this film is bad really bad br br apparently son told his father that the ripley novel was his favorite mr then proceeded to direct it as a favor of sorts to his son well the director did achieve what he set out to do talented mr ripley with its hitchcock aspirations is a film strictly made for 12 year olds
<START> surprisingly good and quick witted adventure that features kelsey supposedly in his first lead role in a feature as an unconventional navy sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own however he has earn it by competing against the u s navy in a series of war games with a crew of untested questionable and lovable men and a woman too br br director david s ward major league and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand which they do quite well second besides the character most of the crew provide some or plenty of the movie's humor which is treated like a double edged sword three members of the supporting cast harland williams toby and rob schneider provide the funniest scenes which includes weird gestures impersonations and well their personalities br br down periscope is more than a navy version of police academy or the dirty dozen what the film does is get the job done the right way and i liked it
<START> i have seen this movie about 4 times and every time i am impressed with the second camera assistant's work seems trivial but there is something very professional knowledgeable and talented there the movie as a whole suffers from other problems as stated by other comments the significance so the issues being approached are as relevant today as it was 40 years ago the acting is a bit strained but the work of the second camera assistant is stellar this person needs to get back into the business perhaps directing what is this person waiting for i will be watching and waiting and cheering from the sidelines bob
<START> as a great fan of the hammer studios and enthusiastic watcher of their gothic horror films i wonder what took me so long to start watching their tv series hammer house of horror which only ran for one season in 1980 now that i've seen the first four episodes of the show i can say that it easily satisfies my expectations so far while this first episode witching time is maybe not the most imaginative horror story ever told and doesn't quite deliver the marvelous gothic atmosphere that i love hammer's films from the 50s to the 70s for it doubtlessly does accomplish to tell a surprisingly spooky tale and create some genuine creepiness within fifty minutes film score composer david winter jon finch is tormented by the 17th century witch lucinda patricia quinn while he story may be simple but for a running time of less than an hour it is effective and delivers many creepy moments northern irish actress patricia quinn who is probably best known for her role in the rocky horror picture show 1975 as well as the fantastic monty python comedy monty python's meaning of life 1983 is wonderfully malicious in her role which fits her like a glove jon finch is also quite good as david and while prunella gee who plays his adulterous actress wife may not be the best actress ever she is definitely nice to look at the episode is accompanied by a nice score which plays along well with the atmosphere overall witching time is a very entertaining episode with several truly creepy moments and decent opener to the series
<START> while i was watching this movie i never thought i'd be defending it it's honest enough from the about not having much of a plot there's no real characters to latch onto except the killer some of the acting can be better but most of it is capable br br i know a three out of ten isn't stellar but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely useless etc i think it set out to do what it's supposed to fairly well the lighting is minimal at times more natural than most audiences are used to but it's supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film in fact at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that but nobody would make it through minutes of camera work that's truly that bad br br it's not particularly scary but it is disturbing at times there are one or two characters who don't come across as believable at all and the soundtrack does get tiring at times but overall it was put together cleaner than a lot of camcorder movies
<START> final solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid it shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation jan ellis was taught that a black man was a plague he was raised to be that way br br then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs pastor will he change his ways the film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy the movie shows the world of how apartheid affected the psyche of blacks and whites br br this is a great film that everyone should watch
<START> the cure is a fantastic film about a boy with aids i've cried about 4 times watching this film and it's just so sad i can't promise everyone will cry watching this but it will make you want to very emotional and very sad the cure is a must see movie it shows you the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely great movie br br at first i didn't think it would be as great and wondered why my mum always cried watching it but now i know it's a stunning film that is so original and is so close to real life situations unlike most of the other films that doesn't make sense words cannot describe the greatness of the cure you just have to see it
<START> nothing more than a soccer knock off of the mighty ducks this film proved to be annoying in most aspects this was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours to say the least my younger sisters liked it but it proved to be too much like the far superior mighty ducks oh well at least olivia d'abo was hot and steve guttenberg still had a job at that point in time
<START> it was easy to dismiss this film as hyperbole at the time of its release fonda douglas and lemmon were known lefties but the accident at three island provided shocking context to this fictional drama br br this film works on many levels taking shots at both public utilities and tv news 1979 was the zenith of the infamous happy talk format of tv news see also ron burgundy and it's on display here in all its glory the sonorous anchor grimly reads a story about a grinding head on collision before cheerfully introducing kimberley wells fonda doing a story about a veterinarian who makes house or is that aquarium calls the show's producer and the station manager argue about content or lack thereof behind the scenes br br there are a few technical errors the pr flack james hampton shows fonda and douglas the requisite scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant built by later as lemmon and wilford brimley nicely playing lemmon's friend colleague caught between duty and loyalty fight a sudden crisis in the s control room they're obviously running a boiling water plant built by ge a small point but curious considering how many details the screenwriters got right br br like any good drama the film asks more questions than it answers the real world accident at proves the film's basic premise the working title for the film was originally power and you'll see why as nuclear power prepares to make a comeback in these days of 3 gas the china syndrome is as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago
<START> in new york a group of freshmen join the high school for the performing arts after being well succeeded in their audition for four years their dreams deceptions success love and personal dramas are disclosed though the insecure doris maureen the homosexual montgomery the aggressive leroy gene anthony ray the hopeful coco irene cara the ambitious ralph barry miller and their friends until their graduation day br br twenty eight years ago fame was a great success with the story of teenagers seeking a spot in the show business and i loved this movie and the soundtrack on cd i have just watched fame on dvd and presently i would say that it is a good movie with a great potential only but with too many flawed subplots the story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer i do not know whether alan parker had edition problems to reduce the running time of this movie but what happened for example with the ballerina that goes to a clinic for abortion what happened with leroy and his teacher did he fail due to his grammar problem what happened with coco after undressing her blouse in the apartment of that crook the musician that plays synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot anyway fame is still a delightful entertainment and a cult movie for me my vote is seven br br title brazil fame
<START> cameron diaz james marsden frank langella that's an all star power cast but the box proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie the premise sounds promising a couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollar the downside is that someone will die a person they probably will not know so what do you do this gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes after that the story derails completely vague an uninspired plot lines about an alien conspiracy involving the nasa nothing really is explained here br br the box is a disappointment could have been so much better but since it is based on an ultra short story that explains the continuity errors
<START> some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow br br some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience these won't directly feed you but they'll help you yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have and after all the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept br br and then there are movies that do neither of these things that you will watch out of obligation or because you have a need for historical context these are pretty worthless experiences in terms of building a life br br the problem is of course that often you don't know which of the three a film will be going in you might get some indication from people you trust but because a life in film is so personal you really won't know until you go on the blind date br br for me this was pretty worthless yes yes i know for many bunuel is the epitome of the sublime and rich and you should know if you don't that among my greatest film experiences are some very strange films very strange indeed br br it isn't that this isn't cinematic or symbolically deep or politically friendly to the way i think its how it gets there that is off base its the deviance from real deviance that annoys me br br part of the problem is that this is successful alternative art which means that it is successful commercial art which in turn means that it can be simply explained and the explanation is not only widely acceptable but simply coded in shorthand surely all this is true br br when the term surreal is used generally it is used incorrectly to denote any film image or world that differs from reality or seems strange but when it is used correctly meaning according to consensus theory it always revolves around bunuel and in particular this film and the one he genuinely did with dali so because they invented surreal cinema they define and control the term that by itself chafes me and i have my own alternative definition that doesn't come from their philosophy br br its because the philosophy is wholly contrary it isn't a philosophy at all but a rejection of philosophy an anti order its packaged anarchy carefully selecting the things that they use and the things they oppose without clearly differentiating them br br so okay against linearity against narrative against history against religion an easy one against deliberate love but for an linear narrative for establishing its own history celebrated by countless film school professors what else can they do for a sort of transcendent accidental love br br it is its own enemy if there were a bunuel alive today as he sold his image the first thing he would do is attack the church or the surreal br br my regular readers know that in nearly all matters cinematic i to the spanish and avoid the french but in the matter of the surreal i'd like to you consider the reverse get your surrealism from alfred not bunuel br br ted's evaluation 2 of 3 has some interesting elements
<START> quite a ways away from go fish both were good films but had a bigger budget and cast to work with here this film was very entertaining and easy to like the acting was good lots of slow burn sexual tension br br
