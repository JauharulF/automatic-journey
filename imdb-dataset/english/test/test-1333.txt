<START> if you haven't watched the movie yet but you do like comedy go out and buy or at least rent it the fact it won the animation oscar is not a coincidence i haven't watched many other wallace gromit movies in fact i think i only watched one other but the humor is very distinctive and some would also say very british in a good way of course br br the story will only be an excuse for all the jokes to come but although it's not the most elaborate one it still works by the way my niece did guess see one of the big surprises coming i didn't kudos to her o i do think that after you watch this one you'll go out and seek the other w g movies that are out there have fun
<START> it's just a bad film not as bad as r i c c o but bad it got me hooked at the then totally lost me after that the acting was way off then on then going way way way off do not see this movie at all costs trust me with all my heart the directors who are brothers are not the next hughes brothers who made really great films like dead presidents from hell american pimp and menace ii society the only person who made me watch this was the acting of paris campbell who will be a great actor one day if he makes better films than this christina also did a nice job for what she got i hope the fittest is 10 times better than this piece of crap
<START> monster of mexico i do agree is the weakest of the modern scooby doo movies mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it all was loch ness monster however is a considerable improvement with gorgeous animation honestly scotland looked beautiful the music is good and the plot is well thought out plus there is some great dialogue and the voice acting was fabulous with casey kasem a consistent delight as shaggy and the beautiful scottish singer sheena a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role in fact my only complaints were some strange accents in one or two members of the voice cast with the exception of whose accent did sound genuine and somehow the loch ness monster wasn't as well designed as it had potential to be overall a solid and enjoyable scooby doo film 8 10 bethany cox
<START> this is one of the best presentations of the 60's put on film arthur penn director of bonnie and clyde and little big man saw that steve outstanding script rang with truth and from these two talents comes solid cinema jodi georgia miles gives male viewers a hit of pained nostalgia for the archetypal beauty who is almost within our grasps but always just out of reach just see it or you cinematic education will be incomplete
<START> this movies is really special it's about a young french who go in barcelona spain in order to study and in he meets other youngs like him this film he's the european movies of the year so go watch it
<START> the concept of this movie is pretty compelling zombie children climbing out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in the backwoods of pennsylvania cool the problem i had with the movie is the lack of creativity when dealing with the zombies the makers could have really spiced this film up with some terror like imagery a la the ring such as stop action reverse camera walking or stuff like that when the zombie children are strolling through the woods they look like a bunch of 9 year olds walking to a playground in west philadelphia instead of pick axes and shovels they could have easily been carrying baseball bats and gloves why would i fear these little kids anyone could just run away in a straight line to safety also who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in that creepy run down house the moment i opened that front door and looked around i would have said mm hmm mm hmm son go start the car i'm going around back to pee on a bush and then we're out of here totally unbelievable movie don't waste your time
<START> i really liked the far cry game nice graphics good level design interesting and clever enemies above average length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by default against movie spin offs of games i thought doom the movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the length the movie runs only a merciful 90 min the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story and come on genetically modified soldiers they could have come up with some better name br br however this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not believe they were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i think i'll get hypothermia although everybody is wearing t shirts we need to cuddle together for body warmth is that your gun but but weren't there people who consciously did this there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a gaffer an electrician some food guy why didn't anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this film done by ravaging inhuman genetically modified film people i won't start at ranting about how many logical errors inconsistencies and scriptwriting flaws there were but even to the die hard action fan this can't be anything but insulting br br this film did actually ask for being rated 2 out of 10 so i'll do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from special effects nah acting not really references to the game you wish wait they used the font from the game for the title and the credits that was neat br br if you are looking for a flick for a bad movie night go for 2012 supernova this one is just sad

<START> being a huge die hard monkey island fan i this one would be terrible since ron gilbert didn't make it boy was i surprised although it's still not as good as the first two it has the comedy that i wanted i was a little nervous about the new graphics new engine and just the fact that it was on a cd but it all came together and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters i especially enjoyed that sword fighting had returned and the whole story about finding the big ring was just incredible go ahead and try out this two cd adventure and now we can rejoice because monkey island 4 escape from monkey island is coming out really really soon this fall
<START> from the portrayals of andy warhol in the films i shot andy warhol and this is the type of movie i would predict andy warhol might make airy illogical snobbish amoral the movie's almost non existent plot which is sometimes unbelievable is offset by the movie's rough real looking cinematography the film has a way of being unreal yet dictating reality to the viewer the only worthwhile part of the movie is the development of the relationship between joe and holly and every thing in it should be viewed as a characterization device there are a couple of comical scenes that i do admit are funny but trash is really just about a character study of unengaging people that is mildly enjoyable if you do not mind watching nudity and i v drug use
<START> this movie is astonishingly poor it was on television when i tuned in during an action scene and was chuckling away at the cheesy macho dialogue waiting for leslie nielsen to appear it took me a couple of minutes to realise that it wasn't actually a comedy it was meant to be taken seriously what has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie and worse still other people funded it and gave it the green light br br rutger hauer obviously doesn't read movie scripts before he signs up either that or he has some seriously bad debts to pay br br strangely this film is so poor that you find yourself staring at it wondering how it actually got funded and how a tv channel must have paid money for the rights to air it the dialogue between hero and baddie whilst trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly painful with dialogue sounding like it was generated by a texas speak spell br br the hollywood money machine at it's worst funny though
<START> quirky vulnerable raw honest and a treat to watch i'm not here to give a summary or synopsis of the film i simply wish to congratulate this small film with the great big heart i tip my hat to the filmmaker and it's excellent cast if you want to know what happens in the film then go see it michael writer director has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter suicide with great compassion comedy and empathy i see a great career ahead for mr this film works right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender honest moments between david and natasha as with every movie we need to suspend some disbelief yet i found with max and grace i was easily transported and completely convinced with it's surreal moments i only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further mr has pulled some wonderful performances from this already talented cast for instance guillermo performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving the colossus ralf former mr olympiad as a terrified patient perfect i can go on and on this independent feature has the star power of a big budget hollywood film however you forget about the stars on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story the real star here is the brilliant screenplay i look forward to seeing more from writer director michael
<START> once again john madden has given us a magnificent film a simple but beautiful story located in a real paradise and the music can't be better stephen warbeck delights us once more and good actings but why on earth is penelope cruz in this film i asked myself that same question while watching this movie of course her greek accent is not believable she's of acting decently not even in one scene not even at the end she did a good job after so many events after years she finally gets to see again and she couldn't change the same face of we had to bear during the whole film anyway cage was very good in one of his best characters hurt also is great in his and the rest of the cast all did a great job so the final result is a movie that really is worth of watching this is a beautiful film that not even mrs cruz was able to spoil so far i think it's madden best work so no fan will be disappointed
<START> pointless movie about making a movie no where near the flesh shown in the original which was quite enjoyable and even had fun music not here br br it's always fun seeing the guy though
