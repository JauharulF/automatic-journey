<START> ok i got the dvd set last week and i am finally getting around to posting my reviews but i sure liked this sequel in many ways br br zombie bloodbath 2 rage of the undead ok this one movies at a fast clip has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style i would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish dv shot flicks that i have bought most of the time i get rather angry at dv movies for being boring and looking like soap operas even a movie like bone sickness that i like has incredible stretches of dull not this movie it never stops long enough to let you catch your breath although i wouldn't say i liked it better than the first film i will say that sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films this one has better gore the inevitable zombie feeding scenes scumbag characters and a few returning actors although their roles are different mainly jerry angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell the shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film some of it works and some of it doesn't but i have to say that at least he wasn't just trying to do a larger version of the first film there was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical just satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life so i say kudos to mr sheets for trying to do something different with this one i give this film two bloody thumbs up
<START> for those of you still in the dark i will not spoil this christie as it is definitely one of her finest works and i stress that you should see it whenever you next have free time if any of the adaptations are to be watched before or in lieu of reading the book i would suggest after the funeral for the following reasons br br i wanted to praise the performance by monica dolan miss gilchrist whose employer companion cora is brutally murdered at the outset of the film her portrayal of a shocked nervous insignificant woman is actually moving especially when she has a moment of personal connection with poirot another person who travels alone in the journey of life and when the murderer is being revealed in typical poirot denouement fashion reactions to the revelation are acting at its finest you feel as angry at the murderer as you do sympathetic to miss gilchrist something uncommon in christie lore br br although there are a couple of discrepancies between novel and film adaptation as per usual the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film the unbelievably lavish recreation of post war england thoroughly high calibre of acting and directing and preservation if not heightening of christie's mystery and intrigue render these discrepancies insignificant br br bravo suchet dolan and the whole team for crafting this masterpiece of murder mystery theatre and the producers who gave it the green light encore
<START> stephanie meyer is going to be so ticked now her book breaking dawn will not be first with that title sorry twilight fans br br kelly the ring two is medical student eve who is assigned to interview psychotic don james haven angelina jolie's brother i suspected the twist and when she found out they both grew up in the same town i was sure of it br br she kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that i felt there was a shared delusion going on at times she even acted like she had ptsd i really thought she was losing it br br well she wasn't losing it and when the end came i was floored my whole suspicion turned out to be wrong the twist was even more amazing than i believed br br was fantastic and the story is so much better than something stephanie meyer would come up with a must see
<START> a romp across a disbelieving outback this adventure enchants through it's downright comedy from the clashing confrontation of cultural assumptions as drama from crisis perhaps a little too queenie for some i would love to have watched in a cinema audience in the outback shockingly good
<START> a potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the actors very little to work with roth covers it up as best he can by being all mouth hurt has about as much menace as a fluffy bunny and stamp can't seem to decide whether he's playing an ex london crook or some straight off the playing fields at eton as for poor laura del sol she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern idea of the stereotypical latino woman who's all pouts and hot temperament if you're a fan of any of the main actors don't disappoint yourself or fool yourself as i suspect many of the other reviewer's here have done watch it by all means but stay critical you know these guys can do better
<START> the feature length cgi movie has just been released this year but whilst it will provide kids a lot of entertainment for die hard alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60s and 80s versions of the cartoon shows the chipmunk adventure is probably the best alvin and the chipmunks based animated movie ever br br for starters the animation is as ever terrific the character designs are as they should be in the cartoons unlike the motion picture film itself it is just sheer fun to watch there are no celeb voices no cgi generated effects just pure quality 2 d hand drawn animation and the colours are fantastic bright bold and beautiful the jokes and humour is typical chipmunk standard and the narrative is spot on in truth the chipmunk adventure is everything the live action movie ought to have been but isn't alvin simon and theodore compete with the jeanette and britney in a hot air balloon contest and along the way the kids encounter all manner of problems and dilemmas that they have to resolve in their own way and no chipmunk movie is complete without the odd renditions of classic rock and pop anthems br br the chipmunk adventure is for kids and adults alike which is another advantage over the cgi movie as whereas the 2007 version will gain a few new admirers the 1987 movie will appeal to both young and older chipmunk fans and provide the helium like voices of the film's trio br br overall this film is a must for fans of the cartoon shows themselves you will not be left disappointed if you have seen the live action version then you'll feel that this movie is a much better effort in contrast if you haven't then you should go and see it still or even still forget the jason lee movie and as an alternative stick with this
<START> zachary scott does what he does best i e plays a worm in danger signal a 1945 b movie also starring faye emerson mona freeman and rosemary decamp scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money on the lam from his last murder he rents a room in the home owned by the family hilda emerson and her mother mary scott throws himself at emerson and she's dazzled mid romance her younger sister anne freeman comes home from a medical treatment when she mentions that she was uncle favorite and he left her 25 000 big bucks by 1945 standards scott loses interest in poor hilda and makes a play for anne anne looks like rebecca of sunnybrook farm until she starts sneaking around with scott overnight she ages 10 years and becomes downright nasty to her sister finally getting the message that her tenant is no good hilda calls in a psychiatrist rosemary decamp to psyche him out and advise her br br psychological dramas were all the rage during and after world war ii and scott does an excellent job as a smooth sociopath this was his forte as a weak willed sheriff in flamingo road he exhibited no real presence as for two timing we saw him do that in mildred pierce where he proved himself particularly good at it emerson is a bookish stenographer with her hair pushed off her face and her big glasses but after hours she's lovely and gives a strong performance decamp was always an underrated actress here she sports a soft german accent and is delightful br br this is a highly entertaining film though a very routine story the acting truly elevates it
<START> camp blood looked great when i was buying it but when i watched it boy was i wrong its tacky the acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is shocking being a movie fan i usually find humour from tragic horror but at times i couldn't even laugh maybe camp blood 2 will be an improvement
<START> what is it about certain films that generates such polar opposite reactions br br some people here have called high roller disgusting some have called it extraordinary as would i actually br br why i think it's because films like this don't make heroes out of jerks or glamour out of degeneration and some people just can't deal with that emotionally they need a hero and i'd also add that if they're gamblers or poker players they might feel personally betrayed when their existence isn't justified br br high roller in not a poker movie it's a people movie it's not perfect but it looks good is well written and wonderfully acted and best of all it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection br br and maybe that's what makes some people so damn mad
<START> the kite runner is one of the most controversial films of the year and it's not just one of those controversies invented by pr people to sell tickets no this is a film that was actually pulled from release because the producers began to fear for their safety of their actors that may give you an idea of just how sensitive and topical some of the material is the kite runner is an important film for our modern world because now more than ever we need stories that show the reality of war not just action movies that glamorize the violence it was adapted from the best selling book and some critics have charged that something was lost in translation but if you don't bring the baggage of the novel into the screening you will be very moved
<START> one of the more obscure of anthony mann's westerns the last frontier was also his only cavalry western aside from one brief episode in winchester '73 though naturally he focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals set not in his beloved high country but in the foothills and forests it's a much more cynical view of life of the frontier in many ways his fort apache without the need to preserve the legend this outpost is made up of misfits failures cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors badly led while the civil war takes priority and all the best the army has to offer br br victor mature and james whitmore are the free who find civilisation creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the cavalry into their territory rather than blame the indians for their losses they decide it's the army's fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead but despite the best efforts of guy madison's amiable and competent acting commander to bring mature into the 19th century and make him fit to wear the uniform the arrival of robert preston's humiliated colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost Â and mature's clumsy infatuation with the colonel's wife anne bancroft too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who's tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her Â soon drive matters into much darker territory it's not long before some of the soldiers are planning on killing each other both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them little wonder that at one point mature throws away the he has long coveted in disgust screaming i would have died for this but it's nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag the stallone of his day mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director this is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part perversely enough as a simple man Â well meaning but drunk violent uneducated and with a unsubtle almost childlike lust for life the part seems designed with burt lancaster in mind with some striking similarities to his character in the but robert preston's ahab like colonel is clearly the best role determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal civil war engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board in his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption driven as much by his sense of shame at his wife's sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he regards as his inferiors he's beyond salvation but there's still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity Â he genuinely admires madison's courage in making a futile attempt to get preston's orders by their superiors Â fatally skewed though it is br br like its hero the film is a little rough around the edges and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any western but that only tends to make it more interesting and there are plenty of mann's typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive unfortunately the deficiencies of the early cinemascope lenses are very apparent in columbia's dvd with the image often dark 2 55 1 cinemascope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early scope films show a lot of trial and error and grainy
<START> ever once in a while i run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad i wonder why movies exist this is one of them this is a terrible attempt to parody the godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and bad dialogue eddie is just plain annoying as tony an annoying twit who upon his father don william hickey 's request takes over the family business tony as i said is an annoying little twit this makes the whole movie a complete mess the movie is terribly daffy it's too cartoonish the main point i'm trying to make is that you can't make a parody of an acclaimed drama like the godfather with so much cartoonishness it doesn't work that way believe it or not you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously if you don't take it seriously it will feel too much like a parody the thing about doing a parody is that you can't seem too much like you're doing a parody you have to make it seem like you're taking the movie at least a little bit seriously it also feels like they're just mocking woody allen and that's what makes this movie absolutely terrible
<START> i've seen comments from turkish people which i'm not saying this movie is fantastic and accurately portrays turkish life all i have to say is turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world because in my opinion that is exactly what this movie was to me if i were turkish i think it would have had a greater impact but if you're not from turkey i would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on this br br distant seems to lag on forever many scenes are painstakingly long with little or no purpose i don't understand the director's objectives in even including many of the scenes it is pointed out that the director used his own car apartment and friends in making the movie well guess what it shows it looks low budget the acting is poor if it's a cultural thing then so be it i just don't understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story it's unbelievably boring
<START> overall i'd call this a disappointing performance it attempts the old horror anthology approach but fails miserably the acting was bad and so were the stories any skin shown in the movie was obviously random just to attract the r rating for sex typical i guess but bad nonetheless take your 5 and rent a real movie instead
<START> i haven't laughed this hard since granny got caught in the wringer says one of the potheads in this hilarious quasi spoof of all those val lewton and george a romero walking dead movies we have come to love or loath depending on your personal taste through the years br br in this story a young actor pair play a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troupe after one spooky night they visit a cemetery island their artistic director alan pretends to bring the dead back to life by conducting a highly stylized ritual br br way too much screen time is misspent the amateur dialog includes lame witticisms melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler commentaries and can't alan stop that irritating laughter way too much once the action kicks in which comes close to the end of this film it's worth the wait br br i saw this one on a late night local station television program that ran films very much like this one only this one scared me at the age of 13 but then again you might laugh your way through it until the bitter end which is probably the reason nowadays why very few people still wear striped hip huggers
