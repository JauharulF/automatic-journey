<START> spoilers this review has been edited due to word limit br br the horror the horror ' marlon brando apocalypse now 1979 and apocalypse now redux 2001 br br the sentence which is as famous as here's looking at you kid ' or are you talkin' to me ' or may the force be with you ' or i'll be back ' means a little more than some one liners when it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed what might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame br br what exactly does this line of dialogue mean the horror spoken of is the reality of war the reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt when capt willard martin sheen stands before the dying col kurtz marlon brando at the end of the film the horror the horror ' is the realization of willard's he has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment this isn't a typical hollywood ending in most cases a character gains something whether it be emotionally physically mentally or all three but willard both gains and loses he gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals and that is a shocking ending br br apocalypse now' is francis ford coppola's tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking this film is wholly different from the godfather ' it is hallucinogenic visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature at first it seems realistic and then it becomes strange and then symbolic and by the end original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare this is not as much a film about the vietnam war as it is a film about the war within us br br at first it does appear to be another war film captain willard sheen is assigned by an army lieutenant a young harrison ford to assassinate a renegade american colonel named kurtz brando who is hiding out somewhere in vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves br br willard carries out his mission with extreme prejudice ' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers including the boat captain chief albert hall chef frederic forest and a very young larry' fishburne who later went on to appear as morpheus in the matrix' br br apocalypse now is in a many ways a modern update of homer's odyssey as our main character willard carries on his journey he meets an array of original and strange characters including lt col robert duvall who has a strange fetish for surfing and a stoned photographer dennis hopper whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser jeremy davies in the million dollar hotel one of the worst films i have ever seen davies failed to make any connection with an audience hopper does he is like the poetic vibe between willard and kurtz he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages in this case he is translating kurtz to willard although i'm not so sure kurtz needs a translation of willard br br many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines apocalypse now has many descending upon a vietnam village playing wagner's ride of the valkyries remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history there is sharpness to it a brutality to it an ironic tone to it and also a sense of playfulness when kneels down on that beach and says i love the smell of napalm in the morning it smells like victory ' we all crack a smile br br i won't lie to you apocalypse now' is a strange film it isn't exactly the easiest thing to analyze the end may frustrate some viewers if they don't understand marlon brando's significant speeches but what it all comes down to what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche the horror is the realization of war and its effects not the war itself kurtz says you have a right to kill me but you have no right to judge me ' brando's character kurtz is left to the audience to judge to many naÃ¯ve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head but that isn't what francis ford coppola is trying to get across by fighting in vietnam kurtz has realized just how great he had it and how bad some others had it by walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the naÃ¯ve ones living our lives in a fool's paradise we are totally naÃ¯ve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit by seeing how unlucky some vietnamese are kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something just how easily he could end up like the people around him and he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door many people think the horror is one thing it is two for kurtz the horror is the reality of how naÃ¯ve he was and the reality of the war's impact upon men and after willard murders kurtz and hears dying words he realizes it too he realizes the effects of war to see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man and what it has done to him the horror br br 5 5 stars br br
<START> in the spirit of the great space coaster but a few years earlier br br hot fudge was one of the psychedelic kid's shows that i grew up on seymour was a big fuzzy green puppet with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head i recall him wearing a variety of elton john type shades br br he played piano and had a jesus looking dude in a white tux sitting next to him they would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it br br don't remember much else except the opening theme seymour and the hippie br br no one else i know remembers it at all i grew up in jersey so if it was produced in detroit as a previous post said it wasn't just local seymour reminded me a lot of sherlock the squirrel from the magic garden another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one people always talk about effects of music and movies of the 70s but it seems kid's show writers got a dose as well
<START> the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56 but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuve's appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and x comes across as a student's imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration
<START> this is a wonderfully gritty drama detailing the various sides of the international heroin drug trade from the hills of northern pakistan where the tacitly allowed cultivation of opium occurs on a vast scale to the euro trash in germany and england who arrange the of processed heroin in multi kilo smuggled shipments to the end users caught up in the web of addiction and the crime needed to support their growing habit and finally all the levels of international government corruption and hypocrisy surrounding police efforts at controlling the drug problem this drama is sketched out with a wide array of in depth well rounded characters fully evolved plot and excellent character acting and location shooting br br this puts hollywood epics like the french connection in their place br br is a deeply thought provoking and suspenseful tale of modern drug related espionage and the international efforts of many people to try to eliminate it br br unlike many crime dramas revolving around drugs strongly on uncovering the societal reasons that people slide into drug addiction as one of the characters puts it until we as a society construct a world that people want to participate in instead of wanting to escape from we will not be able to stop people from taking drugs br br this is a fascinating and fully engrossing drama i highly recommend it
<START> this is a masterful piece of film making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian self indulgent wartime years that span the aerial of london and the outward of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self sacrifice and more a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close up camera angle and lighting including faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work a very rare type of film these days it holds the attention and stirs the emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative superficial shortcuts
<START> seen all 4 installments this one is by far the best of all i did'nt have much expectation when i got the dvd 3rd was such a drag but to my delight this one was fast paced with some slick punch lines br br don't miss this one
<START> it seems that there is great potential for the story line of this film to be something worth watching the acting was flat and the story lacked depth there was too much reliance on camera work which had some high points i have to agree with the other negative comments i only wish i had read them before buying the dvd the film may be worth watching for free and you are bored to tears before hand there could have been a lot more plot development with why there are homeless in moscow i e post soviet rampant drug usage i e increased heroin trafficking from afghanistan more development of why the resurgence of russian orthodoxy after the fall of the u s s r the archaeologists themselves or even more into the struggle against nihilism
<START> is what is wrong with indie films for all of their hard edged commentary and attacking big subjects studios won't this is the sacrifice we make for nearly two hours i was subjected to the torture and pain of a film that starts by wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering any new ground and thankfully dies br br there are parallel stories that detail a dying town and a dying boy two men dressed in black one of them james woods must coerce the remaining inhabitants of northfork to leave before a dam opens up and floods the town the other story has a boy returned to the priest nick nolte that gave him to the parents he is dying and is visited i guess by angels among them anthony edwards with bizarre spectacles and daryl hannah in a bizarre costume reminding me of the pirate shirt from seinfeld br br though this is the plot it is not what the film is about the film is about nothing it does nothing says nothing goes nowhere and has nothing interesting to show perhaps by design more likely an after effect of the pretentious surreal david lynch wannabe we're an important artsy film can't you see style of direction the entire movie is filtered through a gray bleak backdrop that i suppose fits a film about death instead it simply makes the film that much harder to watch br br if you want to see a film about men in black see either 'men in black' films neither too impressive but compared to they are lifted to 'citizen kane' status if you want to see a film about a boy dying watch oil ' if you want to see a film that has the destruction of a town through water watch 'o brother where art thou ' if you want to watch a film better than ' there are hundreds if you want to watch a film that is worse there are only a handful 0 out of
<START> everybody interested in texas needs to have this dvd it's just a good movie about real texas with great scenes it took a bunch of texans to do this right hollywood never would have gotten it there are so many subtle things that put in the movie and may not have even thought about but it makes the show br br guest cameos are not seen as cameos at all each star fits in perfectly and does not distract from the film many of the guests spots blend so perfect that when the credits roll you will go back through the movie to find the character roll is dead on it could not have been done any better in real life br br the second half of the movie is completely different from the first it get's a little hokey but that's alright somehow the storyline works the hokey stuff is like an after school special but it looks believable and natural br br i have never heard anyone use the sonny pruitt line before other than locals that i grew up with that was the icing on the cake for me br br definitely a collectible right up there with pure country express jr bonner texasville the last picture show giant and of course hud br br '86
<START> when i saw the first octopus movie it was a laugh see the cheesy acting and appalling effects this film seemed to make up for the acting but not the special effects after jaws and piranha sure why not make a film about a killer octopus the octopus invades the new york waters where 2 police investigators try stopping the rampaging beast before the 4th of july br br a pretty clean plot and descent happenings but the octopus was pretty much appalling its nice to see they actually made it this time but it looked like a piece of plastic better on a big budget really this film could have been a good watch there's a continuous amount of errors where it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't research the way octopus live br br watch this if you like cheap dvd sequels otherwise your better watching jaws
<START> solomon and sheba was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the late 50's when i was a kid a biblical epic spectacular with well known performers unusual costumes lots of extras and battle sequences so i went to see it but i remember that back then solomon and sheba didn't impress me at all which was a strange thing since i had enjoyed a lot the ten commandments quo vadis helen of troy and others the point is that when you are a kid you disregard things in pictures that adults don't bad acting for instance and you are easier to please with warriors in their armors battles sword duels and action so if your'e not impressed then something is wrong with a product of this genre br br this film though it has some of such features is definitely standard and average yul wooden performance as the hebrew king doesn't even light when he has voluptuous and half naked gina lollobrigida dancing around him provocatively she is better and renders an acceptable acting george sanders doesn't look interested in what he is doing and marisa pier twin sister doesn't add at all as a sort of conscience br br the final sword duel between brynner and sanders is just for the plot and lacks interest and intensity it had to filmed that's all br br not a good farewell for director king vidor solomon and sheba will probably be remembered as ty power's last unfinished picture
<START> i viewed the reader at sugar which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening the technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that duncan rogers had chosen his designers and crew well but it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine duncan rogers' tight script was just what this evening of shorts needed it neither meandered as several offerings did or preached to us the reader was simple story telling in it's best form well cast by rogers and beautifully acted duncan rogers is obviously a director with the ability to put all the pieces together i'm looking forward to his next finished project k
<START> after reading both river god and the seventh scroll i can't begin to express how disappointed i was with this film while i agree some poetic license may be admissible this movie is at constant variance with the books doing an incredible injustice to the exciting plausible and wonderful stories written by wilbur smith i can only believe that the writers director and producers of the movie have never even heard of mr smith let alone read his work smith's vibrant characterizations are converted into wooden stick figures all historicity is ignored or discounted the realism of the books has been changed to include phantom monsters more appropriate to a cartoon and why is an egyptian henchman speaking spanish no wonder the movie was made into a tv miniseries did wilbur smith have any input into the making of this movie i can't believe that he did terrible terrible movie if you've read either or both of the books don't waste your time or money watching this money you will be sorely disappointed i assure you br br only a moment of supreme generosity persuaded me to give this movie a ranking of '2' and that only because of the beautiful sometimes spectacular photography
<START> gordon goes over the top in typical full moon fashion but that's to be expected combs is surprisingly low key keeping his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing also gone is the usual stuart gordon in black humor br br the film is quite effective in showing combs' break down and his final heroic act to save his wife daughter you actually feel sympathy for his character despite his short comings br br personally i was more surprised at the nudity and borderline porno sex scene than i was shocked by the graphic violence gore br br not classic gordon but certainly something you might enjoy if you've seen his more famous films
<START> leland follows the story of leland p fitzgerald ryan gosling a disaffected teenager who has apparently murdered a severely retarded peer the brother of a girl he was dating the issue is not whether he did it or not Â leland admits to it straight away Â but rather why interestingly rather than a crime drama leland becomes a character story examining why people do what they do Â not necessarily the easiest ground to till br br and leland features the required indie group of screwed up people aside from the title character there's also pearl don cheadle who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility and who sees straight off that leland is different we meet distant and egotistical father kevin spacey in an extended cameo who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did but the real flavorings come out when we immerse ourselves in the the family of the retarded child first there's girlfriend becky jena malone a drug addict who can't keep herself clean her sister julie michelle williams perhaps the most normal person in the film who merely seeks to get away from it all and allen harris chris klein a young man who lives with the and is julie's boyfriend lastly there's ryan michael welch whom all the others call goofball who cannot communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings br br leland focuses primarily on its eponymous protagonist but the movie slowly Â occasionally too slowly Â burrows into everyone's lives asking the chief question why do people do what they do while leland discusses it openly in a journal pearl allows him to keep examining notions of good and bad and personal responsibility all the characters at some point in the film face a moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or another's perhaps the most basic choice any human can make and the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices and the consequences of them br br in the beginning of the film you're simply struck by the depth of the cast spacey cheadle gosling michelle williams even chris klein Â these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in and putting them all together makes for a heady brew for a space in the middle the film seems to stall sputtering along as it unfolds it looks for a while as if it will be content merely to ask questions and not supply any answers but when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie starts to hit its stride and come together leland becomes a quietly powerful piece of film making explanation of the world and his actions in the end bring every story into focus and all the investment you've made in the film pays off br br saying ryan gosling is excellent is like saying a sunny day is nice at this point in his career it's redundant Â this is one of the finest young actors working today and it is a pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into a thought provoking protagonist gosling employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting he has to face off most of the film opposite don cheadle whom we know has the goods and he not only holds his own he elevates cheadle's game as well cheadle himself is in top notch form imbuing pearl with a fully rounded humanity Â for good and bad spacey is kind of one note but that's the character and he handles it excellently i was surprised by chris klein with this level of acting i thought he would be buried in the mix but he gives probably the turn of his career so far terrific work all around br br leland is a bit of a downer and again it's draggy in spots but it finishes strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer on this one anyway there's also a subtle commentary on racism in the film in first day in juvenile hall class he's the only white person in the room that like much of the movie is very effectively handled i wouldn't go so far as to call this required viewing Â some might find it too slow or too odd Â but i thought it was one of the better films i've seen in a while far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there i'd recommend it Â with the above caveats Â if for no other reason than to watch gosling further perfect his craft
