<START> for those of you who have no idea what bug juice is or was it was a children's reality show about real kids living at summer camp bug juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp it was full of romance friendships fights overcoming your fears and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for 2 months it was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t v regularly but is amazing non the less the show was never dull and always attracted my attention it's really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it's like before going plus disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show that's at a camp for like only a week the length of the camps where perfect for this show and the environment they where in was fantastic they where camps all over the u s that each provided unique activities for the campers it was a truly amazing unscripted show
<START> your ability to enjoy the ashes of time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film br br unlike most hk actioners the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance when they do happen they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen the dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful with the of maggie cheung brigitte lin and a roll call of top acting talent chewing up the scenery as with some of wong kar wai's early work the dialog could be more precise br br in short the ashes of time requires a forgiving attitude released around the same time as wong kar wai's spectacularly successful chungking express it's clear that the director isn't as confident working with the elements of the martial arts film anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed but those intrigued by the director's aesthetic will likely find this a unique experience at the very least
<START> this movie was completely stale and uninspired the central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfunny repartee i did not laugh one time during the entire movie i could have sat in any barbershop in america and have heard this banal banter and maybe have even come out with a decent haircut i cannot understand why this mess got any favourable reviews much less why so many people have wasted money on this none of the characters here were funny or worth caring about i really didn't care whether the rival barbershop across the street would cause nappy to go out of business don't waste your money on this one folks as that is the only way to get hollywood to stop churning out these shambolic pieces of rubbish 1 out of 5
<START> there is nothing i hate more in a movie than pretentiousness and this is one of the most pretentious films ever made it's self consciousness is obvious in every frame see what a profound sophisticated film we are making the director and screenwriters seem to be saying to us and to themselves they say see how we can bore and confuse the audience even more i would rather watch the worst film by ed wood or edgar g ulmer than something like this at least they were giving us honest trash and at least their films in their own atrocious way were entertaining this film is about as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia and thus is tantamount to torture br br have these screenwriters ever heard the word 'story ' it doesn't appear so they have a concept they are able to create an atmosphere and they were able to assemble an excellent cast and elicit good performances from them and for what to bore us for an hour and 45 minutes nothing really happens in this film the only exciting part and this lasts only about two minutes occurs when one of the soon to be evicted homeowners starts shooting at the state employees who come to tell him he has to leave but nothing comes of it too bad he didn't keep shooting until he hit the screenwriters the only redeeming features of this film are the acting and some beautifully photographed scenery toward the end 3 10
<START> i decided i need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film unlike other war films that focus on the event apocalypse now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip the sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable yet you can't lay your eyes off of it based off of joseph conrad's heart of darkness apocalypse now slowly descends its protagonist willard martin sheen into madness most likely the same way kurtz plunged into insanity the production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for brando's unprepared performance he read his lines from cue cards there is a documentary titled apocalypse now a filmmakers apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this br br the opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film as the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees the song the end by the doors can be heard the next shot is of willard in his bed with the fan on so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan we are informed that he does special missions for the military mostly assassinations when his next mission is given to him he is baffled charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the indy 500 the man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped willard does not go alone however he is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles along the way they meet lieutenant colonel bill hoorah about the war willard ponders that if is that crazy what could kurtz be like there are many scenes that portray plunge into insanity the tiger attack the slaughter of innocent vietnamese the nonstop rain the piled dead bodies scattered about and the deaths of his crew members when he reaches the kurtz compound he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist dennis hopper instead of assassinating kurtz right away willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do kurtz on the other hand wants to die he is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier willard kills him with a machete while in unison a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people once they realize their leader has been slain instead of killing willard they hail him as their new king willard rejects the offer and leaves them br br the cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking the colors are grain free something that is rare in older movies i can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery br br the acting ensemble is terrific with everyone playing their parts well many criticize brando for some reason but i think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war br br the soundtrack and the score are haunting and provide the mood for the film i am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar like sound when the credits roll there have been many parodies of this film but my favorite quote comes from marge simpson when she explains to homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot your character provides comic relief for the show like um marlon brando in apocalypse now those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious
<START> i hate films about sports i guess the pre fabricated hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year what i am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre use exhibit a Â the game plan as evidence of this if you want so needless to say i was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element but at the same time i couldn't wait because i love surfing documentaries like step into liquid and billabong odyssey i took a step i plunged into the unknown and to be honest at first i wasn't happy i didn't like the direction the people or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport with my first viewing i thought that history couldn't be fully recorded so i thought stacy peralta was splicing stock footage with faux actors acting like they were from the late 70s the music was intense it matched well peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment but the visuals were anything but stimulating the elongated scenes while using amazing music to support just seemed flushed and too long for my attention i wanted to get to know the pioneers not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool i wanted a combination of who these kids were where they went during their rise of fame and where they are now it felt like i was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day i wanted to know the men behind the myths br br then with a thought that i would have another negative review under my belt i watched the film again with peralta's audio commentary his passion his voice his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished wow ed me this suddenly transformed into the film i wanted to see peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today what they are still doing and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera he hadn't seen many of them in 20 years so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface he was sincere he was sympathetic yet he showed so much dedication to this project while i do not agree with everything that he chose to do i e the sean penn mess up is not punk rock he revitalized this film for me it was due to this commentary that i rate this film much higher than originally thought br br jay adams tony jeff ho peggy these are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned and continually praised if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees while tony hawk's name sells products it is these guys these mild mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport sure others were probably doing it in the stone ages but these guys did it with style grace and moved it to the next level this was a hobby for them but it also propelled them in a direction i believe none of them were ready for dogtown and z boys is the story of evolution being in the right place at the right time living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted and about friendship we have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity and this is definitely a story that should be added to that i cannot say that i loved this film nor will i but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend it was sad it was emotional and these guys aren't multi millionaires over again Â they are people with a passion and very rarely do you see that in documentaries br br overall i cannot watch this film again but i will suggest it to friends and family time after time i think the downfall for this film to me was the filming Â the attempts to be avant garde with the style which ultimately drew away from the characters and events as mentioned before there were some elements that dragged on too much which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now peralta obviously had a passion for this sport for the people but he seemed out of focus at times the music was intense and worked perfectly with the film sean penn while he was decent with his voice over wasn't needed at all they could have spent the money elsewhere on the positive the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing peralta's voice instead of penn's brings a stronger human element to the scene while he tells us better stories of the people places and events watch this film but don't expect to be blown away listen to the audio commentary i think you will be impressed br br grade Â½ out of
<START> i've read plenty of jane austen in my time and approve of several cinema tv adaptations but this one we just don't need br br rating is a 2 as i wouldn't say it's awful just so boring you will feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life dull script matched by even duller acting i've heard billie piper is ok in dr who not a fan so can't confirm but in this she just sucks there is absolutely no chemistry between the leads this is austen it's supposed to be a romance br br please don't let this put you off austen or historical dramas there are plenty of better programmes to view
<START> when i attended college in the early 70s it was a simpler time except for a brief occurrence in 1994 i've been totally free of the influence of illegal substances ever since and i've never regretted it until now db has got to be hands down the best movie to watch when stoned the odd dreamlike state it creates is very strange when you're not smoking anything but i'm sure that it would seem completely normal after a big doobie not that i'm recommending this you understand the soothing narration provided as it usually is in quality cinema by a tb victim trapped in a painting would be ideal to help the stoned viewer to follow along as things get complicated plus everything in the film is pretty organic from old fashioned natural breasts to the bucket of fried chicken br br now there's also no question that the young man with the ahem hand problem is absolutely sailing away in the film at one point you just know that he's going to say hey when i move my hand it leaves trails trust me you'll know when you get to that point br br the only other thing we have to address is this how good can a film be when at least half the budget was spent on moving a huge bed frame around for interior and exterior shots br br definitely a must see for horror aficionados but suitable for the general audiences under the right conditions if you know what i mean and i think that you do it only earns four stars because i can't actually say that it took any talent to make
<START> lonesome dove is my favorite western second only to the searchers with john wayne i watch lonesome dove about every 6 months and never get tired of it i have read all the ld books although i cannot remember much of comanche moon i too looked forward to this mini series and decided to tape it on our dvr so we could fast forward through commercials unfortunately i messed up and didn't record the first part but decided to watch the other parts and try to pick up br br there is nobody that can ever compete with robert duvall or tommy lee jones and i was expecting to be disappointed and i was br br although there were so many things that didn't ring true the most apparent to me was when nellie died the day before and gus was out on the range it switched over to clara writing him a letter from nebraska telling him how sorry she was to hear of her death how in the world could she have known the next day way out in nebraska additionally it was supposed to be 7 years later after her leaving and her children looked to be about 6 7 years old maybe a little younger yet more time went on before they actually moved to lonesome dove and in lonesome dove they had been there about 10 years or longer before leaving to montana when they stopped at clara's in nebraska which probably took another 6 months on the trail the girls looked to be about 10 13 since they were playing in the yard like little children the math just does not add up br br i agree that the man who played gus had a lot of his mannerisms and looked a little like gus may have looked as a young man br br i am also a little confused about one thing the captive white girl that they brought back was she the one they captured when they raided austin they said she had been captured 25 years ago but if she was the one captured in austin it was only 7 years later when this took place in the movie was she captured earlier i remember seeing a captive girl after they raided the town and don't know if this is the same one if someone can explain since i missed part 1 if it had been 25 years she would probably be over 40 years old when they found her since she looked to be grown lying on the ground also the way they were ravaging her when they captured her it is hard to believe she would have lived to go on to be married and having indian children br br i have to admit though nothing is worse than john voight playing call in the sequel to lonesome dove or the unbelievable marriage of to pea eye in the sequel to lonesome dove which was never explained either also the way he killed newt off was i hear from spite for them doing the sequel with john voight without his approval br br if anyone can clear up these discrepancies i would appreciate
<START> i'm sick and tired of people complaining that never say never again is just a weak remake of thunderball yes that movie's influence is unmistakable but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re made films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the 1998 re make of psycho while it's true that the opening theme of the twelfth and connery's last bond film is one of the worst of the entire series the film itself still manages to stand on its own despite many other weaknesses besides that even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film br br sure sean connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed at least by james bond standards but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers james bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment having spent most of recent time teaching not doing and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from m that he pay more attention to his health dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot besides this is james bond remember this guy is supposed to be some kind of super human and all of his fans are getting all upset because he's got some gray hairs when this guy retires at the end of the film m sends poor small in a hilarious cameo from rowan atkinson to tell bond that without him he worries about the safety of the free world and all of you people can't get over the fact that he's not a sprightly young man anymore come on sean connery could still play james bond just as good as he ever could or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to br br the majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage as dr evil would say oh hell let's just do what we always so there's clearly not much new there but this is one of the bond films that had the better one liners there's the amusing scene where bond is asked for a urine sample Â if you could just fill this beaker for from here ' there are a lot of good one liners but the sexual innuendos aimed at mr bond are especially prevalent in this installment but then later he happens to throw that very urine sample into a villain's face making him scream as if his face were burning off not a very good attempt at comic relief especially since this guy had been kicking bond's ass with some sort of super spring device that could cut through pretty much anything and of course kim basinger stars in this film as one of the best bond girls of the entire series br br it's no secret that never say never again has dated badly and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects Â with the one exception of the flying missiles which were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982 the colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie second only to those damn sharks evidently blush put some sort of device on his scuba tank that attracted sharks granted they did have weird guiding mechanisms of their own in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line i have one simple request and that is to have sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads ' and then of course there is the exploding hotel room scene which was redone in an episode of the simpsons and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one liner from james br br the domination video game created by largo the film's villain is an especially memorable scene and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series far to superior to the laughable one in tomorrow never dies but despite many strengths the film's weaknesses are left clearer in the audience's mind at the end of the film due in large part to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion one of the more obvious parts borrowed from thunderball and recreated never mind the fact that largo revealed some crucial information to bond as he left him in the tower alive dr brilliance once again i'll just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan what ' the climax of what is expected to be a fast paced action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere br br all in all never say never again ranks very highly on the james bond scale and connery's wink at the end of the film as well as the two closing lines suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as bond clearly this is no longer very likely so we can only hope
<START> hayao miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe and his most recent cinematic work of art is a children's fairytale borrowing on story elements from the little mermaid of course like other miyazaki classics such as spirited away and his last film howl's moving castle is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults but this it is distinctly more a children's story than those recent efforts it's a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable aiming for charm instead of conflict br br is the story of a bug eyed childish looking fish of the same name the daughter of an undersea sorcerer who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl when she does she quickly befriends a young boy named in the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea and a giant storm drowns most of the cliff top town where lives with his mother and it threatens to end the world br br like howl's moving castle walt disney picked up for an american release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of western voices even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of disney band the jonas brothers frankie jonas and miley cyrus younger sister noah to voice and respectively also voicing characters are liam neeson fujimoto father tina fey lisa mother matt damon father cate blanchett sea goddess mother and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by betty white cloris leachman and lily tomlin the effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to american audiences and disney is getting close br br but voices are of little significance in a miyazaki film which is all about visual creativity a fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater must've been a joy for miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story among the highlights are of water that fujimoto sends after that move like living waves as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make as as any other miyazaki film br br as a children's story however concentrates its efforts on being adorable the discovery of true friendship and love between and is heart warming even if noah cyrus shouting childishly when excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying but as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are there's very little antagonism or danger past miyazaki films have clear villains but the conflict in actually shrinks as the story goes along believes he's lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea but is mostly tension free most glaringly its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters are br br will surely satisfy miyazaki's fans in every way with its imagination and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling but this is distinctly more of a children's movie best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience it's not quite what you'd expect from miyazaki considering his recent work but it's sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories steven c br br visit my site at http moviemusereviews blogspot com
<START> american tourist on package tour in asia suffering recent bereavement decides to break law by 1 ignoring curfew 2 joining revolutionary army 3 possessing and using illegal firearm etc etc what is meant to be a political and educational statement about the so called atrocities of a military dictatorship in asia ends up as a how to travel guide for disillusioned americans especially those who wish to protest that the water in the hotel does not work regrettably the authors of this silly yarn have no clue about asia nor it seems in writing sensible dialogue example our human rights heroine searching desperately for medicine in the furthest of the asian jungle miles from anywhere comes across a peasant and asks excuse me does this town have a pharmacy well those who know something about the asian jungle will appreciate how ludicrous that scenario really is mind you i was recently in the thai jungle and an american asked me excuse me do you know where is this movie is meant to be a serious drama but ends up as a parody and rip off of all those killing fields type of films designed to confirm tha asian stereotype held by much of western civilization and re by hollywood fantasies such as this the basic message of this picture is we americans coming from the worlds only true democracy have a divine right to go to all other nations and put right their wrongs screw up their environment and teach them about freedom see for example the beach at least leo did it with a bit more style of course vietnam is another story and the educated asian may well ask why the ho attitude about asia should come from a nation whose main contribution to humanity has been helping to spread cancer aids gun carrying kiddies and jerry springer et al at the end of this picture the cynical viewer may well be cheering for the burmese military 3 out of 10 br br
<START> ok i just flipped channels and caught i watched it knowing it would be trash but as a person who has seen tons of films this one stands up there as one of the most purely bad films i have ever seen i'm not kidding it is so bad you have to watch it like a bad accident you can't turn away from sometimes these kinds of films work ie troma movies but watching martin balsam and charles bronson slum it up like this is painful what's even funnier is i pulled up imdb to see what other people said and it actually scores a 4 1 10 i can't believe it made it past 1 5 equally as funny is this is not even the pinnacle of this series somehow this garbage warranted part 4 and 5 and to top it all off some dude's comments on here referenced this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time statements like that scare me about this world
<START> the movie is incredible it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie the lines in the movie are great such as nothings to good for out friends and its collection time charlie collection time i can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind i feel that when i watch this movie i want to go out and shoot down bad guys if there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one they killed the man they killed the they had no right in doing that hes on our turf ill take care of it the lines just keep on coming in the movie go out and not rent but buy this movie its worth the money trust me
<START> years before pre agreements became a regular thing ernest lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis eighth wife involves gary cooper as a multi millionaire living on the french riviera who's been married seven times and now marries claudette colbert for number eight but cooper's a good sport about it he always settles with his ex wives for a 50 000 00 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him sounds like what we now call a pre agreement br br of course claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage she'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it br br eighth wife has some really funny moments the original meeting of cooper and colbert in a men's store where cooper is insisting he wants only tops and colbert looking for only bottoms and of course my favorite is colbert trailing and blackmailing the detective cooper sends to spy on her herman bing has the best supporting role in the film as that flustered detective br br i've often wondered how back in the day hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are non french in a film like this of course cooper is an american and colbert of the cast is the only one actually of french background though david niven is charming as always having him be a frenchman is ludicrous he is sooooooo british br br nevertheless eighth wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called 'the lubitsch touch' back in the day
