<START> i suspect this board will soon be full of comments from over emotional people praising dear john as a pearl and a rollercoaster ride and all the other vacuous words this film's target audience typically employs br br i am most definitely not this film's target audience but i do not dislike romantic dramas either as long as they are well made so here is my objective take on the flick br br it is not good br br it's not a bad movie either but the plot meanders development stagnates where it should've been moving forward right around the middle to be precise and as for the ending it almost felt as if they had run out of ideas so they suddenly said hey let's just film a last scene real quick put some sentimental string soundtrack over it and end it that way even amanda beauty could not save this channing tatum too gave a good performance but you can only do so much with a flawed script br br speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy from the smokey voiced irritatingly high pitched female folk singer schtick surely chosen to appeal to the majority of college age girls that will go see this movie to the overused shimmering strings and piano combo it only annoys anyone paying more attention to the film as a whole rather than to his own feelings the film has a good beginning and the major conflict that launches us into the second act were all promising so was part of the second act itself as the story unfolded then the film just dropped the ball beyond that i'd have to give spoilers br br dear john is not a bad movie but it doesn't work as it should either if you want to see a truly moving film about prolonged love waiting to be reunited go watch notebook which was truly superb
<START> the concept is excellent the execution typifies the overall quality of the abc network br br apart from peter jones it appears that the rest of the panel consist of marketing execs rather than real br br when i realised that peter jones was getting together with simon my initial thoughts were wow he's gonna take america by the balls but it appears that abc have come along and destroyed the concept br br i was an absolute addict of the dragons den in the u k and was interested to see that peter jones had manipulated the concept that originated in japan and developed his own show for the states the result is neither inspiring nor informative br br if you lack drama in your life you have a choice jerry springer or the american inventor to sum it up a struggling musician selling out to a media mogul br br idea get me and i'll produce a show worthy of the title
<START> my cousins and i have watched this movie ever since we were little i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories br br i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch it is an old movie but don't let that fool you this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other
<START> i suppose that in 1997 hollywood wasn't quite at the point of openly celebrating homosexuality so one might want to give some credit to those who put this movie together for having shown a little bit of courage one simply wishes that credit could be given them for having put together a really good movie and in my opinion in out doesn't qualify on that count it's the story of howard brackett kevin kline a small town high school english teacher who on the eve of his wedding is by a former student who happens to win an oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a period of self discovery as he comes to terms with being homosexual to me that was the first problem with this movie howard didn't really have to turn out to be gay the movie would have been funnier and perhaps even more thought provoking had brackett remained defiantly straight in spite of the stereotypically gay aspects to his life and the town's belief after the oscar speech that he was gay in fact i thought that identifying him as gay given the presence of those stereotypes might actually have been rather insulting to the gay community as well as to straight men who like poetry and believe in dressing neatly br br kline was decent enough in the role and largely carried the film aside from him most of the other cast members although fine actors were people not really noted for their success on the big screen folks like tom selleck and wilford brimley and bob newhart are good actors but not big movie stars i actually thought that the funniest if very small role in the movie was that of the super model sonya played by an actress named shalom harlow speaking of stereotypes i loved her oh so stereotypical model line i promised to do that photo shoot this afternoon i have to shower and vomit in the end what really turned me off about this movie was the ridiculous ending starting with the graduation ceremony and to be honest even if someone decided that the graduation was really necessary the movie should have ended there rather than proceeding on with the totally unnecessary nuptials at the end br br basically i got a few chuckles out of this but nothing more 3 10
<START> hey i'm a fan of so bad so good movies but there's nothing so bad so good about rise of the undead it's just so bad and that's it no redeeming cheese no unintentional humor nothing boring apocalyptic zombie the undead a few people with hardly any make up nonsense with lame special effects if you can call those effects dumb plot and annoying actors they also have the nerve to rip off and quote from other better movies resident evil dawn of the dead night of the comet and managed to put me to sleep on the side however it was rise of my eyelids once the end credits rolled though my advice save your money it's not even worth a rental unless you want to p ss off and or put some people to sleep then go ahead and give it a spin you've been warned
<START> having majored in western history when i was a student in college seeing the views on world war ii are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong world war ii was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history while the axis powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every german soldier was out to exterminate the jewish population not every japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze missions and not every italian soldier was a fascist most of these soldiers for the axis powers were normal people like you and i caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved br br the battle of stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over 1 500 000 casualties sustained over the course of the battle the film stalingrad follows a german platoon and its leader lieutenant von as they are reassigned to the eastern front to battle the soviets at stalingrad von acts as sort of the main character with two other men rollo and fritzi they all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in germany and poland br br the film follows the course of the battle the film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle we are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles including a firing squad sequence overall the battles are the earliest examples that i know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence much of the inspiration for saving private ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film br br the film does not aim to make the completely innocent of everything in the film several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to evil most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home the film makes it clear quite quickly that not all germans were responsible for what happened during the holocaust most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place the film makes it clear that the soldiers in the germany army was simply fighting for a cause they really didn't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in russia br br the film really shows how hellish war is especially world war ii the battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle as with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it it will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the eastern front faced not recommended for children br br 4 5 stars
<START> brought philip larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time and not just the ones that are measured by popularity it shows a stark portrayal of life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his era which is exactly how he would have wanted it such was his disdain for and it dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of philips observations of our relationship with our own mortality and lays it our in a way that seems to have missed even the great philosophers for anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life love and death this is a must
<START> i mistakenly thought that this neo noir effort from the buffalo niagara falls area might be something different unfortunately i was incorrect there are are many problems with the falls that really have nothing to do with it's low budget video production immediately one has to question why all the constant narration my feeling is that if you have a decent script the audience will follow along without having to be insulted with voice over storytelling the acting is very amateurish which is not unexpected but simply adds to the problems finally the entire thing is annoyingly shot like an mtv music video which i found to be totally unacceptable the narration bad acting and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided merk
<START> i've seen a few bad action movies in my days but this one's just plain awful i feel it's a waste of time to even write this but i'll make it short why this movie suck here are 10 reasons 1 very directed and cut 2 bad bad bad acting of the whole cast 3 silly dialogs and too many clichÃ©s 4 too many plot holes a lot of scenes don't add up 5 bad photographing and a lot of continuity issues 6 ridiculously bad performance by the lead female actress 7 unreliable action scenes and not too good either 8 even for a snipes movie he shows a big lack of acting materials 9 outrageous accents of all the cast 10 last but not least too many implausible facts such as a tournament of soccer in the u s cia needing to do background checks to get new information about their employees a mattress that is explosion proof and so on in essence it's a waste of time it's not funny not entertaining not even as a joke don t watch it seriously just don't
<START> terrific production and a good comedic performance by george clooney can't save curiously detached occasionally clumsy quasi comedy from joel and ethan coen depression era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process the film meanders along but never builds any momentum it does get a big boost from clooney's charismatic mugging and also from the art direction and t bone burnett's lively music otherwise the screenplay by the is seriously lacking in humor and interest supporting cameos by john goodman and holly hunter fail to add any lift and the second half of the movie slides precariously into self indulgence from
<START> i must say i'm an avid horror movie fan and currently i can't get enough of foreign horror since us horror really depends too much on gore br br this movie is fantastic this movie reminded me a lot of m night's sixth sense the way the film was directed was great the director took his time to set everything up it took about a good 40 mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie i thought the movie was just a drama this movie just builds up and the pay off isn't too much br br i've never done this before but this is the main reason i liked the movie i actually screamed out loud because one scene just startled the hell out of me which is kinda pathetic but for a film to do that it's great
<START> this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen everything about it is just bad br br synopsis different situation comes up each week for the parent to handle their kids br br i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season the script is bad very bad Â it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc 17 movie especially for the young boy character where all he does is pleasuring himself is that what one called family show humor the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period br br final word this show is a real torture this show provides an image of how irresponsible parent can be using power wrongly rather than understanding it is zillion times away from reality listen to kenny g would be a god sends compare to this watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show br br rating 0 10 grade z br br note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show
<START> i must not have seen the same movie as the one the comments refer to here first i think they should have serialized ghost story if they were going to film it at all the truncated version they come up with was awful i felt the performances were mannered and so much was left out of the story that the performances of such masters as astaire douglas houseman and fairbanks seemed hammy alice krige was superb as eva though craig wasson is a good actor but he was only adequate as the protagonist the decision to cast patricia neal and to her role was not a good one imagine what anne bancroft would have done with that character i blame the script which was poor the production values were dark and the pacing was slow a disappointing pedestrian effort br br the book is one of the five greatest suspense horror novels of the 20th century imho but the movie was disappointing although a great introduction for krige
<START> there's no use trying to describe in detail the convoluted overly melodramatic plot involving civil war bitterness a crooked town boss and other complications it's all bad br br stella stevens andrew bo svenson william smith tim thomerson and lee majors are all good actors that may not be big stars or big stars anymore but always made fun movies br br here they're all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department in fact most of the acting appears to be on the high school level too which might not be so bad if it weren't so pretentious br br the name of ed wood is invoked way too lightly these days i think in this case the comparison is warranted however i suspect that old ed would have made a more entertaining western than this
<START> this is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on tv for far far too long everything gets tired and the jokes start getting repeated over and over again ok from the start the first couple of series were quite good you had an entertainment manager simon being pursued by his deputy played by ruth a cleaning lady wanting to become a yellow coat an alcoholic child hating punch and judy man a bent jockey and a stand up comedian as said earlier it started well but went on way too long once simon left it went downhill fast you were getting dire story lines and a new entertainments manager who ruth again threw herself at when a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked unfortunately this went on so long every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times over if this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic as it is it will be largely remembered for the dreadful last few series
