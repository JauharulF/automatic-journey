<START> forever strong is a type of film we've seen many time before just in different types of genres however that being said i really thought it was a great film sean faris is showing the type of potential that usually lands actors into big time stardom apparently this film got a limited release as i wasn't even aware of it but i saw it in the video store and decided to take a chance with it after i remember enjoying sean's performance in never back down i ended up making a great decision i'm not a fan of rugby what so ever but the film really isn't fully about rugby it's about making a stand in you're life challenging yourself reaching your goals there is a whole lot more then the simple plot suggests at 1st we don't give a damn about what happens to rick he's mouthy full of himself and completely arrogant we feel he's completely sealed his fate as a trouble maker along the way we see the changes in his character he starts to hang around with better people he starts to better himself we learn how much negative impact his father has had in his life it's just a great swerve and the film did a great job of turning rick from cocky prick to a good hearted person br br the rugby action itself is not too bad at all unlike the stuff i played and saw in high school this was actually quite fun to watch and beautifully choreographed a great young cast combined with some veteran experience helped this film immensely it just did a fabulous job of avoiding in what could've been a run of the mill type of thing to a poignant and effective drama i also liked the conflicting contrast between the coach garry cole and rick sean faris it made for a very interesting storyline and i loved seeing him help out rick along the way it was emotional and heartwarming at the same time this is a real hidden gem that i'm truly glad i discovered it made me think about my life and a lot of times i need something like that br br the performances sean faris is outstanding as rick penning he reminded me an awful lot of a young tom cruise cocky yet very charismatic and talented it was a tough role to turn going from a mouthy teenager to a good hearted young man but sean pulled it off with pure perfection he clearly put his heart and soul into this film so big kudos to sean for putting so much effort into this great film gary cole is excellent as the preachy yet likable coach who wants to help out the kids i've always found him to be likable he always has a sort of presence he carries to his films neal mcdonough is fantastic as the selfish yet pressured father of rick for the majority of the movie the script leads you to believe he's nothing more then a selfish bitter man who wants rick to be exactly like him but in the end you start to see the real him come out i felt sorry for him a bit julie warner is a good character actress and she plays the good hearted yet clueless mother well penn is required to play a real jerk and boy does he ever do that well on numerous occasions i wanted to pop him one so i must say it's a great performance arielle kebbel is the love interest not much of a part she did ok nathan west plays a somewhat mysterious character he did quite well sean astin is billed as a major player for the film but he barely does anything he did good with what he had to do br br bottom line forever strong is a great feel good film it will definitely make you stop and think about how your life was much better then you thought don't let this one slip you by you won't regret it br br 8 1 2 10
<START> this movie plays out like an english version of an abc after school special with nudity it makes you wonder who the target audience was supposed to be it's not as though the writers were too preoccupied with selling a plausible plot either while it does possess a certain watchability virtual sexuality is fluffier than dandelion meringue it's a good movie to watch if you're snowed in the out and it's the only tape you've got
<START> a bad quentin tarantino rip off at least i hope that's what they were going for because at least then i could respect the director for admiring tarantino one scene a singing scene with rose is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director so besides his quinton inspiration and rose and her one good scene this film sucked some of the crappiest dialogue i have ever heard i'm willing to bet why doesn't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been tries to be funny never is tries to be dark and isn't tries to be stylish and is just bland who dishes out the money to make movies like this i'm hoping it was all the directors so no one else's money was wasted if not for the whole cast is awful and when is your best hmmm i gotta wonder
<START> i really liked this movie if other people want to give it an average around 5 0 10 that's their choice i would give it 10 10 sutherland's performance as a private eye is totally awesome the story is amazing human exciting intelligent the dialogue is good the story might not be perfect but anyway the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for that moreover the ending is incredibly cool and their the jig saw puzzle really comes back to together so anyway i liked it i also thought the female lead actress performed very well i'm not a big fan of detective movies but this one was really good also because it doesn't give a damn about conventions of the supernatural
<START> that is the promise of the trailer i saw and by which i rented hitch exactly a serious film viewer shall not expect much further from this title but surprisingly enough smith mendes james and managed to reach a theatrical performance which could be metaphorically summarised on their rap dance floor routine by the end of the film their characters formed an effective combo which may prompt more than a good laugh with this sunday afternoon dvd providing your date is not an exquisite french swedish directors of the 60's movie fan br br p s the techniques to score are all true especially the cocktail girl routine
<START> whenever an idea was successful during those golden days of the silent movies you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated although reworking is the term that is used of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us for success in the movies or tv always leads to a trend with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit movie or tv program br br to this last premise we strongly disagree for this is or plagiarism plain and simple br br this the last silent laurel hardy short surely must have been quite well received for angora love hal roach mgm 1929 was reworked on the roach lot not once but twice over the next three years we were treated to laughing gravy roach mgm 1931 in which the goat was replaced with a cute little puppy dog also the weather is transformed into the dead of winter in the middle of a blizzard they also made other line up changes with substituting landlord edgar kennedy with landlord charlie hall br br the second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 reeler the chimp roach mgm 1932 which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct circus to which stan and babe were former employees the circus paid off its employees with their assets and the boys received the chimpanzee as their final payday br br back to our original 'victim' today's subject angora love the short starts off simply enough the boys encounter the goat on the street and the nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house after stan feeds a doughnut to her the comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between l h and slow burn exponent edgar kennedy their landlord the impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night and as luck would have it their room is situated directly above the landlord's quarters br br in addition to the noise the bathing of the goat its odor and landlord edgar's suspicions about laurel hardy's having another person illegally in the room we were most amused by a little throw away gag which may well have been missed by the censors while admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight regardless of their sex br br its camera shot is made from inside the boy's room over their shoulder with edgar in the hall and facing them he warns remember this is a respectable establishment just as he says this a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the landlord followed by a uniformed sailor who cocks his hat forward as they pass poodle schnitz
<START> this movie is at times a wild 80s college sex comedy others a sweet romantic one then it has moments of serious drama and then sprinkles in dashes of science fiction it is so uneven its almost ridiculous br br but i would hardly rank it as one of the worst films i've ever seen except of course for the fact that they casted peter o'toole br br there is absolutely nothing for him to work with here poor dialog poor performances to work off of poor everything and yet he's fantastic there is not one good thing about his part and yet he makes it work if only on pure charm alone br br the fact that he was so able to achieve so much with so little shines a spotlight on how greatly everyone else in this film failed making it seem even worse than i suppose it actually is br br if any other actor was in o'toole's role i would have forgotten this movie as crap and never thought of it again but a fine performance by peter o'toole despite all odds ensures that i'll remember this film for a long time to come if only as a film that maybe could have been good if anyone involved in it was nearly half as good as peter o'toole
<START> by 1971 it was becoming more and more obvious that hammer film studios were on the way out hands of the ripper is a case in point where even the idea smacks of desperation the spirit of jack the ripper posses his own daughter yeah okay no one was expecting a documentary but this plot seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for stupid premise and you do find yourself questioning why on earth the producers brought jack the ripper into the story was this to give the movie a snappy title br br the production values are unimpressive and the cinematography gives the whole movie a cheap tvm feel but you know you're not going to be watching a classic hammer horror as soon as the title starts because the music is laughably inappropriate i think the composer was trying to make the theme tune haunting and touching but the music resembles something out of a soppy romantic movie i will give the cast some credit as they do take their roles seriously in what's a far from serious movie br br i didn't enjoy this film much and it instantly reminded me of the phantom raspberry blower of london town from the two ronnies which i'd been laughing at in the weeks before i saw this
<START> true love i truly enjoyed and loved this movie it was fun funny and inspirational i just saw it on dvd how did i miss this one it's a winner i mean flex was that guy i wanted to marry him this was my 1st time seeing him as a straight leading man and he pulls it off i thought miller was the best ever and i was a felicity head too a fearless woman who only fears her nana thank you for giving women of color range in your work and she looks great tasha smith was a blast wright was priceless as nana this cute romantic comedy is a must see oh and the new comer marcus patrick is worth the surprise ladies true love karen
<START> camp blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film we're mixing friday the 13th with the blair witch project and adding a killer in a clown mask br br the budget for this film must have been very low some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the colourised version of the original night of the living dead which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poor br br this film was just so bad there is nothing in the film even worth watching the very fact i watched this all the way through stunned me just take my advice and don't buy or rent this film it is appalling

<START> this movie fully deserves to be one of the top hindi comedies ever made rajkumar santoshi is mostly known for his gritty hard hitting social dramas but this is easily the most effortless movie he has made br br the plot revolves around two small town buffoons amar aamir khan and prem salman khan they want to get rich quick and so move to the big city they hatch the same plan separately to woo a rich heiress raveena raveena tandon who is the daughter of a rich businessman ramgopal paresh rawal thus the one who marries raveena gets his hands on all her wealth but when they get to know each other's plan there is an intense tussle of one over who marries raveena hilarious gags and situations ensue as the battle rages on br br at the same time ramgopal identical twin brother wants to eliminate his brother and niece and usurp the family fortune add to this an assortment of funny characters including a maid karishma karishma kapoor a mistake prone butler named robert a manager named khan who mimics villain and a funny gangster gogo shakti kapoor who looks more like a pirate and a rollicking comedy awaits you br br do not waste your time looking for logic in the movie leave the company of your brains and just enjoy the actors are so much in sync with the script that no room is left for mistakes dialogues rajkumar santoshi dilip are witty music tushar and lyrics are memorable the picturization and choreography khan of yeh raat aur yeh ae lo ji sanam and dil hai tere is fitting and will remain etched in my mind forever br br the film starred two superstars in the making aamir khan and salman khan they eventually became superstars aamir khan is impeccable in his first all out comedy role i salute his sense of comic timing salman pales in comparison with aamir but is still likable among the supporting characters paresh rawal stands out in his dual role of ramgopal and br br the movie surprisingly failed at the box office i fail to understand why i recommend it to all nevertheless
<START> why would i say that because when the movie ended i was in a good mood so many people exclaim at the end wow bruce willis can be funny for those of you who believe he learned how to act after the sixth sense you must be very new to his career he won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did die hard it's like saying wow the sky learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life the movie was hilarious what boggles my mind is how some other comments made about this movie claims that there are no memorable lines or scenes spoiler br br the i am not a loser have you ever seen a grown up scream i am not a loser before br br i thought this movie was great it was funny it was never boring and in a cheesy disney sort of way it had a point to make something to do with life and of course any kid movie trying to do that is in over it's head but for once i didn't care br br if you haven't watched it do so you'll like it
<START> this film makes clooney all his films combined before this have all been based on the same character this film he transcends his previous body of work and proves his capability as a top notch actor the soundtrack defeats most one handedly the brothers have truly made a classic one to own and watch repeatedly
<START> i have never seen this movie on its own but like many others who have already commented i saw it as an episode of mst3k really terrible 70s television schlock but someone saw its potential because it's just been turned into a 125 million flop called the island br br and to the person who asked whether there were any good movies made in the 70s i want to remind her that it was a golden age for american film with directors like robert altman and martin scorcese first coming into their own not to mention little things like star wars 1977 just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far
