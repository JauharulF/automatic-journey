<START> picking this up along with the rest of the marx brothers box set i found myself disappointed by most everything beyond a night at the opera this stinker is prolly the worst i've seen of them so far with the clever lines left out and the characterization is woeful the playwright is so obscenely stupid in this play it's hard not to tackle the television and try and strangle him br br as it is the seem to do better as outsiders brought in to wreak havoc and are much much better when they have a good gag or two at least the material here is all obviously written for anyone and it really wastes the marx's talent avoid br br rating 3 10
<START> a total and absolute waste of time bad acting bad story predictable simple pathetic after a while i was only watching to see what happens since i'd already invested my time into it totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this honestly just don't bother a total and absolute waste of time bad acting bad story predictable simple pathetic after a while i was only watching to see what happens since i'd already invested my time into it totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this honestly just don't bother a total and absolute waste of time bad acting bad story predictable simple pathetic after a while i was only watching to see what happens since i'd already invested my time into it totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this honestly just don't bother
<START> i am a huge shirley temple fan when i saw this movie it made me appreciate what a talented child shirley actually was ashley rose orr made possibly the worst on screen shirley imagine an 11 year old playing shirley temple from the age of 5 that in itself is wrong but getting her to shirley's voice and her singing is woeful the dancing was good i'll say that as previous users have said there was little dramatic scenes nothing to make the story interesting not even amelia earhart i would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that shirley temple created there was too much focus on the wizard of oz when in reality shirley was just considered for dorothy the film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role shirley herself said that she is glad judy garland got to play her for me the star of the show was the lady who played gertrude temple otherwise stay away for great shirley temple films watch heidi poor little rich girl and little miss broadway
<START> i agree that this film was spectacular the way in which jamie foxx captured not only the impression of ray charles but the essence of ray charles really made the film his life made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told i also found a great interview with jamie foxx about this role by ernie from on houston channel 8 the link is http video google com q jamie foxx en i encourage everyone to check it out as it gives in depth looks into what went into his role and his personal feelings about ray charles the only problem i might cite with the film is that the style was rather bland at times but in the end i think it helped make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person ray charles rather than the film ray
<START> i found this one to be more chaotic than the average stooges short as strange as that may sound there were several funny bits especially the running gags calling dr howard dr fine dr howard the glass door breaking the stooges running into the supply room and coming back out with well you know but also quite of bit of it was taken up with things that just didn't make any sense to me i have to assume that these were generally take offs of scenes from the film men in white but since i don't know much about that movie i can't say for sure maybe if someone could explain these i'd appreciate this short more
<START> good grief 1 you completely missed the point the girl was only seen briefly specifically because she was the one who was going to kill herself everyone else was so wrapped up in their own stories they didn't notice her nor did we as one of the other students says at the end we're all so wrapped up in our own problems we don't notice what's going on for someone else br br the director himself said if he had killed off one of the others it would've suggested their problems were worse than someone else's the whole point of killing kelly was that she was unnoticed by all of us get it now
<START> this is a must see movie you will laugh you will cry and when it's over you'll wish there were more well written and compelling this movie draws you in and holds on tight the casting was perfect the characters purposeful and the performances outstanding nanny is the standard to which all women should hold themselves strong forgiving protective and never judgmental nanny to me is the epitome of what a christian mother and woman should be a true pillar of the community if i were half the woman nanny is i might consider myself to be doing okay i would have been devastated if nanny had died at some point in the movie but since she didn't i will definitely buy this when it comes out on dvd i can only hope that the story continues and that ruben goes back to lackawanna to try to rebuild the town piece by piece and person by person
<START> i was 10 or eleven years old when this movie came out and it has stayed with me for 35 years since when the movie came out all of the theaters in the st louis area distributed as a a pack of flower seeds that had the movie name etc on the front on the back of the pack it read in so many words plant these seeds at midnight if a white flower grows you are saved but if a red flower grows you are doomed suffice it to say that for an eleven year old kid i did not plant the seeds for fear of what may pop up here is the spoiler as the movie starts out you see a small toy tank moving about in the dirt on a small road a family is leaving town and suddenly the camera turns to the tank again and it is full size it rolls over the car and you see bloody limbs protruding from the wreckage then just as sudden the tank is small again br br the reason this movie stuck with me for that long was because i had a exact toy tank as the one in the movie unfortunately i don't know what happened to it but i did keep a wary eye on that thing ever since br br turn out the lights put in the dvd make a sandwich and watch this movie it is very good
<START> half past dead was unlike any steven segal film i've ever seen very little of segal himself in action and i agree with the last review i read peeples steals the show br br i saw nothing really new here just the same old stuff from other flicks changed around a little the best action scenes were as she once again kicked butt it was interesting seeing her as the bad guy after watching her for two seasons on walker texas ranger still kicking butt but for the good guys br br
<START> oh dear gods this is awful stay away just stay away if you think you've seen bad movies think again never before has my brain hurt as much as it did after i watched this movie the acting if it is allowed to be called that is enough to cause internal inside your head the story is so thin it is just barely there no wait scratch that there is not a complete story there but once in a while there is a few thin lines that stick up from all the amount of horribleness and believe me those few lines should have been shot the best way to enjoy this movie is to drop napalm on it and watch the cozy fire from a distance br br some may call me sarcastic in this review but i am only trying to spare some of you of a serious headache however should you be what i like to call a visual masochist like myself please go right ahead and watch this monstrosity
<START> please why not put this fantastic film on dvd i have been searching just like the previous writer for years whats the hold up or show it on tv its so underestimated its one of the most romantic and beautifully written books i have ever read and believe i have read some i seem to think it was read on radio 4 but i can't find that either why not try and remake it even i promise it will be top earner people love those sorts of stories so please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it although i doubt if it could be improved upon has any one read gone to earth by the same author or seen the film with jennifer jones this is superb but not to the same extent may be
<START> i have been away from istanbul for the last 10 years during that time i constantly lived in london when i have seen the movie i realised how much i am i am not just from turkey i am a part of turkey one of my part is istanbul the sound of the istanbul the people of the istanbul br br probably faith akin thought that he has done great musical documentary but i must say it is more than that it is about putting nice blend of vastly different musics cultures approaches politics into a delicious pot br br as we all know turkey to be precise istanbul is always comes and goes between being eastern or western city as one of the band member said istanbul is a bi cultural city but much more a eastern city because we always tried to be a western city it shows we've never been one br br this movie will catch from very first second music is excellent people are fascinating especially and singers band members it is nice to see you all at a small cinema in wood green
<START> so the koreans are now knocking off american horror flicks but they are doing so with style doll master is a close copy of puppetmaster and dolls and even has a little child's play going for it several young adults are invited to attend a special event at a gallery filled with dolls only to find they are targets of a vengeful spirit the dolls come to life and do some pretty nasty things to the kids the gore level is reasonably high the photography and set design and production values are first rate the acting isn't all that bad and the scares are definitely there doll master may not be in the same league with a tale of two sisters or even dead friend but it's close give it a watch you won't be disappointed
<START> i can't figure out what jon voight could possibly have been thinking when he got involved in this tenth rate incoherent pretentious mind numbing slop he helped to write the alleged script himself and he should be damn well ashamed of it the film i can't call it a movie because it barely moves at all is rambling embarrassingly pretentious drivel sort of like a really bad oprah winfrey show but worse it meanders senselessly back and forth from medieval times to modern day los angeles with voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother and somehow this gets transferred to modern times where voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company executive if the bizarre casting wilfrid brimley frankie valli kaye ballard and armand assante among others isn't enough to kill it the stupefyingly inept direction the washed out photography it looks like it was shot with a really cheap 16mm camera the almost complete lack of editing scenes either go on and on endlessly or are chopped off in the middle of a sentence and voight's embarrassing apparently stream of consciousness acting are enough to bury it which is exactly what should have been done with it a jaw dropping experience avoid this dog at all costs
<START> jimmy stewart was a real life pilot wwii flier and a one star general in the air force and therefore a natural for how real pilots react when they fly when you see the faithful recreation of the actual plane you begin to understand the real life bravery and courage of lucky lindy when he flew the atlantic solo in 1927
