<START> the museum of the moving image here in new york recently put on a comprehensive retrospective of jacques rivette's films having fallen in love with his paris nous i decided this was not to be missed br br largely through extended shots and structured scenes the movie depicts two avant garde theater companies preparing their renditions of seven against and prometheus additionally we are shown the directionless day to day lives of two individuals connected to the companies a working class woman named who finds creative ways of hustling men out of their money and a young man named colin who visits local cafÃ©s posing as a deaf mute and plays shrill harmonica at the patrons until they pay him to go away the first four hours or so are devoted to establishing the characters and their patterns before a somewhat loose whimsical plot finally emerges involving a conspiracy and the decoding of clandestine secret letters br br the film is largely about life on the fringe of society the theater companies are a despairing affair using their elaborate emotionally draining exercises which are really something to watch to distract themselves from the fact that their acts are unlikely ever to be staged or even seen colin and both have very few friends who only briefly find any excitement or purpose after the conspiracy touches them as they are spurred to find out more about it the film meditates on the consequences of rejecting normal society in several memorable sequences including a long shot of colin as he wanders the streets of france shouting poetry to himself as such the film has been referred to as an analysis of 1960's counterculture br br there is not a frame of the film that is not bursting with energy and vitality the fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous much more immediate the camera also becomes an important character in this regard throughout the movie boom shadows are visible here and there or other similar errors yet they seem natural and fit with the flow of the action because the camera is so important a player therein br br more than anything for me the film seems a great example of another way of making movies a venue for film outside the usual pattern for me it was a mind opening experience even more than paris nous though the latter bears many similarities of theme and structure a must see for anybody pondering the nature of art
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br david johnathon schaech and tish lori are a couple in budapest on business commitments and staying at a luxury hotel one night they meet an attractive woman at a nightclub and invite her back to their place where they end up in a threesome all is well until david receives some negatives in the mail and he and tish end up being blackmailed but when some people involved in the deception are found murdered things get messy and they are forced to enter the seedy underground world of pornography and hardcore bondage to track down the woman who may hold the key to everything br br whereas the original film dealt with the concept of snuff films this straight to dvd sequel deals with the more wholesome theme of threesomes and sleazy sex it plays like a porn film a cheap piece of titillation with plenty of hot t a action going on if this sounds like your idea of a good film you'll probably like it but you'd probably be more at home in a porn shop than a video store br br this tries to copy the original film's dark and voyeuristic feel but while it does a pretty good job of this it still can't hold up to that of the original's it has an apathetic story with a dodgy narrative flow and compared to cage schaech comes across as interminably wooden br br better than i thought it'd be i suppose and better than your average one of these dvd direct sequels that seem to be coming out a lot these days but really haven't we seen enough
<START> maybe the subject was good but put down to a script it fails in pace maybe the author was trying to obtain something slow paced like alien but instead of being haunting this movie turned out just boring technically good anyway a pity for the lack of tension
<START> when a saboteur blows up a controversial government research lab two experimental animals are loosed in a small community in washington state one is a dog with unusual intelligence the other is an outside experimental combat mammal or because of reasons divulged further into the film the hates the dog and so is trying to kill it watchers concerns the accidental involvement of travis cornell corey haim his mom nora barbara williams and his girlfriend tracey lala with the dog and as two national security organization agents johnson michael ironside and cliff blu track them down br br many comments are made about watchers being very different than the dean koontz book that serves as the launching pad for the film this is true but it should not affect your rating if you want the book read the book judge the film on its own merits not how closely it matches the book bill freed and damian lee who wrote the screenplay are just as much artists as koontz is that's not a quality comparison just a statement that they're all artists so is director jon hess their job as filmmakers isn't to slavishly follow the book as if it were a script they're adapting the book as artists to make a unique artwork it's based on the book not identical to it you have to loosen your preconceptions expectations when you watch the film because you're going to be experiencing an artwork that you are not already familiar with even if you've read novel br br so is watchers a good film it's pretty good not excellent good enough to earn a b or an 8 hess begins things on the right foot with one of the most beautifully filmed explosions i've seen in awhile unfortunately he trips a bit immediately afterward as we listen to some very thick exposition after that scene watchers threatens to become a clichÃ©d 1980s film as we first meet travis and tracey br br veering towards clichÃ© is a tendency continually threatened but it is only a skew more often than not hess is able to transcend well trodden territory with a number of interesting twists both travis and tracey are from single parent homes with their genders flipped both have unique mature relationships with their parents although this is a horror film a major focus is a cute intelligent canine and it often feels as much like an adventure film as it does horror a thriller or sci fi which are all genres it touches upon hess introduces a large cast of characters some not entering until late in the game yet the film is never confusing and no characters feel as if they are left in the dust all of the threads are nicely tied up in the end the structure is also complex in that there are two major villains the second becoming less obviously ill intentioned as the film progresses until a twist accompanied by brutal violence makes one antagonist clearer soon after hess gives us a nice moment of doubt with the other antagonist br br the biggest flaw in my eyes is a dreaded common one with horror films since at least the 1980s the attack scenes are shot too darkly too close too out of focus and they're edited too choppily it makes it extremely difficult to tell what's going on which saps most of the tension from scenes that should be a highlight surely part of motivation for the style and this is the typical justification for this problem was worry that the creature would come across as humorous and or fake rather than frightening and suspenseful in my view presenting the audience with a dizzying blur isn't a satisfactory solution we only get to see the creature costume makeup clearly towards the end of the film it was well done enough that better shot and edited attack scenes would have brought the film up to at least a 9 br br regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film watchers presents a gripping story using smart alluring characters it is frequently a nail biter and the horror scenes are more feral than you might expect if not exactly gory although there is a fair amount of blood in a couple scenes watchers tends to be underrated because of misconceptions about the role of film when it comes to adapting literature don't pass it up or summarily dismiss it based on a misconception
<START> this movie is beautiful in all ways it is visually stunning and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper the acting is superb it is subtle passionate and intense ben daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor there is not one flaw not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere it is completely perfect but only if you understand what you're going to experience it isn't a movie for anyone who wants normality
<START> eh heh eh heh hey dude look at these aliens they're like biting the humans and stuff eh heh eh heh eh heh br br this must rank amongst the worst movies of all time it's utter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain sure you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell outs are their reviews are too good to give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some b movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills br br but enough of that br br this movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being so bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at the old japanese 60's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked at least in those 60's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved upwards out of the back those movies made fun of how bad they were alien express aka dead rail seems to actually think of itself as a good movie which makes it incredibly absurd br br the effects were awful by today's standards beyond awful however not quite as bad as the 60's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal the plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as i've ever seen made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect i won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one it just wouldn't be fair to this pitiable plot plus it would take to long to even get started most of the acting was awful lou diamond phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one br br scifi channel is rapidly becoming the cheap thrills channel producing movie after movie without an iota of concept or intelligence in the lot i can only wonder why bother br br don't bother with this tripe it doesn't get any worse
<START> ok it's a piece of historical film making that caused an uproar shocked people and was banned i'll give it that which is why i gave it a 3 rather than a 1 it may have been ahead of the times but it's certainly way behind the times now i am a big fan of salvador dali and i loved un chien andalou that short was captivating with one creative scene after another l'age d'or was way too long and dull just a self indulgent piece of pompous film making created simply as a feeble attempt to try to out do un chien andalou by creating a full length movie and shamelessly leverage name and fame even though he had little to do with it total junk except for a very few shots of shocking scenes separated by long stretches of boring non action a waste of time and money both of my thumbs are down way down it'll go onto my shelf never to be watched again
<START> sarah plain and winters end was the best movie i have ever seen the person in the story that i liked best had to be cassie played by emily osment just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind for example when anna calls from town cassie wants to answer and she says hello anna guess what grand father was lost but hes back now and he is not a good man i loved all of the sarah plain and tall movies for my rating i think sarah plain and tall was 3 was 2 winters end was 1 if i could live in any family from the past it would have to be the family i think there are so many good parts in this movie i can't name all of them i think they picked the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past i would highly highly highly recommend sarah plain and winters end
<START> in a up and down career with all sorts of movies this is altman's one try at science fiction and it clearly shows that it's not his forte br br the film is practically incomprehensible it seems a disastrous combination of experimental theater pretentiousness and a major studio trying to jump on the post star wars bandwagon not that this film is at all modelled after that one but you can imagine that the studio signed on hoping for a much different paul newman sci fi film the story is nonexistent the characters remain strangers to us all the way through br br altman has packs of dogs feeding on dead bodies throughout the movie obviously straining to make some sort of point but since the movie is so poorly thought out starting with the lack of plot on up it really isn't about anything at all br br the production designed is confused the photography is undone by the blurs on the edges and the score is terrible however quintet does have one redeeming feature not only is the movie clearly filmed out in the snow and ice but the interiors are kept cold as well you see the actors' breath in every scene you really feel the cold
<START> if you are in search of a masochistic thrill rent this movie and show it to a group of your friends sober this movie is just plane lame but there not completely without value the brief tits are nice and there is one victim's death that is funny as hell other than that this is straight garbage but it is still better than grim or
<START> hmm is it right to compare tiffani thiessen and mark paul post saved by the bell acting of course it's not right it's ridiculous and is right to give this movie a 10' rating that's funny this movie wasn't so horrible though better than i expected it to be made for tv movies are often so so so similar so many of them have the same feel to them this one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b in the end story before it started i had envisioned ms thiessen as a vixen type 90210 seductress but here she was as innocent as kelly which was refreshing eric close surprised me by playing his part really well with some decent writing the director got a pretty good convincing performance out of him without being at all cheesy all in all it was somewhat interesting definitely better than most tv movies my grade b
<START> i've seen jimmy stewart in all the regular roles but the spirit of st louis was reported to be one of his favorites a poor box office performer when released this film has been largely forgotten today telling the well known story of lindberg's famous flight in 1927 stewart seems to be badly miss cast at first and his well known voice never lets you forget who you're watching it feels like george baily all over again but stewart obviously worked hard on the role and he does everything right so before long you don't care anymore that stewart was 20 years older than the man he's portraying stewart's lindberg is so gosh darn all american apple pie likable that you get caught up in the story and you realize that stewart intended to portray lindberg with all of the aw shucks yankee know how he could muster up lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the u s and stewart seems determined to keep up appearances br br flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is really a rather dull story moving along and i was struck by the subtle references to faith that were scattered through the film lindberg trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly only to be confronted by the priest on his beliefs or lindberg refusing to carry a proffered st christopher medal to save weight on the plane only to find the medal hidden in his lunch bag after he'd crossed the atlantic for me this is a film not about a man's epic journey into the unknown but his realization that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel
<START> peter coyote was the only name that i recognised from the cast list so i wasn't too keen on watching this film the only comment on imdb was positive so i watched it on late night t v i would recommend this movie as a good late night viewing it's better than a lot of this genre the plot is excellent the acting isn't brilliant but it's not bad i don't usually like flashbacks but in this film they work as i've stated i didn't recognise any of the cast by name but i recognised michele lee who gave a decent hard working performance as the woman wanting to stand by her man who is lying to her was it knots landing anyhow she's wearing really well note you may enjoy it more if you miss the first few seconds of the credits i did and it helped me when you see the end credits you'll get what i mean the wayne kennedy character who is really weird takes this to a 7 rather than a 6
<START> why does the poster artwork say clubbed is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time screen international when it was a quote of the french distributor reported by screen international an influential film trade publication see www com which reads br br pretty pictures has acquired all french speaking rights to neil thompson's clubbed james president of pretty pictures said clubbed is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time br br isn't this rather misleading the distributor is bound to say it's good are the other quotes real
<START> physical evidence is one of those films that you want to like but really should be a lot better than it actually is developed as a sequel to jagged edge for glenn close and robert loggia it gives the impression that all involved only made it while they were waiting for something better to come along the premise is perfectly serviceable it's mostly technically efficient if horribly uninspired with even henry mancini's score surprisingly pleasant but you can't help feeling that things would have turned out better if one of the leads had turned out to be the killer as is rumoured was originally the case as the opening scene of his little seen personally disastrous heat 1986 showed reynolds has all the makings of a great screen villain as is there are few surprises and a feeling of half hearted filming by numbers as it builds up a head of as it ambles towards a less than grand will this do finale br br reynolds is fine sailing through on charisma in what is clearly a star vehicle unfortunately the same cannot be said of theresa russell an impressive and fearless actress in husband nic roeg's films which allow her to delve into the darker side of human nature she's trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth and she ain't got it in spades she doesn't fluff her lines or bump into the other actors but that's about all that can be said in favour of her astonishingly stilted and often amateurish performance that lets the film down badly aside from ned beatty's prosecutor the supporting cast add only a slightly surreal presence in a boston where everyone seems to have a badly disguised canadian accent and the streets bear a startling resemblance to toronto and montreal br br likewise director michael crichton who in westworld coma and the first great train robbery showed that he knew how to lean an audience to the edge of their seats seems to handle the action in a purely perfunctory fashion indeed in one brief chase the shots don't even match and seem thrown together almost arbitrarily the climax itself has no flair and is completely bereft of threat or danger and many scenes are played for far less than they are worth it's no great surprise that aside from uncredited reshoots on the 13th warrior crichton hasn't directed since br br its watchable enough in an 80s tv movie sort of way even if it never lives up to the promise of its opening whether that's enough of a reason to see it is down to individual taste
