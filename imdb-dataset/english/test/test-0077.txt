<START> this movie is terrible it's about some no brain dude that inherits some company does carrot top have no shame br br
<START> is there any question that jeffrey combs is one of the true horror greats this movie seriously doesn't suck and is sort of funny watching a young combs at work is great but i wish he had had more lines look out for beyond re animator it's going to kick some
<START> i had this dvd to watch thinking that i would see a type of biography o painter goya but the movie was about everything but goya this movie is about a young woman taken away from her family by the holy inquisition allegedly because she practiced jewish rituals only because the poor girl did not like eating pork the rest of the movie is about torture humiliation driven by a poor script can't believe it is by jc carriÃ¨re as i could not believe this cr is directed by mr milos forman centered on a religious man and that young woman and that is all br br ah and there is goya i forgot playing a completely peripheral role that could be the role of john paul peter manuel joaquim jose or anyone very disappointing one one these movies that will be forgotten for ever if it has not had happened yet rent the name of the rose if you want a movie about the holy inquisition and i don't know what you should rent if you want to watch a movie about spanish painter goya maybe a director of a good caliber not forman still needs to make it ps the spanish painter goya the title role who is lost in the plot is portrayed by a scandinavian actor something that makes this film even more difficult to be taken seriously maybe next time we should send javier to play the biopic of norwegian painter munch
<START> i recommend that movie viewers if in the new york city area go to the intrepid museum and get some idea of how closed in and cramped the living was for the crews of world war ii vintage submarines how much more so that must have been for the seamen during world war i it must have truly been hell below br br walter huston and robert montgomery head the cast of hell below huston as the by the book captain and montgomery as his free wheeling number two they're both quite believable as naval officers and the rest of the cast like robert young eugene palette jimmy durante madge evans sterling holloway etc fill their roles quite nicely br br the silent service got more popular during world war ii and after it's amazing but i could name a whole slew of submarine pictures like torpedo run operation pacific of the navy run silent run deep and many more and you'll see the same plot situations in all of them i guess there truly is a limit on situations as well br br jimmy durante's performance is interesting he's pretty funny and his scene with the boxing kangaroo while on shore leave is very funny indeed but i'd have to say a character like him in those cramped quarters is probably very necessary for morale if you don't have someone like that to break the tension on board a submarine you ought to get one transferred to your ship immediately br br the highlight for me however is sterling death scene very similar to sean in island in the sky it will haunt you long after you've seen this film
<START> the hindi remake of mrs doubtfire starring and directed by kamal hassan is a somewhat shoddy version and not as good as expected br br kamal hassan clearly struggles with hindi dialogs even after all these years and cannot handle even one scene effortlessly the guy has aged and should give it a rest hassan doesn't bring anything new to the role or to the character as say dustin hoffman does to tootsie or marathi actor does to aunt's character in auntie comedy play br br what was the kid doing playing with firecrackers when it wasn't diwali most of romantic vs amrish paresh and then johny walker seem redundant to the main storyline tabu's bathing scene was unnecessary the family is north indian but must be reminded of karva night by a chachi yeah right br br the fine acting skills of not one but four actors namely tabu om puri the late amrish puri and paresh rawal have been wasted in this film br br watch the original mrs doubtfire clean crisp and crackling with fun quite unlike chachi 420
<START> mute witness is a modest yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves the film Â written and directed entirely by anthony waller Â is a tense action packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences no pointless mumbo jumbo or endless plot straight to the point mystery mute witness handles about the vicious topic of movies and is effectively set in russia spoilers since the production costs are cheaper there a us film crew temporarily moves to russia for shooting a horror film an old hangar is used as film location the female make up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff movie she's caught and tries to escape but since she's a mute she can't cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly the girl's life is in real danger now since there's a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they don't want the witnesses to be end spoilers mute witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end regarding the similar topic i'd say it's definitely better than the more famous 8 directed by joel schumacher and starring nicolas cage the acting in mute witness isn't great but the leading actress who's russian herself looks really cute sir alec guinness makes a special appearance too and a very cool one i may say surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares
<START> they loved him up and turned him into a horny toad god that gets to me every time br br this is a great movie memorable lines from thank god your momma died given birth seen ya died of shame to i don't understand big dan great scenes from the opening train scene laughed so hard i cried to the bluegrass br br watch it it's good it's great it's funny and it's based on a famous story worth your while believe me don't watch this if you have a weak bladder for you will definitely wet your pants laughing
<START> the basic plot is good and can be engaging the music is so great that it became the theme music for the tv show iron chef though it is way overused and too intrusive in the movie so how did this movie end up so poor well the plot was about 95 predictable and the characters were about as 1 dimensional as possible and the dialog what person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bull crap that purports to be dialog you get much greater realism from most cartoons the bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clichÃ©s and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome and this is a shame because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess if you don't believe me look at the number of goofs listed on imdb for this movie way in excess of what you'd expect to find they just didn't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems so as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re write and re editing
<START> this is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over the hill gang reminiscing in the diner that once thirty years previously was their hideout one ho hum duologue between two ageing rock a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence plus epilogue involving heist artist wannabe edward baer and current 'hot' property anna which has its moments no movie in which jean rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the over the hill quintet indeed the film is worth seeing for rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and it's definitely worth a look
<START> cartoon like special effects horrible acting and dialogue and dry plot this movie has it all my friend and i went to blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of but this was just too much the movie begins with a women and her son vacationing on a made up island in the region the women who just happens to be a doctor is in the area when a man collapses he has a strange wound on his arm and she immediately knows that it is a contagious virus the story goes on to show startlingly fast romance between the two teenage leads this is justified by the girl saying i know it's fast but it just feels nice anyway the entire island gets infected with this virus and the is brought in we are told that within three months if the virus is not treated and contained that it will spread to the united states and kill millions of people this information does not stop the from leaving the island to save themselves thankfully the cure to this horrible virus is found just in time and the entire island is saved to celebrate the death of there loved ones the island people have a smashing party where everyone is dancing having fun and forgetting about the horrible epidemic that just occurred
<START> this was a shockingly bad movie and i literally gasped the first time seeing the blue screen puppets imagine the worst blue screen special effects you ever saw make it somehow far worse and then combine this with poorly made rubber and play doh puppets that look like something from a semi retarded pre school art class then add some screeching esquire melodic metal guitar solos stuff that is way too loud and lasts way too long the overall film is absolutely awful and makes look like rashomon its one of the worst movies i've ever seen with every metric spiraling dismally downward much like a waterlogged turd in the perpetual slow whirlpool of a broken rest stop toilet still though a film like maximus is not to be missed by the bad movie out there even if only by looking up clips on youtube or someplace this movie is a bit of an eye opener if you can stomach the ride i think this director may be mentally ill though which is a bit watching him discuss the project you get the sense that he truly believes that he's created something wonderful i guess he's the star wars kid of gonzo filmmakers what a mess
<START> i just wanted to say that i was very disappointed after seeing this movie i was expecting a biblical story visualized with great special fx etc but during the film i found out that this was an absolute disaster it wasn't biblical at all only the boat and the animals were similar to the story if you want a visual of the bible version of noah then don't go watch this movie
<START> this is another bollywood remake of a hollywood movie hitch if i'm correct br br the film has some great moments which will have you laughing out loud which frankly only come from govinda who has become a legend within indian cinema and will always bring his a game in terms of comedies another bonus is rajpal yadav who is hilarious as the gangster who mimics an indian icon of cinema lara dutta is a plus i know i sound shallow but its mainly because i have a soft spot for her she tries to be funny but its seems to be forced her acting is weak but she still shines salman khan is atrocious he tries to bring the cool charming depths but fails miserably he over acts and keeps shouting for no apparent reason br br not acting mate thats called being mentally br br katrina kaif is just bad not very good at anything no charisma no talent and i don't see why people consider her pretty the plot was far fetched and i had a hard time believing that character was remotely attracted to govinda the only good thing is the music 'you're my love' was the best in the soundtrack
<START> the movie was pretty bad it's not so much a script problem it's just that the movie is really boring in terms of pacing the movie just seems to plod along at a slow agonizing rate the story in san is that there's a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt individuals maybe i read too much into it but hey it's my nature apparently after the san kills a pair of people under the golden gate bridge we're introduced to one of the main characters of the film joe estevez brother of martin sheen as a cop named bill culp bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer seriously he doesn't have a name he's just the killer and he is trying to coerce a local news reporter named rita to help him with his investigation bill is the stereotypical hard edged cop and he threatens rita to throw her in jail for obstruction of justice anyway a few scenes pass by and suddenly rita finds a letter left by the psychopath he's a cold blooded psychopath and she has a change of heart and tells bill and his partner joe about it and help them with the investigation br br the movie tries to be a taut murder thriller but sort of just fails at that it's much like the movie the black dahlia it tries to be tense but it just is unbelievable in terms of that the movie tries to be serious throughout but it has scenes like where the killer masturbates obviously a fan of gore porn what with lines like ooh blood on her or something to that effect and joe estevez hitting the table going he's a cold blooded murderer i admit to chuckling more than once at the movie even though i'm sure it was intended to be a deadly serious movie br br one of the only positive points the movie has going for it is the fact that i didn't pay money to see it huzzah netflix and it's sad because i could see some good in their movies after watching the damned sure the movie had its fair share of flaws but it was enjoyable sadly though san has nothing going for it granted it has an okay script it's nothing too grand but it could've been interesting instead what you get is a murder thriller that fails to thrill or have even vaguely enjoyable deaths also the other reviews claim that the movie has a great twist ending that's shocking apparently i was watching a different movie because by about the one hour mark i sort of figured out what was going to happen the ending didn't shock me in the least bit i would go on insulting this wreck of a movie but i don't think i will long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller i use that term loosely that fails to have the hitchcockian thrills that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending bland deaths acting with all of the emotion of a plank of wood and a decent soundtrack br br i'm sure others will try to defend this with the usual it was a low budget movie they did the best they could with such a low budget and all that other nonsense but when you get right down to it there was very little that they could've really spent that budget on there was very little special effects work the soundtrack sounds like it might've been recycled from hood of the living dead or the damned and it's the same damn crew from those two films this movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget flick that was no good and it was called mr jingles the two are about the same quality they fail to deliver anything close to enjoyment and should fade quickly into obscurity
<START> starring james belushi peter alex and jason lee underdog is a true hero's tale here is the story of a regular playful little when he is dog by a megalomaniac midget hell bent on destruction something freaky happens br br our quirky little neighborhood pooch gains extraordinary powers he can run as fast a cheetah fly as fast a superhero and has the power of thunder he is no longer he is underdog Â the best crime fighter in the animal kingdom the city cannot sleep until underdog it of the evil midget dr simon and his cronies br br if you fancy some really light hearted entertainment with all the clichÃ©s of superhero action flicks then this one is for you as for quality entertainment this one is strictly for the juniors those of you hoping to enjoy the comedy of the fast fading star james belushi a word of caution this is not one of his finer works
