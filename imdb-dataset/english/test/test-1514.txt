<START> i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to with the wind' should ever have been undertaken having expressed that i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film making the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe
<START> i somehow failed for a few years to see this film although it has been quite successful and generated a lot of discussions in israel i am sorry that i did not postpone indefinitely seeing it br br the theme of is a very real and painful one for those who know the jewish religious world the place of women in the orthodox family and society the basic situation that sits at the premises of the film is possible the problem is that the way it is brought to screen and the that the conflicts described receives in the movie is wrong gitai does not seem to have too much sympathy for men in the religious world but his approach of picking characters that are either fanatic or unable to express their human feeling makes the whole story seem simplistic neither does he a much better service to his women characters although here at least he shows more sympathy and he also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and gifted actresses in and overall gitai's vision is too one sided his cinema means are too basic he focuses on the technical details of the jewish religious life which may be interesting for people who do not know them but are really not relevant at all in the context of the whole story starting from interesting premises what we get here is a boring film which seems longer than it is with a very static way of acting obsessive use of music that plays in the same register not only from a musical but also from an emotional perspective and a very inconclusive if not even confusing ending what difference between this film and 'ha inspired from and describing the very same social landscape and which succeeded to transmit human feelings on the screen in there are both too little cinema and too little human emotions
<START> but it's still an entertaining tv movie the transposition to the civil war makes a nice change of pace and adds a few subtexts such as ariel's servitude to prosper prospero that you might not otherwise see thankfully they didn't try to make it a mini series at 90 minutes it's just about right
<START> this film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made in that it displays the reality of soldiers in a battle situation as well as the particular circumstances of the battle of stalingrad obvious when one compares this film to works such as anthony book stalingrad br br unlike the better known enemy at the gates where the plot diverts into a sniper hunting story this film shows what war can do to individuals although filmed by germans stalingrad is anything but a nationalistic apologetic film it shows that war films can be something beyond flag waving jingoistic distortions of the grim truth of war like so many hollywood war products seem to be br br the scripting acting direction and other film techniques in are of the highest caliber br br it's a must see film for anyone contemplating to join an army and to obey orders from any type of fuehrer
<START> danny glover and carey elwes obviously forgot how to act when they made this movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the pay off is even worse i feel sorry for danny glover i hope he got paid well for this because it makes him look completely foolish the same goes for mr elwes an absolute slap in the face to any horror movie fan despicable this is probably the worst display of acting by veteran actors i have ever seen i wonder if they bothered to look at the script or if they did it must have said forget everything you know about acting because this makes the two of them look ridiculous for two seasoned veterans to act this way is appalling i hope the pay check was very large i thought at first it was a spoof if you can find satisfaction in this movie then more power to you
<START> i was looking in the tv guide for movies that come from germany and i found one called the so i watched it and i laughed myself silly i wanted the dvd but its not available here i could order it from germany but it doesn't have subtitles it was played again so i taped it and watch it from time to time br br anyway i looked for info on it and found out its real name is stefan but i know it by its australian title the br br some people who i know from germany do not like stefan because of their accents but not being german myself i didn't notice anything the jokes are good but some germans might find their accents off putting br br i think this movie is funny and if the dvd had english subtitles on all the extras having a 2 disk edition with only the feature having subtitles would be bad i would buy it up in a snap br br i recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story
<START> stylish thought provoking cool and gripping Â just four aspects of a film that will long remain in the thoughts of this viewer br br slow paced it may be at the beginning but the director beguiles with beautiful camera work sophisticated compositions and elegant editing the unfolding of the story not so much the narrative line but the revelation of the characters' inner selves is masterful br br olivia magnani who plays sophia the hotel receptionist who finally breaks down the icy reserve of former di tony is coolly beautiful and reveals hidden depths and personal honesty in her brief but profound relationship with br br the disgraced mafia middle man forced to live out an empty life tormented by insomnia in a swiss hotel becomes caught up in the similarly empty lives of the refined older couple who formerly owned the hotel but are now forced to live there as residents after the husband gambled away their resources years earlier the husband is constantly dreaming about recovering his lost wealth and making a grand statement to the world his wife realises this is but a pipe dream this nicely counterpoints the resignation of who sees no way out and does not seek one br br the fleeting love affair between and sophia has consequences that no one could have foreseen it enables him to escape his prison without bars but to pay a huge price that he willingly accepts and in doing so provides redemption for the older couple
<START> this is one of the best musicals of the 1940s the glorious technicolor shows off rita hayworth's beauty and spectacular hair she should have made more movies in color but then columbia was hardly in a position to splash out money for technicolor spectaculars br br rita is a wow as rusty parker she more than keeps up with gene in some of the most sparkling numbers ever she also looked beautiful in turn of the century gowns so she was given a chance to play her own grandmother br br the film opens with the show must go on it looks great to me but danny mcguire gene kelly is not impressed his motto is work work work one of the dancers lesley is determined to better herself and is going to audition for golden wedding cover girl competition rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions as well in a very funny scene has just had a so so audition and seeing rusty gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges don't be shy and demure chatter and sparkle rusty does so with gusto br br they decide on and go to the show to see her but john otto kruger sees rusty she reminds him of someone from his past cornelia eve arden is still having nightmares over audition whose complaining features genius phil silvers and the dancers dressed up as working girls rusty is a cabbie br br john is remembering a long lost love grandmother hicks the first time he saw her singing a sure thing set at the races meanwhile danny rusty and genius are looking for pearls at their local diner they then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s in my opinion make way for tomorrow br br put me to the test is a spirited song and dance number featuring danny and rusty in the meantime rusty has been chosen cover girl and danny is the place to be seen lee bowman appears as danny's romantic rival and puts a damper on things lee bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever so danny never needs to worry br br rusty dubbed by martha mears sings long ago and far away and it is danced beautifully by danny and rusty the gowns that rita wears are stunning travis banton and gwen designed them danny wants the best for rusty but is afraid he will lose her gene kelly is also fantastic in the alter ego number where he dances with himself br br poor john is another look back to the turn of the century it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit look for al norman in both poor john and a sure thing he was an amazing eccentric dancer who appeared in several early musicals including king of jazz and paramount on parade he was easy to spot br br the cover girl dance is just wonderful rita was so talented beautiful and a great dancer after a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of america's top magazines rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy cover girl song gosh i just love this movie br br highly recommended
<START> it is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial wake up call and should they survive this event they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune however in the case of comedian's they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were prior to it such is the case with martin lawrence frankly i pay little attention to celebrities as i have much better things to do with my life than to spend it monitoring others' so i was unaware of the majority of what lawrence had gone through prior to this film it was interesting but unfortunately all to common i was left with the larger impression that this guy's stand up act just wasn't very funny save the big life messages for a book just be funny on stage if you want to see a funny martin lawrence go rent some of the old def jams for which he hosted don't rent
<START> just as the whole cast and crew knows f all about film making br br this film concerns the adventures and predicaments of a modern day cockney vampire assassin and an age old spat with her seemingly jaded vampire lover that plot in itself reeks of clichÃ©s and promises of boredom when on as small a scale a film as this and that's exactly what you get br br first off let me say that i by no means dismiss films because they are b movies in fact some of my favourite films are b movies such as jesus christ vampire hunter but this one misses the mark by a mile br br anyone with any knowledge of small budget films will know that the acting is rarely gripping and emotional but razor blade smile creates a whole new dimension of hamming it up on screen some of the so called acting is just indescribably bad with characters spewing cheesy one liners that fall flat and discourse expressing about as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a couple of horse br br a vast portion of the film is also taken up by the vampiric characters the protagonist in particular unnecessarily flapping their mouths showing off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly it literally must happen in almost every scene at least once and quickly became annoying and pointless as if that many looks of slack jawed supposedly scary vampire faces were used to merely fill a little bit of time and pad out the rest of this turd sandwich of a film br br contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe on here i feel this film the director in particular is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts the sheer number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme close ups seems to indicate to me that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate to its genre and not spoof it and he fails miserably the attempts at supposedly tasteful sex scenes come out as comic and silly and the action sequences are sometimes just plain stupid br br also the ending of this film was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions i have seen to a film b movie or not when films such as this force you to sit through hours of themselves only to be rewarded with a oh it was all a game ending it is actually sickening it the conclusion to the plot feels like an afterthought of the director that he figured out on the last day of shooting because they had run to the end of their shoestring budget br br but i have not rated this film as one star despite the overwhelming crappiness and this is because of the only plus point i can really give this film intentionally or not it was funny i am fairly sure the parts i found humorous were not intended to be and i found most of the efforts at genuine gags to be fruitless but when watched with friends it is a good film to take the mickey out of
<START> tom jackson is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene cleaner upper in his latest job he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and isn't aware the crime hasn't been officially reported uh oh this can't be good br br you hear about cleaners all the time but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area cleaned up this one is different in that tom works with the police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene hey someone has to do it you know the police won't the movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area cleaned up br br this is almost a good thriller but a side plot involving tom's daughter palmer makes this story somewhat awkward i guess they had to fill in some time oh they brought this side plot around to connect with the another side plot but it was still a reach and awkward see br br this was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension suspense and the pace was somewhat draggy the music didn't help either as i noticed the music was more appropriate for watching people take a long journey you know journey music get it ha br br the acting by all was excellent in this almost a good thriller br br violence yes sex no nudity no language no
<START> great little short film that aired a while ago on sbs here in aus get a copy if you can probably only good for a few viewings as you'll end up remembering the script and it's the twists that make this film so funny well directed and intriguingly scripted it's an example of just how good low budget short films can be
<START> my girlfriend and i are really into cheesy horror flicks especially ones with lots of unnecessary nudity when we saw the box cover for this movie at blockbuster we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night we began watching it already not expecting it to be great but thought it would at least catch our interest 20 minutes into the movie we realized that the pace would not eventually pick up and that it was an incredibly boring movie we tried to get into it but the plot made very little sense even after reading the back of the dvd box over and over again the film was shot very dark and it was pretty annoying to try to figure out what was going on in each shot each violent scenes were very hard to make out and you never get to actually watch the violence you're expecting this is definitely a film without motive that was shot poorly and very drawn out each scene was about 20 minute of the same thing and i felt i got the point after the first 5 skip this film and re watch another freddy or jason flick and you'll be way more content
<START> this is a cherished movie from my childhood i can still hum the theme song at the drop of a hat i remember getting to stay up late to watch this movie with my father usually two to three times a year we always referred to it as giant robot although the effects in this movie are crude compared to today's standards they were perfect for this movie's genre i am also a big fan of the japanese monster movies so this movie fell right in to place with the others it's been years since i've seen this movie would love to get my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8 year old daughter
<START> i cannot believe i let myself rent that piece of garbage the acting was so poor my grandmother could have done better the punches thrown in the movies were nowhere near the character the scarecrow was knocking to the floor the movie became a chore to watch br br so this group of baseball jocks decide to go hazing even after they weren't supposed to in orders form there coach under consequences so naturally they go anyway they decide to tie a loser to a post with the so called scarecrow when the loser's best friend finds out about this him and his girlfriend go to rescue him br br the kid is found out to have diabetes and is hospitalized while the jocks head out to the beach the next day the scarecrow finds them there and kills them all pretty much br br i'm sure you really don't care anyway the scarecrow ends up having a connection with diabetes boy and the boy starts to finish off the scarecrows job once the scarecrow is killed yes it is really really cheesy br br it thought this movie was full of bull sh t sooner or later the only ones living naturally are the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters the evil is then transfered to the boyfriend and he kills himself to break the curse so nobody else will be hurt touching hey no don't waste your hard earned money on this i give it a score of a one since thats lowest otherwise it doesn't even deserve that much
