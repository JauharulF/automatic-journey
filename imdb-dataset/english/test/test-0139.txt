<START> this is an adaptation of an edith wharton work whose writing is amazing sadly this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century repression and desperation work depicts ward and dalton aren't so bad but alicia wooden performance made me wince she was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story but she stood like a stick the whole movie long and i never believed a word out of her mouth when she asks ward why can't i move you near the end of the film i couldn't help but answer that's what i've been wondering for the last hour and a half
<START> in thailand the americans connor colin and his girlfriend amanda meredith monroe quarrel in a thai fight and amanda leaves connor alone she asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger indeed the mean vampire don hetrakul and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles connor joins to a clan of good vampires leaded by sang stephanie chao trying to save amanda from the claws of br br i expected that vampires the turning were a good movie the locations and the cinematography are beautiful the very heavy music score is excellent stephanie chao is gorgeous and attractive but unfortunately the screenplay and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of meredith monroe does not help her fallen breasts the story is very short and the unknown marty weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle race fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for film my vote is four br br title brazil vampiros a vampires the conversion
<START> have you ever read a book then seen the movie and wonder how did they screw it up so bad this is one of those the book by nobody likes a drunken indian was great riotously funny this movie is not it seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we cared about the characters this movie which touches on some real concerns about indians makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the holocaust or slavery not well done
<START> for some unknown reason 7 years ago i watched this movie with my mother and sister i don't think i've ever laughed as hard with them before this movie was sooooo bad how sequels were produced is beyond me its been awhile since i last saw this movie but the one impression that it has stuck with me over the years has been they must have found the script in a dumpster in the backlot of a cheap movie studio made into a movie and decided that it didn't suck enough and made it worse i'm pretty sure that they spent all the budget on camera work and the so called special effects and then had 13 cents left toward the script and to pay the actors
<START> as a lesbian i am sick and tired of being portrayed in movies and on tv as a sad person forever vacillating between suicide and homicide but never destined to find happiness br br if like me you are fed up with hollywood's anti lesbian propaganda you'll breathe a sigh of relief at this delightful offering from the bbc nan is the daughter of an oyster house restaurateur who wonders why she can't feel the way she should about freddy one of the local lads who has his eye set on her she falls Â and falls hard Â for kitty butler a male impersonator with a visiting theatre troupe nan accompanies kitty to london as her br br not everything that happens to nan is pleasant in this story and some of the things she does are not squeaky clean either but she will win your heart and her story of love triumphant will leave you with a beautiful lump in your throat at the end br br if you are a lesbo hating macho man or a homophobic housewife or some brand of religious fundamentalist who believes that homosexuals should die and go to hell this series is not for you but if you have a heart and you believe in love you will cry at the end as much as i did
<START> i loved flash gordon as a child and watching the series again on dvd brings back such fond memories each 15 minute episode features the adventures of our hero flash the lovely dale arden and intrepid dr on the planet with flash escaping death at every turn the shark men nearly drown him he faces the fire monster in the tunnel of terror and he's in mortal peril in the static room br br the characters are still fun buster crabbe is every bit the blonde dreamboat hero and jean rogers is a delicate and beautiful dale arden princess aura still plots to steal flash for herself king of the hawk men still has his booming laugh and angel wings and ming the merciless emperor of the universe is still giving everyone the evil eye and the creeps br br this serial probably wouldn't interest children today with its hokey effects oh that spaceship but it's a fun bit of nostalgia for those who liked it the first time around the actors play it straight and don't play down to kids i appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the chapter synopses which had pretty big words in them br br i'm glad this came out on dvd it's a lot of fun to revisit this classic sci fi serial
<START> first off i can remember vaguely being told this story in primary school about 6 or 7 years ago so i am sort of familiar with the story br br a lot of that has changed however and there are many differences and mistakes sometimes unnecessary in the film that die hard fans will not appreciate br br however as a whole i really love this film i first saw it near christmas about 2 years ago well the 1st part then caught the whole thing again last christmas probably on the same channel br br i was very impressed at times it may be a bit overdrawn and long but with an engaging story decent acting especially from frosty fonda and hobbs and beautiful scenery costume and little touches of magic make this a really special film which for me really reminds me of christmas br br despite differences from the book i think the film does well to incorporate new themes and ideas the seasons with autumn winter etc with i think a new thief character to represent autumn throughout the imagery once you notice is quite startling and brilliantly executed br br i live in the uk so have waited a long time for the dvd and luckily enough i saw an advert showing a series of free dvd's being offered in the daily mail newspaper which i don't normally get so i got yesterdays issue and finally have my dvd if you missed it and want this rare dvd for region 2 i suggest you collect the tokens from the daily mail and send them off as your dvd will then be delivered by christmas br br so for a bit of escape into the christmas season this year put on your fire get cosy and watch this as you and kids probably will really enjoy this great film if you don't have it it will probably be repeated on channel 4 this christmas so record it
<START> i wish i could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses but i can't another species could have come and mutated while i waited for some action for such a controversial man darwin lived the most conventional life if you didn't know about the mad theories you could almost mistake him for a stamp collector br br the film makers have cast darwin as a dullard which does him a disservice even when he briefly loses his mind due to his tireless it wasn't interesting to watch maybe great thinkers are dull people i don't know what i was expecting a forehead banging eccentric with wild hair and eyes espousing his love of all things simian the glint of madness straining from a furrowed brow a long haired hermit who to animals a head cradling lunatic with eyes lit up like of truth all of the above would have been great this is the movies for scorsese's sake br br but there was none of that no lightning no thunder no wonder no awe just paul bettany and jennifer connelly fresh from the subtle as breath school of method acting i imagine that someone with darwin's ideas had a brain like a speeding train so why did this film just along chug chug chug like a slow winter the disappointment is immeasurable
<START> i find it amazing that so many people probably poles have voted for this movie giving it such grades mostly tens ok the movie was fine funny but it was nothing special on the other hand the only good thing about is the dialogues rather not comprehensive for non poles screenplay is primitive the acting except for jerzy stuhr as awful it's too much ado about nothing fortunately it's not included in the top 250 p s the sequel 2 2 is on the way and it's just the same story
<START> this movie was much better than i expected jean peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fights to the extent she may have a double doing the action it's hard to tell but peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it and doing it well with a good and serious script this could have been an excellent film but it's basically cheesy still entertaining however not up to a regular jacques tournier film but definitely above a regular jean peters film color is typical of this '50s time period ie too garish and not realistic the actors for and her first mate and the drunken doctor were good louis jordan was a bit weak i don't think debra paget was right either but certainly jean peters and debra paget were probably the two best looking female stars in the '50s
<START> we'll never see this movie broadcast by hbo in the near future if at all if anyone somehow comes across it in a video store just grab it before someone else does because i doubt if it ever will be re released again br br an unbelievable and timely movie about the first attack on the world trade center on february 26 1993 and how the government agencies who's job it is to identify and stop terrorists from doing harm and damage to american citizens and american property completely fell down on the job and unwittingly allowed it to happen br br bone chilling since we all know now that the terrorists who were apprehended at the end of the movie weren't going to be the end of our nightmare that resurfaced on september 11 2001 br br the film brought out everything that went wrong back in 1992 93 that allowed that first tragedy at the wtc to happen still it took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from that first wtc attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and far more devastating assault on the world trade center to happen i found this movie harder to watch after the events of 9 11 then the video of the attacks of 9 11 themselves br br all i can say about this film is don't watch it alone the very ending itself is so powerful as well as prophetic that it would leave you in a state of shock in knowing what we know today and possibly in need to have someone who's with you but not watching the movie to call for medical attention
<START> starring kelsey grammar rob schneider lauren holly rip torn this movie is a classic family favorite at least for most members of my family that is one of us rolls our eyes at the mention of this movie and thinks what a stupid movie i'm not that person though i still find this movie highly amusing i just watched it again last night with someone who had never seen it and i laughed just as hard as the first time i watched it it's still very funny to me br br naval captain tom dodge grammar is a bit of a black sheep in the navy he's the kind of guy who will play golf while on a sub cracking a ball onto a golf course while they sail past it he's the kind of guy who will get drunk pass out and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his he's not the kind of guy that everybody wants to be commanding a sub br br but dodge is at the end of the line he's put in applications to get command of his own sub several times and if he doesn't get a sub this time he's headed for a desk job meaning that's it for naval life the admiralty decide to give him his own boat but they don't give him a new nuclear sub they give him a diesel sub an ancient relic from world war ii his mission is to clean her up and take her out on the atlantic for a war game br br dodge is obviously a little bit frustrated to have such a crappy boat given to him when he's worked so hard to get to the point that he's at so he goes and talks to admiral winslow torn about it winslow explains the purpose of the war game diesel subs are still being sold out there in the real world to countries like iran iraq and libya to name a few winslow wants to know what would happen if some renegade captain in a diesel sub came to the states and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases would they make it dodge and most of the admiralty don't think so but winslow wants to know for sure hence why he has devised this war game mission is to take the stingray out to sea then try to evade the u s nuclear navy and blow up the american naval bases in simulated battle of course br br so that's about as deep as the plot gets this is not a plot driven movie it's a stupid movie that is just a big gag it makes fun of itself and you are not expected to take it seriously if you're looking for good dumb laughs on a friday night i'd urge you to check it out br br bottom line 3 out of 4 worth a look
<START> secret service agent jay charles bronson has been assigned to protect the president wife the new first lady jill ireland she is a very difficult woman and has his hands full she is the victim of numerous assassination attempts all directed by the president's chief of staff who wants the first lady dead this movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line but also with the lack of realistic locations for example in the scene depicting the inaugural parade the first lady is in a rolls royce convertible with agent and without the president also we know what washington dc is like weather wise in january and not only is everybody top coat less you can even see some palm trees in the 70 degree and sunny weather obviously filmed in hollywood not washington dc this movie is a joke it is not worth your time
<START> i guess if they are not brother this film will became very common how long were they can keep this if we were part what should they do so natural feelings so plain and barren words but i almost cried last night blood relationship brotherhood love knot film in another word the elder brother is very cute if they are not brothers they won't have so many forbidden the hearts of their own at the very beginning the elder brother is doubtful of whether he is coming out or not at the beginning maybe the little brother being so long time with his brother and even can't got any praise from his made him very upset and even sad maybe this is a key blasting fuse let him feel there were no one in the world loving him except his beloved brother and i want to say this is a so human natural feeling there is nothing to be shamed you may fell in love your just a frail heart looking for backbone to rely on
<START> i just want to say that i was thrilled to find these comments about the show i have tried online searches for info about the show in the past with no luck i loved the show i have a hard time getting motivated to exercise but this show made it fun as another comment mentioned that it wasn't so complicated as the routines nowadays it was an ideal workout that got the job done i would give anything to be able to buy a copy of just one workout i remember many of the moves but not nearly all of it somebody please try to get it back on the air and also make it available on dvd it is so great to know i wasn't the only one that loved that show thanks for making my day
