<START> okay i'll admit that if i didn't have kids i never would have seen this film and would never see it but considering all the rotten kids movies i have seen such as spy kids 2 or babe pig in the city this is a significant improvement and it had enough in it that i wasn't totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide something i did repeatedly in the other two movies sure the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly but it is a kids film and compared with other films in the genre this is definitely better than average frankie and amanda actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty at least on infomercials or doing voice overs br br so if you are looking for a film to see with your kids you certainly could do a lot worse
<START> you know those movies that are so unspeakably bad that you have to laugh half caste wasn't one of them which sounds good right but no it's not it's not a bad attempt at a horror movie that's fun to watch because it's lame or not well acted or has bad special effects or anything else like that no half caste is just plain boring they don't even make an attempt to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so it's just kids running around in the african bush country and getting high off of elephant dung for the first 75 of the movie and it's not even funny the last 20 minutes though are hilarious i have no idea what happened but it was really fun to watch that cgi leopard rip out the throats of all of those white guys i couldn't tell apart anyway if you're in the mood for a bad horror movie don't rent this one because you'll go to sleep before they get to the fun stuff if you do accidentally rent this movie i'd recommend fast forwarding to the end and skipping any scene that happens in daylight you won't miss anything you won't have any idea which character is which or exactly what is going on even if you do watch all of the back story
<START> no lifeforce is not a great movie br br it's not a good movie br br it is however an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline and of course mathilda may it may actually be one of my favorite sf horror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to reason their way through the science of the space vampires how often do you see that not even in alien the sf horror flick of all time does science come into the story at all in lifeforce they are trying to make reason of an unreasonable world br br now do i think it's successful no i think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that hooper is straining to keep collected and on track and that the viewers have to focus on more than one 'villian' and there are one too many road trips br br to be honest the movie is eye candy and fun to watch but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take a hold of what hooper was trying to do and really create a strong scary sf horror movie br br if the remake does happen however i demand that mathilda may have a cameo
<START> this is a cute little french silent comedy about a man who bets another that he can't stay in this castle for one hour due to its being haunted and once the guy enters the house it looks much more like a crazed fun house or maybe like the after effects of lsd while there are ghosts and skeletons there is a weird menagerie of animals odd special effects and gags as well it's awfully hard to describe but the visuals alone make the film worth seeing however understand that the self indulgent director also had many funny gags that totally fell flat and hurt the movie his camera tricks weren't so much tricky but annoying and stupid ignore these and keep watching it does get better the film is fast paced funny and worth seeing in particular i really liked watching the acting and mugging of max linder he was so expressive and funny too bad he is virtually forgotten today for an interesting but very sad read check out the imdb biography on him
<START> jeff leroy wanted to makes fun of scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it the twist is that instead of frail old l ron hubbard as the cult leader there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult his landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult it doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing his blood the screaming was shot very cheaply on video and i just plain ugly the space monster which looks like a giant winged cat that looks perpetually mad and has no skin is alternately a clay miniature and a large scale animatronics puppet both of which look awful the acting and writing are both terrible and the director doesn't even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing avoid this non scary pitiful little excuse
<START> any time a movie feature a dwarf or a midget in a prominent role the odds are 10 to 1 that the director threw him in because he didn't know what else to do to keep the movie interesting in this case the featured little guy isn't all that bad he manages to keep his dignity for most of his scenes except the part where he drags the leading man down the stairs of the dungeon but the movie itself uses him like a doggie chew toy br br the problem here is a common one with low budget exploitation movies there's a germ of a decent idea in here but the director and the screenwriter don't know how to develop it a good director would take the various story elements brain transplants mad doctors with secret labs and a dungeon car chases fist fights dim witted monstrous frankenstein style assistant mind control betrayal and conspiracy etc and make an exciting involving film full of cheap thrills and fun br br instead what we get here is a bunch of people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab then a cheesy operation where the patient bleeds paint followed by some of the same people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab some more followed by another subgroup of the initial group driving around and having an accident followed by a dungeon escape scene that is mostly about a woman putting her shoes back on followed by a rooftop chase the actual high point of the movie followed by a confusing series of events where everyone in the movie apparently escapes from everyone else followed by a lovely stroll in the countryside where everyone either chases bumps into attacks or escapes from everyone else again followed by well not much else br br somewhere in here is a scary peroxide blonde dressed in white a well meaning heroic type who is sort of blandly good looking a three foot lab assistant a big lunk with a mass of melted rubber pasted to one side of his face a kid who wonders into the middle of the movie to provide more of the frankenstein factor a brunette who sort of falls in love with the hero for no apparent reason and the mad doctor himself who must be the luckiest man in the history of evil super villains because nothing goes according to his plan but things work out for him anyway and all because he remembered to stick an into the transplanted brain at one point in the operation br br this was by no means the worst movie i've seen or even the worst exploitation movie i've seen or even the worst badly made exploitation movie i've seen but it just lies there oozing cheapness and inattention to detail at every point and there is no real reason for even bad movie enthusiasts to watch it
<START> the title is from a passage in the bible 28 28 let's just say it is taken horribly out of context but nonetheless that is where the title of this agonizing movie originates the other reviewers cover the plot details so i wont rehash but the husband who is a psychiatrist delivers a lecture on inferior function where he discusses how a person can meet another another person and they can experience a cataclysmic crisis in their lives where they cease to be masters of themselves and incapable of fair judgement he is saying this at the podium at the exact moment as he lays eyes on leonora vail in the audience the woman who will become his mistress not very subtle for showing that this is indeed what will happen to this poor man br br i think the whole premise of the movie is implausible and just didn't work here is an over the hill psychiatrist and we are to believe this young beautiful woman falls for him and comes between the happiness he and his wife shared what's even more implausible is how the betrayed wife responds when she learns of the infidelity not only is she understanding but she insists her husband embark on a several month vacation with the tramp so we all can get a little relief from this unbearable stress give me a break i wanted to reach through the screen and throttle not just the adulterer but the dim wit wife br br the fact that the whole movie takes place as a flashback after already revealing the end of the movie at the beginning the fact that the husband had a terrible accident it leaves no doubt as to the outcome of the sordid affair i think this was a poor decision as it leaves absolutely no plot twists to look forward to as the whole movie is completely predictable you already know the wife's resignation to the affair at the beginning of the film as she summons the mistress to the dying man's bedside and expresses no ill will towards her br br not only is the script defective but noel coward is horribly miscast even though it is his screenplay he and leonora have absolutely no chemistry on screen whatsoever its interesting that michael redgrave was originally cast in that role but was replaced during filming i wonder what that was about in the end neither the husband or the wife cause you to feel any sympathy for either one of them i do think margaret leighton played the part of strumpet quite well but she couldn't possibly overcome all the negatives this film had also as is the case of many british productions of this era the dialogue is hard to understand due to the clipped fast speech pattern of the actors i saw it on tv and couldn't even rely on closed captioning to fill in the blanks for me br br don't waste your time on this one
<START> i first saw this film in austria when it first came out and i was entranced by it it is a passionate and deeply moving work that should be experienced by all connoisseurs of motion picture art what a shame that it has never been released in dvd format perhaps one of these days that will be rectified as it would be a shame indeed if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and left to fade away in some film vault forever br br why is it that 'b' movies like 'american wedding' and get widescreen and fullscreen releases and often a special edition with multiple commentaries and extras while great art pieces like 'the dead' are all but forgotten
<START> lucio fulci a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety ill advisedly tries his hand at black humour in touch of death a made for tv movie about lester parsons brett halsey a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debts br br starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw mincing machine and hungry hogs touch of death starts promisingly enough but fulci soon loses control of proceedings introducing a weird sub plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed scenes there are several more graphic murders which in true fulci fashion are extremely violent and gruesome but even the high level of bloodletting doesn't stop this from being one of fulci's poorer efforts br br as i have found with many of his other movies a comprehensible storyline is not exactly high on the agenda when lucio is behind the camera this film has many peculiarities which left me more than little perplexed why didn't lester dispose all of his victims using the dismemberment method seen at the beginning why are all of his victims either hairy or disfigured what the hell is that ending all about br br fulci is considered by many to be one of the of horror cinema i don't understand his popularity finding the majority of the films of his that i have seen so far to be generally lacking both decent narratives and technical proficiency touch of death certainly does nothing to change my opinion
<START> others' main criticism of this film namely that macy suddenly looks jewish upon donning his glasses is misplaced the glasses are just the little bit of change needed to convince others he's a jew the scene in which he says to his boss paraphrasing but you know what my background is along with another discussion with his mother suggests that he's had to fight this same assumption in the past the glasses now make him look just jewish enough to confirm his and co workers' existing suspicions then there is his new wife's large nose and taste for loud clothes which of course means she's jewish the whole point of the film is how those little stereotypical nothings become the entire basis for judging others br br if he has a lisp he must be gay if he has long hair he smokes dope if he's hispanic he's got a knife and if he has round black glasses and he's slight of build he must be jewish those statements all sound equally im plausible to me if the conclusion people were jumping to in focus was reasonable the whole point of the story would be lost
<START> this movie was a pleasant surprise for me in all honesty the previews looked horrible up until the point where emma thompson and alan rickman appeared so i rented it with reservation but i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it had great acting a few good plot twists and of course emma thompson and alan rickman it's definitely worth checking out
<START> based on the book space vampires by colin wilson this is in my humble opinion one of the best pieces of sci fi horror to come out of the eighties the effects done by ilm still hold up by todays standards the actors are mostly british and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realism br br the film was panned by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic tobe hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for it's low but for whatever reason it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and well paced plot br br not to be over looked
<START> this movie gives golf a high mark it was well acted and well directed giving you a view of history that some non sports fans will enjoy the historic factor alone gives it a high rating the golf course was really done well i am in the northeast and have seen as a fan and as someone who loves the game the movie was well done on all levels a must see 5 stars the acting was superb disney has another winner in its bag of great movies if for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life i would tell you that the setting while in the late 1800's and early 1900's is very realistic the costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film a must see for fans and non fans alike
<START> rita hayworth is just stunning at times and for me the only reason to watch this silly film despite the overdone 1940s lipstick rita was one of the all time glamor women of hollywood in fact for a couple of years i can't imagine anyone that looked better except maybe elizabeth taylor in her prime br br anyway the co star of the show gene kelly does not play his normal likable at least the kind of guy we all know him from in singin' in the rain here kelly's danny mcguire pouts much of the time phil silvers who i loved on tv at sgt bilko is so stupid in here as genius you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokes and they are stupid br br the visuals are good with great technicolor which almost looks terrific you get to see a lot of pretty women in here too not just hayworth unfortunately the story isn't all that much it centers around hayworth deciding about a career choice along the way we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultingly dumb ending all in all an unmemorable film except as a showcase for hayworth's beauty
<START> during production this series was titled to the moon' a title that everyone on set at the time thought was cheesy enough then word came through that it had been retitled for the moon' as if this the addition of this new word would evoke heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters this same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the very fabric of the entire series and the same tired and boring love triangle storyline is actually stretched out over 7 episodes any television program that decides to use the 'love storyline for even a single episode is pushing it but to smear it over seven episodes is unforgivable there are reasons to watch however with the scenery of the isle of wight certainly providing a beautiful setting and the seemingly effortless performance of lynda hitting all the right comedy marks this however is not enough a number of performances are noticeable especially when placed against the static and emotionless wasteland which jonathan kerrigan refers to as his face i have already mentioned lynda in the role of mother' yes thats as far as character development and back story goes but i was impressed by the actor maurice roeves who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast having appeared in everything from classic movies such as richard attenborough's 'oh what a lovely war' and 'the eagle has and tv including baywatch city the bill eastenders cheers doctor who in the 80s star trek and even going to hollywood with stallone in judge dredd whose performance reminded me very much of actual teachers i have met often incapable men whose lives are tinged with a very sad streak it is refreshing to see that roeves is still getting work having also appeared in the 1998 british film 'the acid house' and even more recently alongside the wonderful maria bello and sean bean in 'the dark' the standout reason to watch this series even though his appearances are very few another actor who tries his hardest to elevate the program is ben miles in the role of the sex mad 'typical man' brother once again what an original character as with roeves the cv says it all after elevating this miles has since appeared in the hollywood movie for and the 2001 star studded film 'the affair of the alongside brian cox adrien brody christopher walken and jonathan pryce unfortunately the fairly capable actors i have mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles in comparison to the dramatic driftwood that is kerrigan and todd both of whom seem to have been in casualty for too long and haven't yet learned to act even the tolerable frances grey is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins and unfortunately for her the lasting memory i have of her from the set is of the ad asking for another take of a relatively complex shot because during the take she subconsciously her knickers out of her crack ' familiar faces appear in each episode child actors from cbbc programs and dramas such as point 4 children' and other regulars from commercials such as mr ben's they'll remember me for this lynda 'the lady' and others that i don't even want to remember each episode tries to with such as teenage pregnancy disruptive pupils and rocket building things that grange hill was doing better when my parents were young overall this series was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to craft a genuinely interesting and well developed drama series unfortunately for them they took the easy route both in the writing and for the most part in the casting i would recommend both road' and 'the street' to fans of good drama the latter in particular which managed to achieve this if you like the isle of wight don't for the moon' reach for the holiday brochure instead it probably contains more character development
