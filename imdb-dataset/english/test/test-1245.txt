<START> wonderful movie adult content lots of erotic scenes plus excellent music and dance scenes my wife and i absolutely loved this movie and wish they'd make more like it
<START> i just caught farewell to the king on cable and maybe it's just because i'm a girl but i thought this was on the craptastic side the script and direction are pretentious once i found out john milius was responsible it all became clear the supporting actors actually weren't bad james fox was outstanding the biggest disappointment was nick nolte who i usually enjoy once he goes native he starts speaking a very stiff stilted english and half the time he seems kind of distracted as if he'd just smoked some of the bounty of rain forest and then the end what the just happens to be on the same boat as the botanist by the way had the botanist dumped the girlfriend or what the boat just happens to run conveniently close to an island ripe takeover by a crazy anglo ex army deserter
<START> poor shirley maclaine tries hard to lend some gravitas to this mawkish gag inducing feel good movie but she's trampled by the run away sentimentality of a film that's not the least bit grounded in reality br br this was directed by curtis hanson did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him hanson can do effective drama sprinkled with comedy as evidenced by wonder boys so i don't know what happened to him here this is the kind of movie that doesn't want to accept that life is messy and fussy and that neat tidy endings however implausible they might be might make for a nice closing shot but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go through br br my wife and i made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred e g the old man's going to teach her to read and then drop dead bingo this is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches summarizing their emotional problems making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they're that aware of what's causing them toni collette a fine actress by the way and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them spelling out in flashing neon the film's awkward connecting motif at that moment i knew what i was in for and the film was a downward spiral from there br br grade c
<START> this is a tedious movie the real villains are the clunky adaptation it's embarrassingly easy to tell that the source material was a novel and witless screenplay br br on the credit side considering the budget was tight due to wartime austerity the look of the film isn't at all bad and the performances are by and large ok except for phyllis calvert who is terrific a miracle considering the potential for a pit into which she most definitely does not fall ms calvert with a lot less to go on is as accomplished as olivia de havilland in gone with the wind br br the one absolutely unbearable aspect of the man in grey is the dreadfully conceived depiction of a black serving boy no matter that he's meant to be a sympathetic character played badly by a white boy in black face make up it is impossible to by pass this example of condescending racism br br grim
<START> the performances by the male leads make this long hard journey west interesting throughout the soundtrack by the sons of the pioneers is one of the most beautiful i have every heard the journey itself is somewhat episodic and joanne dru is badly miscast overall this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt western
<START> watched this on with frank baxter commenting as i recall have never seen it since but would like to find out where it is available br br it is amazing how good something can be but be in black and white and have zero special effects in fact amazing how much better something like that is
<START> i've been watching attack of the show religiously for about 6 months maybe longer but not much i was very infatuated with olivia and i found kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me first my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called around the net that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like youtube that are generally funny or of people getting hurt inadvertently some intentionally umm this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same stuff i really haven't seen anything that good and i can only laugh at people actually probably breaking their necks and being paralyzed so many times the show is like a late show wanna be colbert report wanna be with it's politics also if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal this humor gets old also mccain is old yeah yeah whatever libs have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that would endear themselves as having a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves so it's almost every show bash mccain or palin sheesh so we get the same old of people getting hurt that we are supposed to keep laughing at and then some leftist political humor that never at itself out of it's own weakness i'll keep watching since i watch at work and it's all that's on hoping that i'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old i did like the fill in host's of chris and alison though they were actually a good change of pace maybe this show could do a rotating host thing olivia who i thought at times in the beginning was really funny has resorted to this constant pouting response and it's getting old lol 7 of 10 it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger baby boomer like me mid 40's maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do there is a ton of stuff available they could use
<START> there is as many reviews have observed a strong dark streak to this movie the director it most recalls to me is john landis yeah go ahead and howl about what a peasant i am arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a bleak gray kind of way then turning round and exploring the horrors of life with a lighthearted touch br br the cast is without exception above average thomas gibson as david is outstanding as the moody and self deceptive center around whom the rest of the characters revolve he talks a good nihilist but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993 it was difficult to look at him and see greg montgomery let alone agent of criminal minds br br perhaps not the best scene but the one i enjoy most my rewind scene is the section where candy is expecting a visitor and one uninvited person after another shows up at the door as candy's interpersonal environment swings further and further out of control david just grows bouncier and more enthusiastic like a gaunt gen x
<START> with such a promising cast and a director that i have heard great things about i was utterly disappointed by this film it started off with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely muddled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes and yes i did watch the full length version i love robert deniro and as usual he did a fine acting job but in all his other gangster films no matter how many people he kills i always still had respect for his character but in this movie he was a lowlife drug addict rapist with no care for anyone but himself also james woods another fine actor had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him i thought the parts where robert deniro called him crazy and he flipped out came completely out of left field and towards the end the writers just throw in this random comment about how his father died in a nut house and that's why james woods didn't like being called crazy so much was left undeveloped in this movie also we never find out who the men are in the beginning that are trying to kill noodles and we never find out more about joe pesci's character it seems that the writers threw together about five different stories and never fully explained any of them the only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young kids the story ran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job overall i was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and i don't see how anyone can even compare this to the godfather 1 and 2 or even goodfellas i am sad that i wasted four hours of my life watching this film
<START> louis khan was one of the most influential architects of our time and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew his son's desire to find out who and more importantly what he was is moving and emotional br br this film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about what good design is and the emotional price that is paid for it equally haunting is the sound track if you see the film and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening as a practicing architect of over 30 years my heart ached and rejoiced over the film and its very straight forward albeit emotional honesty and sincerity br br i had the honor of seeing this film previewed in chicago at the national convention of the american institute of architects the film was introduced by daniel and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session afterward during the entire presentation of the film not a sound not a cough not one distraction took place the entire audience sat mesmerized and the real treat was daniel's mother was present during the showing of the film br br i will always remember the film and play it over constantly in my mind every time i listen to the soundtrack
<START> warner brothers tampered considerably with american history in big trail director raoul walsh's first rate western they died with their boots on a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer george armstrong custer the film chronicles custer from the moment that he arrives at west point academy until the indians massacre him at the little big horn this is one of errol flynn's signature roles and one of raoul walsh's greatest epics walsh and flynn teamed in quite often afterward and they died with their boots on reunited olivia de havilland as flynn's romantic interest for the last time they appeared as a couple in seven previous films this 140 minute black white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences humorous romantic scenes and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries one of the notorious errors involves colonel philip sheridan who is shown as the commandant at west point before the civil war indeed sheridan was a lieutenant at this point in fact the commandant was robert e lee as the earlier flynn film santa fe trail showed another historical lapse concerns lieutenant general whitfield scott scott was not the commander of union troops throughout the civil war warner brothers presented custer as a drinker probably because flynn had a reputation for drinking but in real life custer neither drank nor smoked nevertheless these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film br br they died with their boots on opens with custer riding into west point military academy in a fancy dress uniform with an african american carrying his luggage and tending his dogs after the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future instead of a high ranking foreign general the sergeant turns custer over to a ranking cadet ned sharp arthur kennedy of city for conquest to take charge of him sharp plays a practical job on custer by installing him in the quarters of major romulus stanley of task force who promptly runs custer out naturally the volatile custer attacks sharp in a public brawl general phil sheridan john litel of the sons of katie elder is prepared to dismiss custer from west point for conduct unbecoming as it turns out sheridan cannot expel custer because custer has not enrolled once he enrolls custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate galore when the american civil war erupts west point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat one of the last cadets hustled off to war is custer avid as he is to get into the fight custer encounters his future wife elizabeth 'libby' bacon olivia de havilland of santa fe trail and they pledge themselves to each other despite mr bacon gene lockhart of carousel who detests the sight of custer it seems that bacon ran across custer at a saloon and insulted one of custer's friends and our hero reprimanded bacon br br meanwhile back in washington custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment but major has him cooling his heels custer befriends rotund lieutenant general winfield scott sidney greenstreet of the maltese falcon and they share an appetite for creamed bermuda onions that becomes one of custer's characteristics not only does scott see to it that assigns custer to the second cavalry but also custer appropriates horse to get to his command during the battle of bull run 21 july 1861 custer disobeys orders from none other than sharp strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital custer receives a medal rather than a court martial when confederate general jeb stuart threatens the union army at the battle of gettysburg in pennsylvania scott is shocked by the chance that the south may triumph when a brigadier general cannot be found scott into promoting the first available officer a mistake is made and custer is promoted incredulous at first custer embraces the moment and cracks stuart's advance after the war custer down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds eventually libby intercedes on his behalf with general sheridan who was in command of the army and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th cavalry when he takes command custer finds the 7th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that sharp commands the liquor at the fort meanwhile custer has his first run in with crazy horse anthony quinn of the guns of and takes him into custody of course crazy horse escapes becomes custer's adversary and they fight br br once custer has quelled crazy horse and the indians sharp with as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the sioux and other indian nations they also see to it that custer is brought up on charges for striking in a saloon brawl on his way to washington custer discovers the perfidy of sharp and who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred black hills settlers rampage in and the indians hit the warpath custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the little big horn in a slam bang showdown against 6000 stagecoach lenser bert captures both the grit and the glory the long shot of the 7th cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular as an added premonition of custer's imminent demise libby faints after he leaves their quarters for the little big horn they died with their boots on benefits from a top notch max steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune gary owen
<START> masterpiece carrot top blows the screen away never has one movie captured the essence of the human spirit quite like chairman of the board 10 10 don't miss this instant classic
<START> that is the answer the question is what is the single reason to watch this movie i loved her in my name is julia ross that is one of the best films noir of all time noir or whatever one may call it it's a very unsettling movie br br she is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time too that would be the guilt of janet ames this one has a spooky promising title it has a good cast it has a fine director i was expecting something dark maybe something a little tawdry instead it's an uninspired routine espionage movie it's pretty much is a total bore at least it was to me ms foch is captivating and that is about it
<START> the golden door is the story of a sicilian family's journey from the old world italy to the new world america salvatore a middle aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in sicily take the arduous journey across the raging seas and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk in short they believe that by risking everything for the new world their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled the imagery of the new world is optimistic clever and highly imaginative silver coins rain from heaven upon salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the new world carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the new world will yield all of this imagery is interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the sicilian people helps provide hope while they're aboard the ship to the new world br br the voyage to the new world is shot almost in complete darkness especially when the seas roar and nearly kill the people within the dark reality i referred to is the old world and the journey itself to the new world the old world is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive this is shown as salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left donkeys goats and rabbits in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the new world i thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the new world it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit the most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the new world this shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another depicting the separation between the old and new worlds this shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise br br as later contrasted to how the new world visually looks the old world seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy new world i thought it was particularly interesting that the statue of liberty is never shown through the fog at ellis island but is remained hidden i think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the statue of liberty stands for give me your poor your tired your hungry seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the new world once they arrived in the americas they had to go through rather humiliating tests i e mathematics puzzles etc in order to prove themselves as fit for the new world these tests completely changed the perspectives of the sicilian people in particular mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the new world feeling more violated than treated with respect where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the new world would provide the reality of what the new world required was disparaging and rude salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually was seemed disappointing to him this attitude was shared by mostly everyone who with him their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted br br the film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society cleanliness marriage and intelligence are prerequisites adhering to these rules is to prevent disease immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating perhaps this is a commentary on how america has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct though the rules seemed rigid they were there to protect and help the people flourish
<START> in comparison to other sand and sandal fare the egyptian leaves much to be desired the film is very loosely based upon well researched novel which centers around the egyptian physician adventures at the court of as well as his travels throughout minoan crete and africa unfortunately due to the moral strictures of the time much of story which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits remains on the cutting room floor and instead the audience is treated to reels and reels of victor mature's wooden acting even gene tierney Â a leading lady staple of the time Â can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather somnambulistic performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time there is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism vs but michael wilding is so tiring as the revolutionary that one is surely cheering for someone to off him and restore the old religion before the second reel my advice buy the book from e bay rent something more entertaining like solomon and sheba and then call it a night
