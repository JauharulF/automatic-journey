<START> frank langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in i love watching him i was 10 yrs old 1979 when i seen him for the first time i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in hopefully one day i can see him in person he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong he is very attractive even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning in my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen i adored him in dracula along with a lot of other girls out there and in god created woman house of d jason and the argonauts and many more i thought he was genius can't wait to see him in good night and good luck
<START> no just no that's all that needs to be said br br summary a random guy is in a cornfield for some reason i'm not sure but it's his duty to run around inside the next great thriller br br a five year old could make a better movie just filming an or even just grass growing seriously br br you can't say it has bad acting because there is no acting you can't say it has bad writing because it has no writing you can't say it has bad cinematography because there is no cinematography you can't say it's a bad movie because there is no movie if you don't believe me go watch it just don't say i never warned you
<START> i first started watching the outer limits back in 95 when i was 10 and it just blew my mind every week with each episode every episode had a twist and each week i couldn't wait for the next how the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me this show manages to teach us about life robotics alien and human encounters and an insight into more of the paranormal and how it affects the people what really makes this a good show are the characters in each episode they really show emotion and are really good actors what you'll also notice each week is an actor actress you'll know from a past show which is pretty neat in its own way br br if you wanna chill out and sit back with a good sci fi show then the outer limits is for you
<START> having not read the original book or seen the earlier film and indeed knowing nothing about the storyline of either of those or the current film i came to this film with an open mind br br it's really difficult to know where to start a comment on the film because the whole thing seems so confused it seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film but what that is remains completely obscure br br the effects were fantastic and very well judged the idea was set up really well with the motivation for time travel clearly made out however it was downhill from here br br all of the time travel seems to have only the vaguest connection to the quest that was set out at the start there are some nice ideas but they seem to be isolated occurrences that really do not flow and make the film seem disjointed and lost at one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon br br when arrives in 701 a d the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything of importance about the and while it seems clear that there is something to find out what it is remains annoyingly elusive this is quite an odd change from the previous time travel instances and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story so many things happen that there should be an explanation for but there is no discovery i really really wanted to know what the film was getting at what there was to uncover but to no avail having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point it seems like there has been a very half hearted attempt to render this in the film but it has been so simplified and dumbed down that the meaning and context is completely lost br br just as we hope that we are finally to discover where this is all leading the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction and becomes a mindless action film without any real action it is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film by now countless significant things are happening without any explanation fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason the film comes to an abrupt end as decides to stay with the br br in summary after a good start the film is very disappointing too much time is spent on adventures before arriving with the however the worst part of the film is what i think is the most important part the setting up of the situation with the the whole point is completely missed and this undermines the rest of the film after this the film concentrates too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place with so many things happening without explanation the film just seems to get lost and lose direction however the finale where decides he is no longer bothered about time travel is the most inexplicable of all br br ultimately the whole film seemed like a collection of unconnected incidents the meaning and context was lost although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious what was so frustrating about it all though was that there was clearly so much potential here it wasn't by any means a bad film it just so easily could have been so much better the start was very promising the time travelling looked fantastic and would have worked had it not gone off on tangents and experience with the could so easily have worked had a few more of the right questions been asked and had there not been such a temptation to dumb down and simplify i just wish i had a time machine so that i could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes that were made
<START> films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me in the hands of an insightful artist who examines all the twisted little details of the mundane the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing and i love the french cinema br br this film was about the mundane it didn't have a much of a plot it was just characters who lived in a town very normal people and stuff just happened but it wasn't very interesting stuff and it wasn't examined very insightfully the film did capture a bit of a mood but it wasn't a particularly captivating mood and while i can't think of much that the film did specifically wrong it failed on just about every level to do anything right br br there were a lot of characters in this film a lot of them kind of looked alike so it was hard to figure out who was who and what were their relations to one another i don't mind putting some effort into understanding a film or even watching an especially complex film more than one time to iron out the details but this one was a puzzle not worth the solving for me br br the only good thing i can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant functional not brilliant but pleasant the camera often captured some nice postcard type shots but it rarely found the really interesting little details br br i've seen a handful of not so good films so far at the seattle international film festival but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits rolled i sensed a big collective sigh of relief when the film was finally over but i suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it br br 4 10
<START> i bought this movie for about 2 5 dollars at a local flea market i thought that with the cast present in this movie ice t rob lowe mario van peebles are all ok it would be pretty good boy was i wrong this movie annoyed the hell out of me almost every scene drags on too long the scene where rob lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever it was one of the worst scenes i have ever witnessed in a movie the rest is no either my guess is when they finished the movie they only had 30 minutes of film so they made everything last longer br br conclusion the current 1 9 rating here on imdb is right on the money this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen go watch some paint dry for 1 5 hour instead of watching this br br if you want to see some better movies made by this director watch with christopher lambert ice t or with charlie sheen instead
<START> i walked into blockbuster to watch some good old fashion action movies so i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter sandra bullock an action movie with sandra bullock in it and it's rated r yay although i will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'speed' then i was sold sadly sandra really is not in this movie her role is minor panicky kidnapped girlfriend she is in fifth place on the actors listing for shakes apparently this was her first movie role and after watching this movie i figured as much sandra is the only living human in this movie everyone else might as well be a zombie in a b horror flick this movie deceived me saying sandra was the lead i fell for it like biff from 'back to the future' when marty yells what's that god i wish i watched that instead of this br br sandra is the only bright side of this movie every time she is on camera it is like she is picking up shock paddles and yelling clear to get this movies going but it flat lines no matter how hard she tries more on sandra later br br the movie is dull very dull think of the dullest moment in your life then imagine living through that moment for 110 minutes for me it is this movie this movie even somehow makes gun fights and bullet time effects boring so boring that elephant tranquilizers are put to shame and this movie's idea of bullet time is a close up of an ak in slow motion which mocks you as the caps spitting out of it represent each second of your life as it slowly ticks away and i knew i was watching a bad movie because i found myself fast forwarding through the action the plot there was a plot music even by 80s muck standards is bad but at least it's the one thing that kept me awake acting sandra bullock was good and ummm moving on is it any good since it is rated r no unless r stands for ridicules snooze fest br br and it is really 80s clichÃ© when a movie opens with an overhead view of a city rocking guitar licks or power ballet and ends with a gun fight in a grim factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes both of which this movie satisfies at least this movie establishes what era it's from which was unnecessary since sandra's hair was screaming 1980s and a movie gets really ham fisted when you watch an assassin stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box which you respond to sadly saying that is probably the most action that poor sap ever got another hammy moment is at the beginning when some secret agent dude caps a crowd of people and apparently this movie thinks people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die all that scene needed was the mario death ditty or maybe contra sound effects but nintendo might have sued br br and it is sad when the main action hero of this movie rips off other better movie icons before the big gun scene da hero is found standing in a boxing ring anyone sporting a leather fedora not jones' too with an ominous spotlights behind him terminator the 2nd before owning t 1000 what is really really sad is that people on youtube or can film better quality videos with a crappy webcam no less then this movie i'm serious most rant videos recorded with bad audio and blurry picture are more entertaining then this movie i cannot even call this movie by it's given name for it's very name bring back horrid memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment a freaking violation against human rights the only bright speck in this dark abysmal abyss is sandra's career started taking off thanks to this movie but oh sandra why did you have to be in such a nightmare the paycheck better been worth it the dvd also graces you with a little back story on sandra as an extra seen how she is the only one from this movie who end up being a house hold name which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs crafty little critter br br i don't have much experience with bad films but i know bad when i see it i could bounce back from 'mazes and monsters' with a good old campy bruce willis comedy but not even bruce could cheer me up after this movie i have yet to see any ed wood or uwe boll but i think i'm amped for them now for i can't even fathom a movie worse then gag
<START> when i sat down in the cinema to see this i was expecting to see a sort of stylish tongue in cheek action film which had been implied by the trailers however it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be more br br normally i don't approve of films that try to entertain in as many ways possible for instance this film tries to mix action with comedy romance lightheartedness and gritty seriousness all at once most of the time this sort of approach doesn't work in films just look at batman forever but i was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they pulled it off br br the end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature however the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes robert carlyle and jonny lee miller pull of a brilliant double act and ken does a excellent villain this mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch br br however the big let down here for me is that in having 'the gentleman there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in and there were few belly laughs okay so the lines weren't terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent british films ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of hollywood's efforts
<START> cimarron was painful to sit through although irene dunn does a good job with the heavy handed script richard pompous and overacted role is brutal the passage of time has not treated the character of isaiah as well as other racial and religious notions well although the movie is somewhat progressive on the roles of women and the mistreatment of native americans the editing is especially weak this is without a doubt the worst of all the best pictures
<START> i don't see why everyone is bombing this so much i thought it was a great fun time that sadly wasn't popular enough to be that famous believe me i have seen much much worse than this if you want a bad movie see blood shack or the alien dead or something so what this is normal slasher fare but better than most and it is watchable this movie also has one of the best soundtracks i've heard some of the music is very suspenseful and the death scenes are cool too we see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words sold written in blood on the mirror and we also get a cool double beating by a toilet with razors attached to it this was a good fun 80s slasher that's definitely worth your time despite what others say about it
<START> my take on the ending bobby died at the hands of his step father mike had tried as he may to get bobby out only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly bobby died mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind on how bobby left mike made a plane that flew bobby out children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive br br was also great seeing my old housing area we called it san jose boulevard and i lived right around where these house were filmed it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses not studios it was my kitchen bedroom and living room and those hills we use to hike them as kids looking down on our little valley seeing glimpses of the bay was a real nostalgia trip for me
<START> the first time i watched it was when it came out 1994 and the last time i watched it was just before writing this review it still makes me laugh my brains out after all these years it dose not disappoint truly the smartest bollywood comedy ever made this is one indian movie which deserves its place in the imdb top 250 aamir khan and salman khan in probably one of their best performances in comedic roles the thing that makes this one a time less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing the jokes are refreshing and not cheap this is one film truly ahead of its time if you haven't seen it yet go watch it now
<START> if you loved the early 60's version of the time machine don't waste your time as with last year's the planet of the apes this has been reimagined and not for the better and just as with planet its lead actor is woefully miscast and leaden guy pearce a terrific actor of great range is all wrong for this role giving a one note performance that elicits zero sympathy he's so dour and serious and lacking in awe of the supposedly amazing things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he's experiencing them worse yet whose idea was it for him to resemble the love child of david spade and calista a handsome actor here he is sickeningly gaunt which is believe it or not a major distraction frankly the man looks gravely ill and is photographed cruelly he shares absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the screen a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone else's sadly even with a proper leading man this movie doesn't stand a chance for it is fatally burdened with both a totally inept director whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized and a screenplay that is utterly inferior scattered and at times incoherent not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this film for the single fact that there is nothing in the way of character development in the original you got to know the so therefore you felt for them and felt their terror of the here as the movie stresses several times they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly unless you're a member of peta scared sheep are hardly the stuff of entertainment br br samantha does as well as possible in her movie debut but like everyone else in this mess most especially jeremy irons if he's the leader of the who look like rejects from the mummy returns why then does he look like edgar winter's long lost brother is completely wasted also wasted was the money spent on the endless 'special' effects which belie the 70m spent on the film they are uniformly lackluster obvious and unconvincing and then there's the look of the film poorly photographed its art direction and sets are just there and its costumes are typical in design there isn't an original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen most of all it isn't even fun the filmmakers use the now ubiquitous orlando jones as comic relief but as usual jones is irritating and just how does his electrically driven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity br br all in all this is an empty lifeless dull sterile and confused affair didn't they already remake planet of the apes at least that had the fortune of some strong performances br br spoiler the final insult beyond a head shakingly terrible not to mention convenient ending not only do they barely feature the changing dress store figures they make even the time machine itself an anachronistic gaudy glass n bore if the sopranos had a time machine this is exactly what it would look like pathetic
<START> fantastic madonna at her finest the film is funny and her acting is brilliant it may have been made in the 80's but it has all the qualities of a modern hollywood block buster i love this film and i think its totally unique and will cheer up any droopy person within a matter of minutes fantastic
<START> well acted yes very well i must say even though i don't speak nice cinematography but the script is lame really lame a predictable soap opera in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen ok maybe the ending isn't as predictable but is it any good it is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already and forget about the day after br br i just got a note from imdb saying that my comment was not long enough that's really sad because i have no idea of what else to say about this movie which actually says a a lot about it don't you think the thing is it has no soul and no originality compare this movie with barrio or riff raff shot more than ten years ago or the extraordinary recently shot the child it's sad to see that this is a much worse film
