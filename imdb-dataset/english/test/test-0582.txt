<START> pretentious claptrap updating herman melville about a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long lost sister who has been raised by gypsies or something like that Â not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes pseudo symbolic imagery the siblings swimming in a river of blood and other bizarre touches a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve who at least gets to bathe in the nude i was expecting a lot more from this one apparently there's an even longer tv version of x out thereÂ
<START> i have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed and in my opinion this movie lacks heart i frankly didn't care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie br br there was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn't because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life or trying so hard not to that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it i have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough but i felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and i was left wondering what the point was or if the point of the movie was that it had no point honestly while i didn't feel like tearing my hair out during the movie i did remorse the lost time on the sad little film br br i have no doubt that some people will love this movie but frankly i didn't
<START> i went into this movie expecting a piece about how to be accepted in culture and i wound up blowing 8 50 on a 10 minute fart joke and a whole bunch of fake accents sorry jeff but if you're going for the whole cult thing you gotta a while to go
<START> the falcon and the snowman is the story of two young men a cia employee and a drug dealer who become disenchanted with united states foreign policy and sell state secrets to the soviet union the events of the film are based on a true story br br timothy hutton and sean penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations the supporting cast also performs well notably with a performance from david suchet of hercule poirot fame as a seasoned soviet agent br br the film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in however it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle the ending however is tense stunning and effective there are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesn't fit with a spy story there are other spy films more worth seeking out than the falcon and the snowman but it is a decent film none the less
<START> just watched this on dvd three times once the 'normal' way once with the scenes in consecutive order in this doozy of a film noir the beginning middle and end of the story intertwine and once with the director's commentary running quite amazing a bare bones tale told with more flair energy and substance than most big budget overblown features being released today br br i think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent memento which turned me on to nolan in the first place can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget and bigger box office stars in his next film insomnia
<START> this movie was not very well directed they almost totally disregarded the book i guess they were trying 2 save time the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played was cute some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book major parts of the book were once again chopped out you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary also i was surprised not pleasantly by a new character that was no where in the book one of my favorite characters leper was poorly interpreted and portrayed he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book over all disappointing
<START> i viewed the movie for a second time on september 30 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time i saw it i thoroughly enjoyed the acting especially uncle benny i thought that fred carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this film the story line definitely kept your interest and i hope this movie makes it all the way to the top i felt it moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end well lets just say i didn't see it coming i also thought that craig the actor who played eddie monroe did an excellent job and i hope that this movie will help him to go further in his acting career from start to finish i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> i rented this film because it was a documentary and highly rated it's more a study of a bastard son trying to find out who his biological father was than anything about architecture br br more than anything else the underlying theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric highly praised possibly genius architect who had little regard for anything or anyone outside is profession br br the tragedy of the film is the broken families he left his baby mothers came across more as scorned fans than irresponsible women which can only have negative results on the children br br that said nathaniel the producer of the film and son of louis khan came across as fairly stable and curious if not bitter the people he interviewed were of course more interested in talking about louis khan's buildings than his personal problems but i find the mix of themes made the film interesting br br as for his buildings i found them like abstract art strange non practical and usually only appreciated by so called critics
<START> just to clarify matthew wasn't a real person but a character combination of 2 killers who were both convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers br br i read the user comments and they react as if matthew was real the character is based on a mixture of two killers elmo patrick and robert lee willie who murdered separate people and the murder itself was based on the one willie committed the conflict of both willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well br br approach is unique in that she not only is ministering to the convicts as they wait for their death and aiding them in taking responsibility for their actions she also reaches out to the victims' families to help them know that the convict did indeed feel remorse for what they did effectively aiding both parties br br everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs on the death sentence it's not my place to say it's right or wrong in theory punishing death with death makes some sort of karmic sense however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days although costly makes more sense to me being stuck in a small room 23 7 with one hour of exercise for the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishment they are technically alive but denied living say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required like susan smith killing her poor kids by shoving her car into a lake i find it fittingly ironic that they would not get that freedom they craved and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned br br point comes through the story very well she has my respect she manages to find that balance she isn't supporting a killer she is guiding them to accepting what they did if they didn't feel some kind of remorse they wouldn't be asking for spiritual guidance br br ona final note when apologizes to parent for killing his son the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didn't apologize for her death i think the point was that throughout the movie denies killing both kids there is doubt in mind he did both killings there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death my thought is that killed the boy and the other man murdered the girl hence was taking responsibility for what he did had he been responsible for the girl's death he probably would have apologized for that as well
<START> i think that the movie was really good subject acting and ali khan's music were marvellous although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male dominated culture he has neglected character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her
<START> i've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since i first caught the trailer and i'm so glad now that i have it's truly a wonderful film the actors are superb the writing is fresh and real the whole thing was just spot on i love james mcavoy in this and i can't wait to see him in the lion the witch and the wardrobe movie this december romola garai is wonderful too be sure to check her out in i capture the castle or nicholas nickleby two of my favorite films overall i think i liked this movie because it didn't chicken out it's a difficult subject matter to tell a story about in that you're very likely to offend a lot of people or mess up and make it into some overly sentimental sugary sweet love fest but they avoided doing that completely and instead made a film that's real honest and touching yes but never over the top very well done amazingly well done go out and see it and you'll know exactly what i mean
<START> the first dh wasn't that great but i really didn't expect it to be but this horrible movie was just beyond criticism i really try to look on the bright side and give movies like this a chance but i just could not find a real good thing about this one i appreciate what bill was trying to do but this movie was just soooooo boring the story of the movie really isn't that bad in fact it's somewhat original but the movie form is really as bad as a lot of people say in my opinion this one ranks right up there with the off season and dracula 3000 i know a lot of people really trash and put down movies like this but i really can't think of any other good things to say about it
<START> i guess by the time i saw this episode i had seen enough twilight zones to have it figured out ahead of time there is this odd assemblage of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a cylinder they are fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in their midst it is his prime directive to escape and so he garners the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder there is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their pasts but no one can remember anything they represent different jobs a piper a ballerina a clown a man in a tattered hat why are they there it leads to an adventure and is resolved at the end but i guess i had a pretty good idea before it all happened
<START> i saw the second part of this beautiful period piece set on a ship sometime in the 19th century book must be responsible for some of the superb dialogue but everything else was good too i especially liked the way they created the period and feeling of being on the ship so well for me this had a feeling of completeness about it which i know i won't be able to convey in words perhaps it was the way they mixed in technical and historical details about sailing in the eighteen hundreds to the story without messing it up benedict was excellent as was the rest of the cast it's not often a mini series sends me to the zone but this one did
<START> if you love chan wook park you know what to expect his films are brutal poetic tragic and artistic with splashes of very grim humor thirst is clearly park's style and i loved every second of it from the cinematography every shot is gorgeous and creative to the story which blends shakespearean tragedy murderous love gothic horror and layered character drama the characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy the direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced like sympathy for mr vengeance there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing chan wook park is an intelligent bold consistently surprising filmmaker it's unpredictable scenes go from brutal and heart wrenching to laugh out loud hilarious in an instant this is closer to lady vengeance then sympathy for mr vengeance as far as being over the top and comical but like lady vengeance it's incredibly rich thought provoking and rewarding br br if you like beautifully told vampire stories let the right one in or are a fan of chan wook park seeing thirst should be obvious easily one of the best films of 2009
