<START> i remember thinking that due to the cast the subject matter and the director i was going to love this movie br br stepping into the theatre and taking my seat i was like a giddy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene built br br i was not disappointed with the opening and felt that i was truly going to love this movie br br if you haven't seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler please stop reading i'm not going to give away anything really important but it might be seen as such so that is the warning br br spoiler may be included below beware br br i think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the russian space station scene i mean honestly refueling a shuttle with no real prior warning and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explode br br while all of this is possible it seemed to me to be way over the top i'm not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting the silly view of the russian technology or just the campy attitude of the scene itself br br it only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in space you know that place where there is no sound because it's a vacuum br br but the coup de grace for me honestly was the gun scene spoiler possibility earlier in the movie we see bruce willis tearing apart their land vehicle the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them drill when he is told that this is what they will be using he is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of what's on it is heavy and not required for what they are doing br br so then as we are wandering onto the asteroids we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehicles you know standard nasa fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in case you know aliens or something br br i could have taken the explosive 2 hours the silly russian space station refueling scene the cheesy love scene near the end the bruce willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters but the steve buscemi going mad and shooting the space gun all over the place and causing havoc damage well that threw the entire thing over the top for me br br save your money and time and avoid this movie if you want a good meteor movie see deep impact if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects see space cowboys but no matter what avoid this flick
<START> this wonderful movie really takes the time to step back and tell the story without words the end of the movie contains almost no dialogue but what is in the minds of the characters is always perfectly clear you know the film is not going to have a happy ending but you leave the film feeling hopeful
<START> this film's a big bore it has a plenty of predictable plots endless sentiments from the start it starts good with a classy number but seems lost midway br br surya on screen chemistry works out really good a good part by bhoomika why include in it he disappears totally after a good half an hour proves his wit again by timing comedy br br tunes sure will last for sometime but he could have done better what ever be the drawbacks still it's worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time pass
<START> this movie moves and inspire you it's like you are one of the family just to see and witness life during the depression era makes you feel humble and grateful jonathan silverman delivered well so convincing and very witty a must see for teens

<START> first off i'm an american i haven't seen any comments on imdb about this series yet from a u s viewer secondly i work in the television business in development so i wallow in much of the sludge that comes out of american broadcast programming unit one is an example of television that's a throwback to what i would attribute as '70s style scripting feature wise namely those films made by young who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for organic character development it tacks more along the lines of stellar british dramas like cracker and prime suspect as well as australia's brilliant underbelly unit one features stand alone cases that are committed then solved each week the mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly byzantine they usually center around one single twist clocking in generally at the 40 minute mark and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter what makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find relatable by episode 2 these are real breathing alive characters that have personal baggage yet it's not a talky batty type of baggage that american flotsam such as grey's anatomy or desperate housewives spoons out these are realistic individuals whose backstories unfold leisurely over the course of the series as if you work with them on a daily basis after the mindless decade of and criminal minds along with their subsequent spawns it's refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with as is the case with unit one the banter the unemotional wooden dialogue and the over the top jeopardy that those american series i mentioned bludgeon us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable danish series i'm on episode 7 of the first season but i've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul if you need explosions and farcically hopped up testosterone along with music by the who and fast cutting neon lit jittery palsy cam action with cipher like main characters as your main diet of television drama viewing i suggest you stay away from this series if you are an adult with a hunger for subtle poignant thoughtful and yes sometimes straight forward procedural crime dramas i urge you to check this show out
<START> this is among one of many usa attempts of remaking a old classic british tv show that's more famous than this one from what i see none of you haven't mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a tv 50's 60's called secret agent man the original secret agent man starred the great patrick mcgoohan the prisoner braveheart ice station zebra the phantom etc a man who was tapped to be the first james bond but he turned it down because mcgoohan was a very devout man and he considered james bond's bed hopping and violent ways to be against his values br br this show was done in black and white and it's a pity for those who haven't seen it you are missing out on a lot the character mr mcgoohan played in secret agent man was named drake and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial tv series called the prisoner the character he played in the prisoner was that of a agent who's identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him what he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the british secret service and on this island the populace don't have names but they are referred to by numbers and character is assigned a number which is 6 it was argued that his prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in secret agent man but mcgoohan himself disputed this br br there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original secret agent man spawned it was written by johnny rivers a famous 50's and 60's pop musician and from what i read some of you are actually think that the song comes from this version of the show you're very wrong about that it was johnny's and it comes from the original tv series so let me help to set the facts straight to those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid well in england it was actually called danger man and in the us it was retitled secret agent man for such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first aired br br granted this current show has little to do with the original no such main character named drake in this one and i guess they did their best to make this show their version of secret agent man but it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series
<START> bela lugosi is a real enigma in the early 1930s he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula yet again and again he made lousy decisions regarding his career perhaps he had a bad agent perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy regardless he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film ranging from excellent horror films such as the raven to big budget flicks like ninotchka to grade z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios interestingly enough although he agreed to do this terrible film he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein as for this movie it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs not a bad thing at all but at the end we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the american looking men he killed were actually japanese the funniest part of this is during a flashback you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to american like men when the camera scans them the men are clearly asian but on all the other non close up shots they are all very western looking many with bald heads they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men i suspect the plot must have undergone a re write and this might account for the obvious mistake or it could just be shoddy production values and editing in fact early in the film they show a street scene in the city and all the cars circa 1942 are old model t fords obviously from stock footage the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull unlike plan 9 from outer space it's hard to laugh at the ineptitude just be put to sleep by it
<START> have you ever watched a film when after it's conclusion your left pondering what in the world it was all about well say hello to scream baby scream it's not that the story's complex or anything like that it's just that it plays out in three completely different modes 1 a fun 60s drug movie 2 a much overplayed soap opera and 3 a horror flick with very little to scream about much to my surprise i've found out that it was written by one of my all time favorites larry cohen well i guess even the best have to learn through trial and error br br playing out much like something from h g lewis only with lesser fx this bad film does have it's perks for most of it's short running time there's a pretty cool jazz score to be heard and there are a couple of memorable scenes one of those being where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long motor bike ride to the zoo the camera tricks the director uses to indicate their hallucinatory state is just plain retarded but amusing trust me when i tell you there's no need to run out of the house to catch this one
<START> this was such a beautiful film such an amazing performance from joseph and brad very innocently written and performed a must see i cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie this is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to watch it does teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should be approaching the harsh subject of aids how we should be teaching our children to cope with it and people around them not only with aids but with any terminal illness i hadn't even heard of this movie until i through t v one day and happen to run across it i recommend everyone to watch this just don't forget your box of tissues more movies should be made like this one extremely heartwarming
<START> to this day i have never seen elizabeth shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie poorly acted poorly plotted and racially neanderthal it took place in a chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club spoiler ahead br br spoiler her blues solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro into it 'nobody leaves without singing the blues' was as dumb as a post the children her character was babysitting were insufferable and well before the movie's end i was wishing for something horrible to happen to all of them br br i have to say though there is one special thing about this movie it takes a lot for a movie to offend me but this smoldering piece of tripe did what chopper the phantom menace and catwoman could not make me sick to my stomach
<START> what a shame what a terrible shame the table was set the candles were lit the guests had arrived and then br br well nothing really just pretentious drivel it could have been great ok maybe not great but it could have been very good all the elements were there but at the end of the day the bottle was empty no lightning how that happened is a mystery with everything at the director's disposal br br the story was quite brave although it certainly needed considerable work with possibly several finishing rewrites to fix the story and tighten up the characters a lot the only thing that was consistently and constantly and unnecessarily tight was the cinematography but i'll get to that but the direction was lousy the acting was just that a c t i n g with a heavy side of cheese and lots of ham and then the cinematography br br well that was something to behold but only if you are in film school's cinematography 101 how to never ever use a professional movie camera under any circumstances obviously the student had fallen asleep through part of the introduction and only heard use a professional movie camera then blissfully back to la la land as the sentence finished off br br what can i say amateurish and pretentious to the last i can only see this film meant to appeal as a chick flick because it's supposed to be sad but then falls flat and just ends up being 'sad' as an excuse for a movie so that even those wouldn't be fooled by this br br ps i felt bad for miss diaz she's a lot better at her craft than what this film allowed her to be even though she was totally totally miscast actually i feel sorry for everyone in this movie except the director and you guessed it the cinematographer i say against the wall for them when the revolution comes ' ok not really after all it was only a movie but perhaps a good tar and feather and running out of town might be more satisfying or at the very least a lot more entertaining br br
<START> no movie could ever do justice to command of the english language but they did a pretty good job here lucas is exactly the way i pictured him in the book as is chick what the movie couldn't really go into was how wasn't liked by the negro people either because he was equally as stubborn not that it is a bad thing but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world yet i got the feeling it was white society's racism that started it and it spilled over into negro society until that became his attitude toward everyone br br the best part of the movie is that you get to see county actually oxford mississippi exactly as faulkner wrote about it the film was made when faulkner was alive and writing it doesn't look that much different today because of this alone the movie is worth a watch considering it is filmed in backyard a true must see for faulkner fans
<START> i went it to see this film with caution a suicidal comedy didn't seem consistent having a brother who is has attempted suicide and seeing the devastation that has caused our whole family i know first hand how crushing it can be to deal with this issue i must say this film deals with it in a way that allows the viewer inside someone who is suffering and simply doesn't know why or how to stop it while the film is not perfect it respects the subject matter and more importantly makes it accessible for the masses i know for our family humor has helped us through a lot of the pain and max and grace is just what it portends to be a suicidal comedy it's funny and i also felt that characters were real and vibrant it's also extremely intelligent yet simple it cuts to the chase and i appreciate that i give it a 9 and will recommend it
<START> this story starts at the end so the film's opening credits advise us unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical b science fiction movie of the 1950's the story is dreary the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget as was often the case in those days br br the story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci fi story br br the scenery consisted of a few rocks bushes and smoke oh yes there was a pool of water as well someone wore a rubber mask with a beak like face and what looked like feathers br br written by lou who penned several sci fi stories around that time including the she creature and it conquered the world the filming was completed in a matter of days not allowing the actors time to develop their characters to better advantage the low budget restraints also prevented this film reaching its potential it could have been a much better film than it turned out to be br br mike connors and richard brought some life to the film but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say 'i enjoyed that film' richard acting career began in 1937 he starred with gregory peck and deborah kerr in an affair to remember and later became more well known on television in the series hawaii five o and the flying doctor series br br directed by roger corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer he has made some good films and is still making them he became very well known for his direction of films from the stories of edgar allan poe often starring vincent price he also made other low budget films some were good and entertaining for one reason or another and most were much better than this br br i would not recommend this film to anyone br br br br 10th september 2007
