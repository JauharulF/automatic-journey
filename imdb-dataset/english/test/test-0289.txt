<START> this is one of cassavetes' best performances the entire cast is outstanding as is martin sublimely understated direction the anger angst and of urban labor battles is magnificently told in a fashion that is neither obtrusive nor patronizing in a way it is dated with its era but in many ways it is gloriously timeless
<START> i recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase i'm going through i was born in 1980 and so film from mid 80s to mid 90s has quite an important place in my growing up br br this particular movie was one of my favourites and so i was thrilled when it became available in the uk it hasn't become worse with time it is still a great fun film with plenty of excitement in its own way sure it pales in the shadow of bigger larger budget films but don't let that stop you enjoying this br br worth a rent or even a purchase at the discount prices you'll find it for
<START> big fat liar in my opinion is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it when jason frankie malcolm in the middle and amanda bynes all that played those tricks on marty paul giamatti doctor dolittle i really smiled and felt good that's what i liked most about this movie as a matter of fact everything that happened after jason's essay erroneously ended up in marty's hands was hilarious i especially loved white's cameo when i first saw him i couldn't be certain but when i asked my mother if it was him she said of course before i wrap this up i'd like to say like i said earlier there is a moral to this story and that moral is always tell the truth now in conclusion if you are a fan of frankie amanda bynes or paul giamatti i highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it
<START> jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of sydney australia following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old jimmy heath ledger who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him the gangsters led by bryan brown are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them that's what makes the film work because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly but this mob tickle your funny bone as well a clever structured script by jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot
<START> the first time i saw this movie i just thought what the hell a 10 year old kid driving around bizarre places meeting bizarre people going after a game called hell yeah i enjoyed this movie a lot br br jordan christopher michael is a brilliant young actor it's a shame he stopped act he interprets very well his character gus on the movie br br gus loses an eye got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with flea drew barrymore and meat loaf want more br br ok don't even try to understand the story but why this movie needs one just open your mind and let gus drive you into this journey br br gus you won
<START> this has to be my favourite film the script is sharp and played to the limit by an excellent miller and fantastic carlisle sharp wit excellent narrative and no hollywood polishing a totally film which has you gunning for the bad guys excels again as the detestable chance while liv tyler truly beats her other lighter performances as the excitement hungry rebecca the soundtrack may not be known to you by name but anyone who has ever seen top gear watched the football or seen any tv action sequence is probably familiar with it particularly due to craig armstrong's 'escape' which must allow him never to work again the soundtrack on first play may seem out of place in a costume drama action comedy but one re watching shows it is perfectly at home in giving the the script it's drama br br my one gripe about this film is that it isn't shown enough on tv where is it truly excellent sharp and classy you'll not regret watching it again and again exits to switch on dvd player
<START> i was truly looking forward to this title it sounded and looked fun the idea of someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs but instead this title only bores first off there is almost no in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment i have to sit through 75 minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the humping a bare breasted chick why on top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot i mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads i wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp i wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue creature from the black lagoon stuff i wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the going on a killing spree or it maybe escaping a silly trap something exciting geez have fun with it be creative who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in a creature flick my advice to the filmmakers keep going your concepts are good but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired have some fun with the creature put the humor in the action and most important put more creature in a creature movie
<START> i loved the first grudge i watched it in an empty theater and in all honesty i was freaked out never before had i heard the unique audio of chilling sounds it truly was gripping br br the grudge 2 however had a couple of good jumps but the story line was real messy and not entirely believable and all over the place with a couple of scenes like a female urinating herself out of fear or another one of a young woman drinking a jug of milk then vomiting it all up again which really made no sense and did not help to enhance the creep factor of the film during these scenes and a couple of others people in the sold out audience actually laughed out loud that was a good indicator to show how this film lacked the thrills chills or creeps the acting was decent the emotions portrayed were believable so hats off to the actors but the cluttered storyline and its lack of direction was something i couldn't shake throughout the entire movie i was annoyed more than anything same old grudge gagging noises a couple of quick unexpected scenes to make me jump but overall i was very disappointed
<START> a political satire of a comedian williams who after dissing the political campaigns and presidents is forced into the running but shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office man of the year is not the funniest movie nor the best but in small doses it does work williams again teaming with levinson after a hit with good morning vietnam the two seem to have a great chemistry and work off each other i am not comparing them to scorsese and deniro but you can get the picture although i wouldn't quite say to rush out there and see the movie in theaters i would recommend renting it this movie is a comedy but also has a great satire please if you like movies like scary movie 4 this is not for you take your brain with you to see it
<START> comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with mike myers' 'austin powers' and rowan atkinson's 'johnny and more recently steve carell in the big screen version of the hit '60's show 'get smart ' br br back in 1974 it was david jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an case full of documents marked 'classified' br br 'the top secret life of edgar briggs' was his first starring role in a sitcom after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as 'six dates with the 'doctor' series and at br br humphrey barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside michael palin terry jones and eric idle in the children's comedy show 'do not adjust your set ' br br 't t s l o e b' cast jason as briggs' a well meaning but incompetent agent for the secret intelligence service whereas john steed wore a bowler hat briggs had a whereas napoleon solo carried a radio pen briggs owned a pipe objects fell to bits in his hands he read confidential documents in bed while his wife barbara angell perused woman's own on one occasion it would be the other way round when he tracked a pair of russian agents to a he accidentally switched on the system and broadcast his plans to capture them when he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an s i s man and his enemy contact it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to brighton when he tried to organise the defection of a female russian scientist he took a 'short cut' to elude his pursuers only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park yet like he always seemed to come out on top at the end much to the dismay of his colleagues br br as previously mentioned he was married his wife jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high rise flat secret service this secret service that you never stop thinking about the secret service he shouted back think of the neighbours they're not supposed to know i'm in the secret service br br briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included street' villain mark eden he was the psychotic alan bradley as michael stainton as and 'doctor at elisabeth as the lovely strong' they answered to 'the played by the late noel coleman the commander was kidnapped in one episode leaving briggs temporarily in charge of the s i s which naturally horrified everyone br br this hilarious show was by richard and bernard mckenna who had written for the 'doctor' series rather than spoof bond it was more of a send up of the serious spy shows such as though it had a bond style theme tune furtive meetings in underground car parks code breaking stolen missile plans that kind of thing jason brought a lot of energy to the role doing a lot of his own stunts such as briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin and were reminiscent of those to be found in the 'pink films br br had all the ingredients to be a smash hit unfortunately it was not networked in the london area it was put out on sundays at 7 25 p m where it was trounced in the ratings by the b b c 's soapy drama 'the brothers' it was then moved to fridays at 7 p m because i t v wanted to showcase its latest american import the t v version of 'planet of the apes' briggs never found an audience a similar fate befell jason's next major show 1976's 'lucky it was not until 1977 and 'a sharp intake of that he found his first successful solo vehicle br br you can see the title sequence along with two brief excerpts in german for this series on youtube unfortunately that is all you can see jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on d v d a great shame for the moment however edgar briggs' life will have to remain top secret br br coda i have seen a number of episodes recently and i'm pleased to say it stands up incredibly well
<START> look we rated this a 10 on entertainment value it's a comedy sure not an epic like lord of the rings or gone with the wind still for comedy particularly these days it's a 10 br br not a long movie moves quickly and easily kelsey grammar right at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel sub pitted against the us nuclear navy in a war game designed to see if terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses kinda ironic this plot pre 911 don't take this topic seriously cause it's mostly laughs from start to finish br br rob schneider is 2nd in command like frank burns and pulls many laughs all the others are perfect for their parts as well rip torn and bruce dern br br look plain and simple you got 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you're not a prude their is some language and innuendo then rent it or buy it we did and enjoy i wish they would make a part 2
<START> what can i say this was hands down the worst movie i have ever seen in my life and believe me some of my favorite movies are admittedly horrible the acting was amateurish the sets were boring and the camerawork was shoddy and sophomoric this whole movie seemed like a college final project i had to keep convincing myself that it was done by a teenager to make it seem somewhat good the most disturbing factor of the film is that it's not even film at all it 's shot on video that was extremely distracting on top of all that the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot line is so basic it makes my eyes water not to mention they steal from at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes or so if there were such a thing as zero stars this movie would get it br br the only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is
<START> the jazz soundtrack makes this seem like a clint eastwood movie br br in fact the whole thing strikes me as burt doing clint the story is good and the movie is full of one liners that i carry with me to this day reynolds to bad guy i'm gonna pull the chain on you pal because you're f'n up my town and you wanna know the worst part you're from outta state br br highlights the reel to reel is nice set dressing for br br charles durning coming unglued while listening to tapes of prostitutes having sort of phone sex you'd have to see it trust me it's hilarious br br brian keith plays against type as a tough guy and does it well br br bernie preoccupation with zen br br rachel ward wow where'd she go br br doc and the tonight show band play their rears off as usual joe william's guests on vocals manhattan transfer re recorded route 66 the soundtrack lends class to the whole affair br br need i say more it might be reynold's best film ever br br yeah he plays himself as usual but it works br br enjoy
<START> the premise is interesting and the cast does the best it can but the script and the directorial effort are so poor that it is not surprising that this film was buried which is fitting given the screenplay as i watched this i could not decide which was worse the screenplay or the directing the actors are over the top the art direction looks like a disney movie the music is contrived and the sentiment so sweet that it gives viewers cavities it's a bad attempt to imitate four weddings and a funeral if one wants to watch comedy that is as flat as a pancake and how poor direction can turn a story into cavity sweetness this is a good one to watch
<START> sorry but i usually love french thrillers e g chabrol but this was a glossy shambolic mess the fact that it was based on a harlan cohen book is telling because rather than being a french film strong on psychology and character it's more like a john grisham esquire roller coaster ride by numbers with ludicrous plot twists flashbacks that update previous flashbacks a predictable villain as soon as his name is mentioned you think 'hmm he'll be the bad guy ' and sets of mysterious stereotyped characters who seem to inhabit different movies by the end i was laughing hysterically at the unevenness of the film's tone the scenes where the lead character is being helped by two streetwise shady characters are unintentionally hilarious the utterly baffling plot the absurd coincidences and strokes of good fortune e g guessing the password for an email account and yawning uncontrollably thought i must have the 1hr 50min running time as it seemed to drag on for 3 hours 50 minutes
