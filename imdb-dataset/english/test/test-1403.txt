<START> i bought this movie from a market stall three years ago i gotta hand it to you when i sat down and watched it i thought this is gonna be another big action b movie ' obviously i was wrong while watching this film i began to realise that this movie was taking me to another planet full of cr p br br i began to get really bored and fed up with this film although i wanted to see was gonna happen in the end i really felt like it was really getting on my nerves br br the people behind the film may've brought some well known name actors into this project but what were they thinking even these actors couldn't save this film br br at the end of the film i felt like this was a waste of money just buying this low life sucker of film for a small amount of money a few months later i sent the tape off to charity i didn't want to see it again br br sorry but if you're thinking of watching a movie and then nodding off to sleep i can highly recommend it you me i'll rather go on pro plus and watch something decent br br disappointing 1 out of 10
<START> even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan i found this film to be beyond awful it was a huge disappointment since it was featured as one of the eight horrorfest films i can only hope the other seven were better i was actually embarrassed for the friends i was able to convince to see this and these are the same friends i made watch the remake of the wicker man it has every clichÃ© in the book in fact it went out of its way to include them let's start with the characters instead of one young damsel in distress we get three the single hot mom with two a blossoming yet brainless teenager and a cute yet simultaneously creepy little girl that you just know is going to have 'special' skills including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead the little girl is the same one that was in the remake of the amityville horror she was a little annoying but not nearly as irritating dakota fanning br br overall these characters seemed like escapees from a lifetime movie i thought perhaps horror movies had moved on from scenes where the female characters go to bed in full makeup and run around in the dark announcing their presence to anyone with ears but not this one i also find it inconceivable that none of them could be bothered to secure the front door from arbitrarily opening day and night to give you an idea about how uninvolved i was with these characters i spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must have been on the set because everyone was in a coat even in their houses and how white their teeth were br br despite all the formulaic plot machinations the film does not build any suspense at all except to wonder when it will be over there is more atmosphere at the local giant in the middle of the most mundane of weekday afternoons as for the dialogue i could have sampled quotes from ten other films and cobbled together better more believable discourse the gore level the eye candy for a horror fan was minimal at best without their tiny weapons the 'zombies' were not menacing at all you could probably drop kick a couple of them across the room br br what really kills it is its banality horror films more than any other genre cannot survive uninspired mediocrity give me a horror movie that is comically inept or outrageously over the top with gore i can even take the new ones with their cringe inducing torture every once in a while i'd appreciate a truly frightening one anything but this
<START> be warned of possible spoilers br br a friend told me to check out this series and i'm glad i took her words for it br br i read the synopsis on the dvd cover and i was immediately intrigued the main protagonist is muslim no way this is a first it's about an fbi agent who is under deep cover to penetrate a possible sleeper cell in la and get this he is a practicing muslim i was a little skeptical at first half expecting some hero or the antagonist to spout maybe silly gratuitous and mindless holier than thou fanatic let's face it a lot of shows have been guilty of this br br but then i watched the first three episodes and i thought okay this is good it wasn't until episode four scholar when i was well and truly impressed i would like to commend on the great writing and also superb performances from the actors i just love how complex every one of these characters they're not straight out two dimensional cardboard cutout good guys bad guys michael gives a wonderful and believable performance as the muslim fbi agent al treading the fine line between being the good muslim and being a man with flaws gives his character an interesting depth is not the typical oily middle eastern stereotype but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and doesn't see himself as a fanatic but a man willing to do whatever extreme measures to justify his beliefs he's very charismatic and authoritative but i would say that it was alex performance that clearly left an impression in me in scholar his portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was amazing torn between the softly spoken words of a muslim scholar encouraging him to return to the non aggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in god's eye and persuasion to believe otherwise br br i'm looking forward to watch more shows like this and not some ridiculously high octane one man show series it's clever and open minded
<START> i don't like boxing don't understand the attraction i did like this movie positive portrayals of latinos with no drugs sex or street violence the plot actually showed stable loving families the fight sequences are violent as is boxing but not as over the top as rocky films nothing wrong with attempting familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity it's a good rent
<START> late one night on tom snyder's tomorrow show i watched tom ask his guest henry morgan what he considered to be 'perfect ' morgan responded anything with glenda jackson and although i wouldn't consider this film to be perfect it does bear out that notion very well i was about to use the clichÃ©' about hollywood not making pictures like this anymore but then i just saw up in the air another intelligent film about 2 people over the age of 35 who fall in love that's where the similarities end though house calls is just sheer fun watching 2 pros like matthau and jackson hit it off and seem completely natural while they're at it i saw this film in the theater in 1978 at the ripe old age of 18 and it took me another 20 years to get all of the jokes any film that can make punch lines out of 1920's tennis great bill and british prime minister neville chamberlain wouldn't play too well at the megaplex these days one other thought the original theatrical release featured a on the beach fall in love' montage set to the beatles george harrison tune something it seemed a bit forced at the time but that song has since been swapped out for a rather generic henry mancini music cue for subsequent home video and cable release too bad because that scene just lays there now another victim of music licensing hell
<START> i saw this film early one morning in the early 90s when i was about 12 i have been trying to find what it was and finally today i did i remember enjoying it and being a little bit freaked out at the ending when it showed the gravestone of the young boy and his ghostly face please could anybody let me no if i can get a copy of this as i would love to see it again i remember the kid getting stuck down a cornish tin mine and then befriending a boy cant remember that the kids were stuck there with miners but must have been the boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who had died while working down there i think
<START> i've felt that rupert has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him so even though i had never heard of this film before when it appeared in my cable tv listings i immediately switched to that channel i am so happy that i did br br i've read from other reviewers that they don't generally like coming of age stories i on the other hand quite do i am one of those who is always coming of age i have been since i was 12 i'm 52 now and i will probably continue until i'm 92 coming of age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day brings the suddenness of the realization the magnitude of it sometimes throws us into disarray if we try to shelter our delicate selves from that then yes i can see how the coming of age can end but if we simply dust ourselves off and settle into the new direction we've discovered then we're all of a sudden on a new path and we're just as alive as we were yesterday only stronger brighter and i daresay more interesting br br so that's what this movie was about this was a coming of age story all the way round young ben his father father robert and certainly dame all went through a marvelous transformation in fact so too did mr didn't he all did i suspect except in fact the mother in spite of her enormous opportunity so to do provided by the events of the end of the film one is left with the feeling that she will continue on exactly the same path she's been on only with perhaps a different supporting cast br br so an excellent film that could not possibly have been made in america which is utterly depressing to think about but thank god we have a steady supply of films made elsewhere that we occasionally get to see i really heartily recommend this film so long as you don't mind cringing through those parts of it that are all too familiar to us all and grinning through all the rest of it
<START> can't grade this very well because i can't say i liked it but it is the story that bothered me not the realization of the film the acting directing atmosphere music were all good it's just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you can't truly relate to the movie ends it is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings don't need to make any sense at all and still be strong but that's about it br br the plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet dylan thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex girlfriend he is married brings his wife and later the kid while the ex knightley marries some other guy but the tension is there dylan is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of ptsd add in some pretty temperamental characters and you have your hands full br br bottom line you have to be in the mood to like this film the hard part is defining this mood i don't think i've ever been in it yet ever so it is probably better watched by adults with a grasp on weird complex human behaviour and maybe a curiosity about dylan thomas
<START> i must admit that i am a fan of cheesy '80's cartoons but this is among the best rainbow and the star stealer is one of the most watchable and entertaining of the rainbow cartoons and is much better than the tv series i especially like the relationship between rainbow and darian and find it very amusing my favorite character though is who is definitely the most magnificent horse in the universe br br i also recommend rainbow new beginnings which tells the story of how came to be have a rainbow day
<START> i appear to be in the minority on this one but i found one true thing to be schmaltzy contrived and generally unpleasant not that the acting was all that bad but the characters seemed little more than archetypes the bad father oh but wait maybe he's not unredeemably bad maybe there can be a resolution at the end admittedly the woman i was with loved the movie so maybe you'll like it but i didn't
<START> the seven ups is a good and engrossing film it's packed with credible performances by scheider and an effective scary performance by richard lynch although most of the characters are card board cut out tough guys character development does not evolve at all on the screen the only thing we know is the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are bad deviating from the crime story norm the seven ups manage to throw scheider and crew into the middle of a building plot in a unique writing twist locations of new york city and an excellent choreographed car chase highlight the film the only downside of the film is the slightly confusing plot line in the beginning they give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are mob related until later in the film had someone blindly started watching the film may be slightly confused on the story otherwise the seven ups is a gritty testosterone filled enjoyable time
<START> the chipmunk adventure br br there are some movies that i could watch all my life and never grow tired of them and this nostalgic favorite is one of them the chipmunk adventure was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation this time on the big screen in an age when disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office the chipmunk adventure stands as one of the best animated films that disney didn't produce in the 80's br br the story is simple and elementary having alvin simon theodore compete in an around the world race with the janette eleanor brittany however as the chipmunks encounter exotic dangers they are unaware that they are the pawns in a major diamond heist br br the chipmunk adventure never was and never will be a film that soars thanks to an engrossing plot and to people who didn't love it as a child the film will probably never be more then an enjoyable yet forgettable animated movie but for me it will always be a little known masterpiece something about the film just clicks for me in a way few films do br br every song is fun upbeat and harmless highlights include the in a slightly risquÃ© arabian dance to calm snakes there's also a very sweet song in which the chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe one thing about the chipmunk characters is that despite the potentially annoying vocals the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating this film is no exception it actually boasts one of the best animated movie soundtracks of the 80's if you ask me br br every joke is cute sincere and amusing the bits between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very amusing and the shock of seeing the nearly forced into marriage by a child emperor is as well the comedy manages to constantly play to the kids so that they don't miss anything but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained br br it's really just a fun trip that is completely humble in it's ambitions the chipmunk adventure never aims to be anything more then it is harmless fun i'll be the first to admit this is a biased review because i have such a nostalgic fondness for the chipmunk adventure that i would never be able to give it a bad review but nonetheless it fills me with such a childish contentment while watching it everyone has their random favorite from childhood that no one knows and for me it's this movie and any film that i can watch over and over whether i am 5 12 23 or older is a great film in my eyes br br a
<START> i've never seen a movie get a worse release then this and that's a shame as this is the funniest film of the year you would think an ad with the line from the director of office space would be enough to warrant a big release but there are no ads no posters no website i doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend what is 20th century fox thinking mike judge's sci fi comedy is set in but it could come true in about 10 years if things continue as they are luke wilson and maya rudolph get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumer zombie inbred retards the film reminds me of woody allen's sleeper robocop planet of the apes blade runner and network and the late great futurama try to see it before fox burns all the prints
<START> a terrific comedy drama about the powers of friendship despite it's a remake of a 1939 film of the same title it would probably be compared to sex and the city i would not compare to it totally the story starts with mary meg ryan who seems to the life most women would envy she's happily married has a good daughter great friends and a great home but perfect life isn't what it seems when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with crystal eve mendes from zach's mary is puzzled and doesn't know what to do but her four good friends sylvia annette bening edie debra messing and alex jada pickett smith try to be there for her in anyway they can i really don't want to give anymore away but i found this enjoyable and i'm a man meg ryan is great it is nice to see her in on the screen again after a series of flops and the rest of the cast are also great including eve mendes as crystal just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy
<START> i saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since i have the dvd it's one of drew barrymore's best works and one that is worth seeing more than once br br not being popular in high school was one f the things in the film i could relate to i wasn't quite as tortured as josie was during her real high school days or like but i was never the go to the major party type either the prom scene were the three popular girls fall victim to their own prank as josie pushes way the intended victim is my favorite scene and i clapped when i first saw it br br i can still watch this movie today it is excellent
