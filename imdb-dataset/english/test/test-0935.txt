<START> just love the interplay between two great characters of stage screen veidt barrymore
<START> air bud 2 golden receiver is a very bad rehearse in making a sequel in the course of a single year the first film was cute cuddly and charming the idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept even the human story had some explanation to it josh's father was killed in a plane crash so he is sad and the audience becomes emotionally involved as well br br now for the poorly made sequel it is terrible this is the worst kind of bad sequel the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones the kind that changes the main plot piece in one way this time the k 9 plays football instead of basketball no madder how much time is spent in mind over matter benefit of a doubt walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making br br the sequel stars kevin zegers as josh who is in eight grade he lives with his mother and little sister in a seattle suburb in the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident which the audience can relate to most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one br br in this movie the emotional plot is a bit more complicated josh's mother is dating once again he and buddy his dog who can play basketball don't like this at all why if i were in his shoes i would love to have an extra parent in my life especially one this nice the man's name is patrick sullivan and josh's mother jackie met him became he is a local veterinarian for buddy br br the animal story is too simple josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team the timber wolves the team itself looks like something from america's funniest home videos the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other so when bud shows up one day he proves he can play as a receiver for them and is no doubt the team's best player br br buddy's extremely cute in his football costume oh he is enough to melt the heart the dog is the best in this movie as well too bad there wasn't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team br br there is a very bad sub plot about russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals of course they try to catch buddy but their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a home alone scenario to them br br air bud 2 golden receiver is much more goofy than the first too the russian kidnappers add a bunch of slapstick that i have to admit made me laugh at the stupidity of it all there are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie to see a dog play football br br the performances were also quite the embarrassment i liked gregory harrison and robert presentations but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a d kevin zegers and cynthia stevenson were absolutely pathetic br br there were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers but that isn't even worth mentioning will children enjoy this movie perhaps but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep they will most certainly complain that the dog didn't get enough screen time in and loath over the fast changing script and protest against the boring performances and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al air bud as i did br br i suppose that they will think the dog is adorable
<START> sure this flick set in eastern europe is filled with sexy but it absolutely has nothing to do with the nicholas cage flick 8mm an ambassador's daughter and her fiancÃ©e mix it up with a local woman in a threesome that ends up being taped the tape is used for blackmail and the stakes get higher and higher as the couple try to work it out themselves instead of going to authorities br br the sex comes and goes and would be the only reason for renting it i suppose if you like this sorta thing and is quite gratuitous towards the middle when we cruise along the porn scene looking for the other woman i definitely question how it got into blockbuster even with a youth restricted sticker considering how just a hint over the edge of soft core it is oh that's right it's the double standard actual art house flicks like the dreamers and y tu mama tambien get castrated r versions but straight to dvd crap like this get the unrated banner proudly attached whatever br br the acting is horrible the plot is mind numbingly unoriginal but really the worst offense is the idea that this is a sequel to 8mm i'd give the flick a d for a grade and be nice but considering they tried to trick me it gets the f it frankly deserves
<START> this is horrible even for a tv movie i can't believe it took three people to write this movie i am not familiar with the novel on which this film was based but it has got to be better than this i'd rather watch a full house marathon than this stupid movie i gave it 2 out of 10 stars only because it was made better by commercials
<START> plot spoilers dr george c scott is the chief of medicine at a major nyc hospital he's left his wife his children have disowned him he's impotent drinks a lot and contemplates suicide also there's a killer roaming the hospital then he meets very strange barbara diana rigg and falls in love she wants him to run away with her but can he completely give up on his old life and start a new one br br very strange movie with an oscar winning script by paddy it presents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors that is run incompetently it manages somehow to actually make this seem pretty funny it's not laugh out loud humor it's very black humor also the acting is right on target scott is just great and oscar nominated here you see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation riggs character is more than a little odd but her matter of fact manner works and she's also incredibly beautiful the script is strong and brutal but never too much i think it fumbles the ball at the end with a situation that goes way too over the top but it's still worth seeing if this had been done totally seriously it probably would be impossible to take also look for katherine in a small bit and stockard channing and christopher guest in uncredited bits i personally had trouble taking this seriously from what i've heard hospitals were this bad back in the 1970s but not anymore see it for the acting and script i give it a 7
<START> this was a really nice surprise i was up late last night and couldn't fall asleep not really thinking twice i turned on my tv and hbo was on and this film was just beginning luckily i saw the whole thing and i am very happy i did because this film was very good the actors were well cast and they did a surprisingly good job kris kristofferson delivered a solid performance there was a lot of substance behind his lines this film made me realize he's a good actor brian keith was great as his father as was trey wilson playing the colonel this was trey wilson's final role before his untimely death too bad he was a quality actor and seemed like a nice guy jobeth williams also did a nice job as kristofferson's american wife as far as the direction i had no idea franklin j schaffner was the director until i read the review in leonard maltin's movie guide this was the last film he ever made now i understand why this movie was so good schaffner also directed patton a truly great movie i haven't seen his other great film papillon while i was watching welcome home i said to myself this director really knows what he's doing not knowing that schaffner had directed it there's one really beautiful scene in a thai orphan refuge enough to bring tears to my eyes not only was this sensitively directed but it was also directed in a very economical and taut way there is nothing wasted in schaffner's effort the script was one reason this film is so good the writer doesn't weigh the actors down with too many lines it was written very simply but very effectively it just shows you that a lot can be said with few words this film also made me proud to be an american at the same time that it showed you how beautiful all people are
<START> you the living 2007 br br mordant i've never written that word before but it comes to mind here let me look it up well it's part of it corrosive but also funny as heck so funny this is a dour film for sure with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor it's impossible not to like it on some level filmed in a very spare style often with a static camera and really balanced stable compositions like theater stages we see a short enactment occur br br but that makes it seem ordinary which it is not ordinary life is shown to be frumpy ironic delightful coy and depressing and impossible we the living must live and since we're alive we may as well take note something like that i think it was ebert who said you find yourself laughing and don't know why exactly and the promo material somewhere said it was a cross between bergman and monty python and what they mean is it has the dry silent probing look of ingmar famous swedish films but it has the zany somehow touching elements of the british comedians br br i'd say definitely definitely watch at least half an hour of this there is part of me that thought i was through by then the rest continues in a similar assemblage of little skits and moments and they do gradually evolve but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind there are some great moments later even just the attention to the thunderstorm which takes us out of the mundane human events nicely br br the filming is gorgeous in its classical control almost like a series of gregory scenes and outdoing the photographer actually and the acting with all its very ordinary non glam is right on a startling beautiful odd experience
<START> i have never seen so much talent and money used to produce anything so bad in my entire life as stated in other commentaries a who's who of talent such as christopher plummer faye dunaway donald sutherland and many more were thrown together in a film that is not recognizable as an agatha christie story i keep thinking of how it could be with the same cast done the right way br br the film has even less intimacy than the christopher reeves 'superman' movies the large cast makes the slick production even less effective than in those films because there is not enough time to get to know anyone dave progressive jazz soundtrack had me wondering if the wrong video was in the the case from the rental store the music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed it's hard to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes was more offensive from someone who has seen most christie films that's what attracted me to this it was one of the few i hadn't seen miss this one it is not an agatha christie movie golan globus are better suited to producing flicks about big time wrestling rather than the snug atmosphere of english mystery
<START> i cannot believe i never added my two cents about this film as yet br br this is one of the best films of all time many critics and movie goers alike talk of john carpenter's halloween for setting trends and being his best work those folks have not seen this version of the thing because it is right up there with halloween br br john carpenter's work shines in this film he took a film that was already made and instead of re making the film he made the book the first film was based on brilliant br br the casting of each man was great the tension between them was real it made me scream made me scared made me guess made me laugh made me question even up to today who goes there in that film this film had no hollywood sweetie pie or funny type ending and what a bold move not to have one in 1982 another brilliant move br br i was at the screening for this film when i was on vacation in southern california the audience at the screening went wild i carry those memories for years it was so much fun we all thought that there was no way on god's green earth this film was not going to be a hit but by box office receipts it was a dud because of et the extra terrestrial and poltergeist two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out br br this film was what i as a horror film adult buff was looking for a horror thriller with an adult script and real adult actors not kids playing adults not little miss big breasted scream queen of the day running around screaming for titilation but real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear heck being a feminist i didn't even miss women in this film and good for mr carpenter by not putting one in there it really wouldn't have made sense unless the thing was actually feminine something to think about br br i saw special effects of that time i had never seen before i saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights this is what horror thrillers of today are missing today the directors wimp out today the studios wimp out too much cgi and not enough belief too much cgi and not enough story not enough imagination you leave the theater and in a week or less you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening this one stays with ya that's one of the marks of an excellent film br br on many reviews i've written how now paying 10 for a film is horrid for films like this one you'd pay it and not feel slighted this film is not for everyone br br i find it horrific that they this film a cult film i find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982 this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad after john carpenter's film many people copied many techniques make up special effects and story lines from this version of the thing br br i am now to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time very much under rated please see it uncut please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally you'll talk about it for years as well
<START> if pulp fiction and get shorty didn't exist this might be an ok film when i say this i mean that nothing from this film is it's own unless it's another bit of terrible dialogue or a clichÃ© full scene all the lines like 'i won't say more than i have to if that' from get shorty seem to appear in this rubbish sequel all the cameos like steven tyler's are acted terribly and are not needed and as for christina man don't get me started sadly some of the coolest actors and actresses like john travolta and uma thurman seem like they are trying to be down with the kids and hip and have nearly ruined there reputation because of this film and frankly i think the best acting is from the rock who plays alongside one of my least favourite actors vince vaughn the man tries to be funny throughout with him taking the mickey of how apparently rappers talk cedric the entertainer and andre 3000 play another terrible double act i personally think the background actors were better than cedric and andre and the only funny part of the acting of cedric andre and the rest of there gang do is the way there trousers are down to there knees so you can clearly see there boxers and the only reason i find this funny is because lots of people actually do that so in conclusion this film tries to be funny and fails miserably it doesn't have any new material comedy or coolness throughout as it copies every other film and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is to it's brilliant predecessor get shorty oh yes i forgot to mention there is a big clichÃ© at the end
<START> in the early 19th century a young woman with a falls foul of her family's ambition and the superstitions of the local community but she meets a man who may see her differently and just may change life forever br br precious bane is a british broadcasting corporation adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by mary webb it's a beautifully filmed piece that is acted to an incredibly high standard the story screenplay by maggie is excellent and the period detail and use of dialect is second to none it's such a shame that this film has yet to get a dvd release one would have thought that with clive owen's great here as gideon rise to stardom the bbc would get it out there but sadly no so the only way of catching it is on the very rare occasions that tcm shows it the lead performance from janet mcteer as is simply brilliant guts and genuine emotion go hand in hand as mcteer gives it her all has to not only contend with her facial disfigurement but also the constant and hurt from the ignorant villagers this is a time when folk believed that if a hare ran in front of a pregnant woman it spelt doom a time of bull baiting a time of superstitions and talk of witches in spite of constant set backs is strong and resourceful even her own family knock her dreams back without realising it but this road may well be a terribly bumpy one but hope is everlasting and has hope in abundance br br 8 5 10
<START> it is the best movie on acting i have ever seen all the artists are old turkish theater actors they are magnificent in this movie it is sometimes said that they do not act they live it you can really see this in this movie the director is also competent you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good but after the acting the most outstanding part is the content of the movie it gives happiness enthusiasm desire to live importance of real friends to people we all started to live individually nowadays in this film you see that there are someone other then us and most importantly you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love loving your friends loving your darling all people should see this movie
<START> i am testing myself to watch 3 bad movies in a row to find out if watching 3 bad movies in a row could give me amnesia i have a dubbed to english version of this movie now let me go down the points music score bad quality but at least it suits story it's about a guy who goes to a town and he meets his sheriff brother and they fight for farmers land from a major and he allies with mexicans to drive them out and trinity and his brother try to teach them to defend it the final climatic fight scene will confuse anyone about who the are the good guys conclusion better than i thought but i need to continue with this i am next going to watch the dolph lungren and jean vanne damme movie universal soldier pray for my sanity
<START> i never expected such an old film to be as impressive as this 1930 western turned out to be the scenes of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons encountering storms and mud river crossings indian attacks and every manner of trial and danger are astonishing in their rugged believability much of the film was shot outdoors and the movie has a truly epic feel about it the actors must have experienced much the same conditions as the original pioneers did and the results are astounding the wagons the clothing every single detail looks and feels right the characters are simple but believable with a straightforward story that travels like the wagon train to its destination br br john wayne is slim and youthful in one of his first roles as the scout leading the wagons and he does a fine job as the idealistic young frontiersman he's up against a marvelously trio of villains including ian keith as a slick gambler charles stevens as a mexican sidekick and tyrone power senior as the bear like trapper power's bearded snarling larger than life portrayal is both comic and menacing i keep picturing him with a gold hoop earring and black eye patch with a parrot on his shoulder as he grunts and growls various threats and insults his character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship with no difficulty at all he nearly steals the whole picture br br tully marshall is delightful as a wily old frontiersman who is wayne's best friend the lovely marguerite churchill makes a spirited heroine whose initial meeting with wayne is a hilarious mix up resulting in a long running courtship consisting of insults and feigned indifference on her part to aw shucks persistence on his the results are quite humorous and one is glad to see them finally get together at the end br br the scenery is amazing with the wagons crossing real prairies and having to be lowered by ropes down cliffs indians who are clearly the genuine article and not white actors in makeup appear as both friends and foes and are treated with dignity wayne's character tells an admiring group of young boys that the indians are his friends who taught him everything he knows about survival in the wilderness br br the big trail is an uncomplicated tale told well by a talented cast and crew it will probably appear naive to many modern viewers but there is a quiet dignity about it that never lets it become corny there is a great deal of intentional humor including a rowdy rascal of a pioneer who makes loud animal sounds from hiding every time the smooth gambler ian keith tries to con the beautiful heroine into marrying him his flowery speeches about the plantation he allegedly owns are interrupted by very realistic imitations of yowling cats and quacking ducks causing the would be seducer to look around in annoyance for the unseen creatures br br highly recommended both for western fans and lovers of old movies in general this is truly a classic film for the ages
<START> after hoo american indians scalp number one son frontiersman bruce bennett as daniel boone seems at first like he wants to get even but he really wants to make friends with the natives when sad eyed indian chief lon chaney jr as also loses number one son it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings apparently this was republic pictures' attempt to do for their daniel boone trail blazer what disney studio's had successfully done with davy crockett king of the wild frontier 1955 br br the dan'l boone song whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon did not follow fess parker's davy crockett up the hit parade singer young as doesn't perform the title song perhaps wisely he does sing long green valley and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for boone's daughter but spanish actor freddy fernandez is the film's most valuable player in a cute scene mr fernandez reminds mr young the name of the character susannah he is supposed to be in love with br br daniel boone trail blazer 10 5 56 ismael rodrÃ­guez bruce bennett lon chaney jr young freddy fernandez
