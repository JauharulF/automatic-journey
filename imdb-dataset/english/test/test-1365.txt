<START> warning spoilers dear roger br br during your distinguished career you've made a wide range of entertainment some good some night of the blood beast falls in the latter category it's not as awful as say the phantom from 10 000 leagues or maybe the dunwich horror nonetheless one of my greatest criticisms of this movie is that i could have made it for you faster better and cheaper br br let's start with the and titles roger the rocket sequences look like something from disney's man into space not as good of course the futuristic looks like nothing in contemporary 1958 why didn't you just use a vanguard atlas or even a viking launch better still why not dispense entirely with the launch and start with a shot of space and the capsule floating in it that's what i would have done for you roger second why have the spaceship crash upon even a middle school physics student could have told you your astronaut would have arrived on earth extra crispy and largely i would have shown your astronaut becoming possessed by the monster maybe by using that great negative positive stuff you used in war of the satellites losing contact with earth and landing in the wilderness that would also explain how you blood beast could impregnate your astronaut during the tremendous heat of but still be destroyed by fire even with these stupidities the first half of your movie is pretty good had you spent some money on decent music it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of outer limits but once again your writer describes ed nelson as the designer of the landing system then gives him some stupid dialogue regarding magnetism the biggest problem with the second half of night of the blood beast is michael he's terrible as the doomed astronaut you should have fired him on the spot and replaced him with ed nelson you could have combined nelson's responsibilities with those of john and saved yourself the cost of one actor i don't know if you actually paid any of these people but at least you would saved the cost of catering three meals a day i'd had also ditched the scorched parrot costume and spent the extra money using makeup to have the astronaut turn into the blood beast maybe that was a little too close to the creeping unknown for you but it would have helped the pace of the second half immensely if you are going to have a blood beast wouldn't it be a good idea to show a little blood yeah i know the title comes from the embryos in the astronaut's blood but kowalski could've done a lot better job for you if he poured a little chocolate syrup around after all it looks like blood in black and white what've that cost you maybe two bucks i'd have also used some closeups for some reason insipid dialogue and bad acting don't seem quite so bad in closeups look at almost 70s tv series and you'll see what i mean oh in closing roger a note to your writer you can't use a to show some poor schmuck full of alien embryos when you don't have any electricity remember you fried the generator in the first reel oh and i almost forgot roger couldn't you afford a fake knife you know the kind where the blade goes into the handle i had one of those when i was 9 which also happens to be the year night of the blood beast was made it cost maybe another two bucks i think i knew enough then to make you a better movie i know i know enough now to do so so roger if you decide to remake night of the blood beast or if you are looking for a writer director to work with you on some other project i'm your man i'll work cheap 'cause i'd really like to make a movie for you roger br br i give night of the blood beast a 3 special note if you like to watch kitschy movies like night of the blood beast the dvd i bought for 3 99 was very good quality you can also get night of the blood beast along with a lot of other terrible horror scifi movies at places like for about 6
<START> i can't express enough just how bad this film was first of all what a waste of some legendary stars although they are quite old and pretty unconvincing fred astaire well i guess he must have owed some one a big favor as this was his last film role the script is a mess and the film seems terribly draggy i imagine maybe if i saw this back when it came out 1981 i might have thought it was decent however seeing so many actual good horror films this was one of the worst the only real convincing anything in this mess was the very young and lovely sort of creepy alice krige the main young character was trying to act the best he could but was utterly terrible i wasn't sure how much of it was from his lack of skill or the lack of a comprehend able script but either way he was just plain bad don't watch unless you want to see a bunch of old guys be somewhat scared
<START> considered by many to be a strangely overlooked chabrol it seems to me the reason it has been cold shouldered is its sleaze factor not as overtly sexy violent or gory as many films of this period it nevertheless starts rather startlingly and although becoming more measured continues to ooze a rather unpleasant ms not here the ice maiden but a drunken mother donald pleasence does a cameo as a child molester david hemmings has his eyes on underage sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother sister and niece no not very nice at all and chabrol treats it all as if it is very normal like it might be in some small french village instead of ed mcbain's new york city had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film here we really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant options before the final denouement very watchable
<START> after 10 viewings in 20 years i too think this was the crazy gang's best effort on film with more cohesion in the plot than their next best button afloat they were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage sometimes in front of royalty until allen retired in the '40's through ill health he outlived them all by years apparently they were just as mad outside work regularly playing practical jokes on one another br br the six wonder boys troupe head for i'll get her to tell me alaska to dig for the gold that was being found there it seemed a better idea than going to mansfield because they'd been there when they get to red gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper they'd read tasted funny but by then it doesn't matter as they've all fallen in love with snow white and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold baddie bill m wants it himself however br br the number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing but most of them will probably only make sense to brits and ex pats interested in seeing '30's british b w comedies imho nearly all of the gags and routines work including the gold if patter between bud and the whistle while you work pastiche even the always getting our man mountie inserts a marvellous little film in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended
<START> the most worthless film of the decade the responsible parties should never be allowed to film again i have no words to describe the lack of entertainment this film provides you couldn't pay me to watch this film again quite honestly i think i would be a better person had i not seen it if i called it offensive i would fall into a category of emotionally frail extremists i would say this film goes so far as to damage the industry there are films that i refuse to watch now that i feel they might be this tasteless i feel like an idiot that i didn't have the good sense to walk out during any one of many moments i was compelled to do so yes i saw the end and am ashamed for it as should anyone else including the writer i am in awe
<START> irwin allen put all his talents behind this one he's co screenwriter producer and director of this cartoonish epic about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the earth potentially exciting story fails to take off despite an eclectic cast varied players from walter pigeon and joan fontaine to frankie avalon and barbara eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color but this soggy sci fi is pretty cheesy good for a few stray laughs but allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong solid adventure and campy nonsense later a popular tv series from
<START> i don't understand why critics would bash this movie it's a teen movie that's actually serious which is a rarity i'll admit that there are moments that are hugely sappy but c'mon it's about young love it's gotta be sappy to be valid my biggest complaint is chris klein while he was funny in american pie he apparently isn't ready for the switch into more dramatic fare yet he's very uncomfortable looking in some of his mama stuff hartnett and sobieski on the other hand demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and believability as do the parent's although the script is heavily cliched with the lovers spouting off poetry the actor's make it work the directing sports some powerful images on the screen beautiful cinematography nice music great young actors i was impressed and i'm a jaded critic when it comes to teen movies
<START> i have 2 complete sets from time life this is my favorite movies of all time love all the actors and actresses awsome picture love patrick this is the film that showed his true talent but yet he does not get credit for the display he preformed much credit has been missed in these films love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty of the civil war making it into one of the greatest love stories of all time and showing through all of life what true freindship means how 2 divided countries split but yet all and all the freindship remained solid even though the war divided and up but through it all till the very end they remained and taught us the viewer how true ships can still remain till present day simply the best gone with the wind doesn't compare to this film patrick at his best after seeing this movie for the one hundred thousand time i became a big fan of and have followed his career ever since have all his movies after he made north and south
<START> so i turned on the tv today at 1 00 pm on a sunday expecting to see crap and infomercials and this great movie was just starting didn't know what it was but drew me in almost immediately the movie was excellent br br there were a couple of things that didn't make sense for one i don't get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation but then jimmy doesn't really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation in other words it wasn't his initiative that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck second i don't get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end because the whole thing was partly by the thief people stealing money and then the other thief kills panda at the end so they steal his money twice and kill him how is that good
<START> betty is an for the lead in a production of verdi's macbeth when a car mysteriously hits the lead betty is thrust into the spotlight opening night is a smashing success and betty decides to leave the after party to celebrate in private with her boyfriend but when the boyfriend leaves the room betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown black gloved masked figure the unknown assailant ties betty to a column gags her and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain should betty close them the boyfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see betty in such a predicament he's even more shocked when the killer grabs him and shoves a knife through his lower jaw with such force the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth and betty has been forced to watch all of this so begins betty's terrifying ordeal with a killer not just intent on hurting her but also on forcing her to watch as he mutilates her friends br br opera gets classified as a giallo but to me it differs in quite a few ways from the model less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of the story than in something like argento's tenebre or the bird with the crystal plumage the black gloved masked killer may be omnipresent but the clues and red herrings normally associated with a good giallo are absent instead opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience uncomfortable the focus is on the grisly death scenes betty's fear and the killer's obsession with betty br br opera features what i think are some of argento most artistic death scenes when the killer grabs betty after her boyfriend leaves the room you're sure that betty's had it but the sadistic killer only wants to force betty to watch as he brutally stabs her lover in the neck Â the knife emerging in his mouth it's a well shot and designed scene and those needles in the eyes Â brilliant or take the death of the seamstress at first her death seems like an ordinary run of the mill murder but when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killer's what started out as just another death scene turns it up a notch as the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girl's throat open to get his chain finally there's the most famous death scene in opera that i'm amazed with each time i see it Â mira is shot in the eye while peering through a keyhole that scene displays a lot of what i like about argento it's got style to burn as implausible as it may be it's creative memorable and a blast to watch br br argento certainly wasn't the first italian director to concentrate on eye mutilation but in opera he's taken eye trauma to a new level needles holding eyes open a bullet in the eye and ravens pecking out an eye are all part of argento's vision pun intended and these scenes do have the effect that i believe argento was going for the first time i saw the killer putting those needles in betty's eyes i couldn't stop blinking it actually had a physical effect on me what is it about the eyes that make them such a target for abuse in italian films br br to be fair and not sound like such a fanboy there are problems i have with opera that keep me from rating it as argento's best one of my problems is with the air duct system running through betty's apartment building while i don't doubt there are air duct systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments the ducts in opera are huge i'm no expert but i sincerely doubt any building like the one in this movie would have had such mammoth air ducts it doesn't seem practical at all and don't you think someone would have done something about them long ago to keep criminals and nosey neighbors out of the other apartments it's convenient for the plot but it's not very realistic br br but i suppose my major problem with the film comes with the finale what's up with that ending it feels totally out of place tacked on and like a bad afterthought i'm not sure what else to say other than it's horrible
<START> this movie is kind of good it seem that they used the tyrannosaurus rex like a blown up balloon just like godzilla just maybe back in those 60 70's days scientist haven't got enough info on all sorts of dinosaurs back in those time scientist still making dinosaur so i guess this movie was base on a tyrannosaurus rex movements back in the 60 70's there even a part where a giant rock fired by someone at the tyrannosaurus rex it damage the tyrannosaurus rex and it was knock out for a little while at the end the tyrannosaurus rex went back to search for food there is something wrong in the movie as well like a rifle how can one rifle kill a tyrannosaurus rex when it could be 1 000 5 000 stronger than we are if this film going to make a remake i suggest make it more good and excited because watching a old movie seems like to have a remake of it if lucky
<START> lucio fulci was one of the most prolific italian directors by the time of his death in 1996 yet his career had long since descended into a downward spiral of increasingly futile genre entries that could barely stand in the shadow of his earlier work for much of the '70s into the mid '80s he cranked out such stylistically distinctive horrors as city of the living dead the beyond and the brutal giallo the new york ripper fondly remembered by fans like myself and while cat in the brain falls in with the era of fulci's decline as a filmmaker it is a shocking darkly hilarious that while a clearly inferior work the framing effects and acting are below par proves an interesting open ended meditation on pop psychology and film's ability to make no mistake cat in the brain is a total gorefest and as disjointed as fulci's previous films but it deserves credit for trying to be something more in a deliciously tongue in cheek touch fulci plays himself a director in the midst of filming yet another violent horror flick who comes down with perverse murderous hallucinations after visiting a shrink who puts him under hypnosis his dreams and reality begin to intersect to the point where the viewer cannot discern the two the recent dvd from grindhouse releasing mentions cat as an heir apparent to the likes of eraserhead and it does carry a similarly disquieting awkwardly funny quality associated with the best surrealist art
<START> dracula 3000 or van helsing dracula's revenge cheap cash in on another lame vampire flick as i saw it is a master class in how not to make a movie a rag tag collection of misfit board a previously lost cargo ship the in the cough carpathian system which later is upgraded to the carpathian galaxy and awake a relentless evil in this case the script the film is a bizarre bastardization of event horizon and whatever the lamest vampire film of all time is br br spoliers follow after a plethora of production company logos and a credit sequence that most of the budget must have been blown on we open with a cheesy exposition type speech from casper silly name who plays captain abraham van helsing sillier name and in lieu of actual character development goes on to describe the twisted unintelligible oddities that make up his crew van helsing himself sports a spray on stubble and wears a body warmer throughout in a sort of retro 80's tribute to han solo i guess now and again the captain of the pops up in some sort of mad video diary to tell us nothing of consequence in a pronounced german accent subtitles sadly not included crewmember mina boards the derelict ship alone armed only with a gun shaped torch and thick east european accent while conversing with van helsing on his ships bridge which is basically a single glittery wall mina wearing a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front encounters what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cloak who continually glides by the camera why this happens as the vampire is not yet made flesh is never explained this leads on to a shaky camera chasing mina down the hallways until she runs into humvee it's possible will smith could have been drafted in to write lines as most of them consist of humvee reminding us he is black every ten seconds and saying the word ass enough for a guinness book of records entry while delivering all this in a from da hood accent this is the year 3000 does da hood even exist one of the main problems with this film is that it insanely tries to pretend its set in the year 3000 unfortunately anyone with healthy eyes won't buy this as the looks suspiciously like a soviet style ocean going tanker possibly the film crew thought it would be okay to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy poster of lenin next to a bunch of lockers and explain it away as some sort of futuristic communist comeback special the crew's clothes look as if they were raided from a collection box sealed since 1993 and they are armed to the teeth with latest in 20th century automatic weapons with added year 3000 zing when fired which of course are absolutely no use against vampires is a thing of the past in the future as the simpering professor not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair my god what happened to all that genetic engineering stuff br br the professor is an interesting character as he is a direct rip off from alien resurrection who had their own rag tag misfit crew with a guy in a wheelchair who oddly wasn't killed fans didn't take to prof as he appears scared in a lot of scenes if i were entombed in a non wheelchair access soviet ship pursued by bad acting vampires and everyone left me because i was such a whining wimp i'd be scared too br br during the un dramatic mina chase scene the prof informs us with feeling this is disconcerting the rest of his lines are also disconcerting bugger and we're all going to die x 100 follows br br erika eleniak appears as the vice captain what happened to 1st officers in what i thought would be the tired standard issue hard nosed no nonsense don't eye me up unless i tell you too beat up 10 stuntman at one time super babe but this is a z flick so she basically wears a tight low cut top and even tighter leather trousers coolio's performance boosts the ham factor by 90 and is camper than a row of tents but luckily for us he dies soon enough although he seems to keep his heart on the right hand side of his body br br after a lot of running up and down the same corridor using clunky soviet style controls and sitting in soviet style locker rooms the crew find themselves stranded as their own ship off to find a more interesting crew probably why dracula is even mentioned is unknown as the main bad guy is called which is space transylvanian for crimes against fashion as he dandies about in a big puffy frilly shirt and even bigger starched collar making hammer horror vampires look slick by comparison stops to explain his entire back story off camera to erica eleniak but fails to kill her in another rip off twist from alien resurrection his back story is such a load of mince it's not worth repeating as the budget can't afford fight coordinators special effects original music script not written by a chimpanzee and even proper end titles the first cast list i saw were same characters but completely different and italian names the film begins to destroy whatever sanity you began with the crew luckily are able to fight back with the help of a ships computer that contains obscure millennium old references on how to kill fictional creatures and some handy 20th century pool cues they find in the ship recreation room up yours holodeck the ending is awful and a little suspect either they ran out of money or the ex soviets demanded their ship back i walked into this film knowing it was bad but oblivious as to how bad it really was
<START> what a surprise a basic copycat of the comedy classic 'the nutty professor' only naughtier funny guy tim thomerson who steals the show as in robin hood men in tights is downright hilarious as the anal retentive dr jekyll and the sex crazed hyde br br the one scene that is really funny is when dr mark blankfield catches jekyll in bed with his daughter and says br br how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter br br jekyll replies but sir i'm going ahead with the operation br br replies back oh well in that case fu your brains out
<START> i am a happily married 49 year old female who just happens to love this movie to death br br geena davis' character is strong smart and kick ass i thought she did an excellent thats an understatement job in this movie br br i'm not real big on action movies but i thought it was sooooooooooo sexy and entertaining br br she is my alter ego when she starts putting that assault rifle together in the old hotel room i got chills she did it like she knew what she was doing thats one of my many favorite parts in that movie br br i think she deserved an oscar for her acting and physical roles br br i'm going to have on my back i'm one of those girls who will never be a victim i'm like her secretly and isn't that oh so sexy
