<START> we have a character named just wants to be a good person she's nice friendly smiles often but is strangely brutally honest also has a secret her idiot savant sister has been reciting original poetry which is getting the community excited about the sister writing unfortunately it's poetry while their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in just tries to figure out what she really wants to do br br what to keep in mind while watching this movie is who really is for such a brutally honest person who doesn't mind telling ivy league types that she doesn't respect them it would seem odd that she would be able to pull off a lie for someone so happy and cheerful she's quite emotionless when it comes to certain issues those aren't character flaws they're plot development and they mean a lot more than they at first seem br br mostly this is something of a melodrama a character lies the other characters' personalities propel them through drama as relationships are held at risk but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiot savant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch br br the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good they're acceptable and world is wreathed in color and light which makes for some very beautiful images but it's not very consistent it's not really so much of a flaw as a result of a low production value but within that same value is some genuine storytelling and a real care for the characters so while it isn't a perfect movie it's certainly an enjoyable one br br polarisdib
<START> i really enjoyed this movie in my dvd collection of baseball movies reminded me how great the sport truly is whether it's here in america or japan
<START> i was looking forward to seeing this movie unfortunately i should have listened to my daughters advice this should have been a spoof but it took on a realism that corporations had a lot to answer for br br jim carrey after all the work he has done is still jim carrey and his comedy does not get any better his co star was not able to back him up their son in the movie was invisible br br the life of crime was a blink and that was the missing link of the movie the film showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before that where it lost it for me br br i did laugh in some parts the whole not good enough i felt was there to add some weight to the film his character was not strong enough there were just too many gaps to make this a smart and tight movie
<START> this movie was disturbing not because of the subject matter but because of the way it was handled the extremely overweight mother angela did not even make it on the cover of the video case when most of the rest of the cast did this is not fair but is a statement in itself i also notice her picture is missing from imdb maybe her own choice and it looks like this is her only film ever the language in this movie was crude beyond necessity watched with my 10yr old son because it was rated pg in canada and the language coming out of their mouths was shameful disgusting never did appreciate shirley like so many others seem to br br love kathy bates and always will part was annoying br br the little boy alex is a great little actor i'll have to see what else he's been up to lately
<START> this film tops the previous incarnation by a mile taking everything to the next level as always the jackass guys are purely unbelievable and i personally laughed harder in that theatre than i have in a long time like the first jackass this isn't so much a movie as an eighty minute long string of stunts and pranks it is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level essentially these guys are clowns themselves for the amusement of others and its great the shenanigans are so low outrageous and often disgusting that they transcend into a higher form of entertainment br br you can't rate this along other movies its in a class of its own and it shines go and enjoy it for the pure spectacle that it is
<START> this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it is about true love and friendship about turning your life around and doing something good for someone else thomas bo larsen may play the same role he has done in so many other movies but recently we have seen him in other roles which he does great too but so what if he plays the same role that he has done in other movies Â he's perfect for that role ulrich thomsen does a great job too these two criminal low lifes are the best friends ever they share everything and they do everything for each other no matter what the costs are when they find out that peter's daughter is being abused they put everything on hold things you can't put on hold unless you have to make even more criminal acts and takes her to a better place they do the best they can Â these two men are not masterminds but they have their heart in the right place all i can say is that peter and are my biggest heroes tooÂ
<START> well don't expect anything deep an meaningful most of the fight scenes are pretty decent the two leading ladies are quite endearing but their lack of hk action background shows at times the ending maybe lacks something but i quite enjoyed it none the less the cheesy humour isn't probably going to appeal to anyone who hasn't watched a bunch of hk films but if your down with that sort of thing and have a couple of hours to fill with something meaningless you could do a lot worse than this ok so you could do better but br br certainly on a par with most of the hollywood blockbuster action drivel br br 7 10
<START> great underrated movie great action good actors and a wonderful story line wesley is verry good and the villain the bad guy is wonderful the girl plays a nice role and the comedy mixed with
<START> this movie obviously had good intentions at the end there is a dedication to someone named kellie who as a viewer i can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts perhaps she made the wrong choice that dedication is the only redeeming quality of love suicide br br the movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film it's pretty much going to be downhill after that which it was i know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good unfortunately everything else was horrid the acting the plot the sound quality the picture quality the acting i'm sorry but the acting is horrible beyond horrible it's as if the actors are trying to act like people acting that's the only way i can think to describe it as i watched i actually pictured the script with the stage direction in my mind none of the movements were natural and none of the characters' reactions to one another fit in short the timing is way off the timing of the entire film is way off i'm no director so i know the limits of my knowledge but i really feel there had to be some way to convey the passing of time until they explained about graduation not being too far away i was under the impression that the first portion of the movie had taken place over the span of a week a month at most br br all that being said it's really a shame this movie truly could have been powerful with a little tweaking all the moments in the film in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious but only because the set up is obvious which is a bad thing the moving scenes totally fell flat for instance when kaye's brother takes his hat of his head and puts it on hers we should feel the understanding he has for her the innocence and of the love of her brother somehow it just doesn't come off that way there are so many more scenes like this for example all of the fight scenes and all they do is take away from the movie all these things put together love suicide comes off as one long cheesy low budget commercial
<START> during wwii there were a bazillion movies created by hollywood and after seeing many of them they start to seem alike however over 21 is unique in so many ways as it shows a side of the war you won't see in other films making it well worth seeing even if you have seen the bazillion other films br br alexander knox plays the male lead but the real lead of the film is irene dunne who looks amazing for a 47 year old lady yes i checked she really was this old when she made the film in over 21 the pair play husband and wife he enlists in the military much to the consternation of his father charles coburn and owner of the newspaper where knox is employed and most of the film takes place when he is in officers candidate school the film shows little of knox in the school but instead centers on dunne as she lives in nearby spartan housing for spouses during this time she as the british say keeps a upper and makes the best of it even though she really isn't a housewife but a famous professional writer occasionally she gets very brief visits from her harried husband but most of the time is spent doing housewife duties and keeping the meddling coburn at bay eventually she decides to stop the pesky coburn from phoning incessantly he always complains that his paper won't survive without his son by pretending to be knox writing wonderful that everyone just assumes were written by him br br while there is nothing earth shaking in this film it's a very interesting slice of life move additionally the acting all around is very good it's interesting that this film is a fictionalized reworking of the experienced of ruth gordon a famous screenwriter and her husband garson kanin also a famous screenwriter as well as director when kanin joined the military during wwii gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became this film br br by the way i noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech towards the end of the film and were inspired by it while it was very good it was also very sad as all this hope for a better world following the war was short lived
<START> this was one of my favorite movies from childhood i watched it so many times eventually my tape wore out i was a huge fan of this show and still am the thing i love most about this movie is that it appeals to so many people both young and old i watch this movie now and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw it i am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes that i never got as a child my favorite characters are and almost fifteen years later my dad a huge fan of the movie as well and i are still quoting lines from this movie i love the part where and shirley go to the movies you save the seats shirl and i'll snag the snacks i also loved the storyline of plucky and hampton and his family going to happy world land wade pig reminded me a lot of my dad i love the part when they finally get to happy world land and all they do is ride on the monorail this movie is hilarious and appeals to children and kids the animation jokes and everything about it are top notch if you have not seen it rent it you won't be sorry
<START> another nice entry in the crime doctor series 4 10 with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid spanish american backdrops and sets and a more off the wall storyline too br br a man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party the crime doctor is on the scene ostensibly as a guest to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over for one of them did the deed was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife the 3rd wife and rich widow hilary brooke the dancing brother and sister vampires the intense young man the eccentric cabinet maker lloyd corrigan on loan from boston blackie the irreplaceable butler or odds on jerome cowan police inspector emory parnell had his work cut out but warner baxter as was as unflappable as ever in working it all out one of the goofs listed on the imdb is wrong on breaking into the murder room says right through the centre of the forehead and cowan replies he didn't miss this time favorite bits baxter and cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party the scene where the place of repose is seemingly rumbled the plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of monogram but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldn't do either br br well worth a watch if you already like the genre you won't be disappointed unless you really don't like the genre
<START> spoiler warning br br i got this dino on dvd at christmas 2004 i had longed to see it and was by no means disappointed the score is memorable my br br favourites were the theme song and the winters coming song the effects were dazzling you could almost believe they were there you actually learn something too may have been able to pump their plates with blood female t rexes might have gone on a killing spree before laying their eggs i know there's a lot of people who thought this was based too much on speculation but there will always be questions that we can only guess at and there is a lot of hard core undeniable fact as well we know that some dinosaurs travelled in herds we know that swallowed stones to grind up vegetation in their stomaches despite this speculation the series did extremely well so well in fact that it spawned a followup a prequel and several specials if you're a dino fan then this is for you it makes jurassic park look small and weedy
<START> anna success with' head on' now begins to look like it depended totally on the script and alex dimitriades great lead performance the degree to which this latest the book of revelation is both derivative pretentious and utterly unoriginal except for tristan fine cinematography seems to bear this out br br alas there have already been quite a few aussie movies dealing with such themes some reviled for and or explicit sex scenes in the 1970s and 1980s and beyond and maybe they're worth looking at again after this piece of fluff of course setting the whole thing in the world of ballet and making it all achingly slow and in its choreography like a 1960s dutch ballet experimental number does suggest great art if you've not traveled around much and then only if you never progressed beyond art theory 101 br br add to the pretension appallingly arch dialog you will do as we command and the whole shebang falls onto its well funded face then there are the bits straight from dario argento br br given the lovely but truncated performance by colin friels how about a real city primeval thriller br br all in all with 'the book of the feminist project has been set back yet another decade and with the willing and deeply of male writers like henry miller william burroughs even bukowski collaboration of some collective in melbourne oz suffering from a form of educational and ideological amnesia no revelations await us here
<START> i am so glad zac was in 'the suite life of zack and because that is my favorite show and he is my favorite actor it is a really funny episode and a funny show i love everything about the show and the characters all of the performers are great keep on acting zac and i am so happy that nearly all of my favorite actors including high school musical characters are in this show zac is so 'hot' and i have an autographed picture of him it is not a photo copy and it came all the way from america to australia and it nearly did not arrive in time for christmas also i got a high school musical mug with my name printed on it scarlett 8
