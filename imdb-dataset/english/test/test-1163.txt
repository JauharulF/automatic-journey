<START> where to begin this hideous excuse for a motion picture makes plan 9 from outer space look well thought out the music it's culled from every single overwrought piece of pd shlock in existence the focus hell doesn't matter if in one shot there are thirty people standing in the road the new angle shows a lone packard with a waitress posing for mag shots paul le mat diana scarwid louise fletcher wallace shawn fine actors who must have all been starving to death at that point in their lives and the director lured them to sign on with tempting bits of cat food the production budget must have to well over fifty cents with the addition of the space alien phallic transportation machine which for a time must have meant that the oscar meyer mobile was not available when bad movies happen to good actors
<START> discovering something the journey is so much more fun so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally arrive at the destination falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world you feel energized invigorated and alive you simply want to be around that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes aroused love and all the physical and emotional side effects that comes with it is pure bliss where it goes from here is anyone's guess but when you first begin your journey together nothing can compare to it br br diane lane and richard gere play adrienne willis and dr paul two emotionally scarred middle aged individuals in this film they are about to embark on that mystical journey together where love and the discovery of the emotions along the way will help save them br br lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an ex husband who still loves her but in her eyes only because the woman he cheated with no longer wants him as hurt as she was by him as much as she really dislikes him there is a part of her that is actually considering taking him back why you might ask because in life and love sometimes comfort supersedes intelligence yes this man cheated on her but she has kids with him she built a life with him and there is obviously still a connection with him br br richard gere plays a recently divorced husband and estranged father he also just lost a patient as she reacted negatively to the anesthetic he is now being sued by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue this is what brings him to in the first place although his lawyer told him not to he felt compelled to visit the woman's husband in he stays at the inn that adrienne is taking care of soon they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life br br by now this sounds like a simple idea for a film and although it might be something you've seen or read about before gere and lane simply own the film diane lane lights the screen up with her smile her eyes twinkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one worth watching gere's character is a little different he is more hardened and bitter it takes adrienne's pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell he blames quietly himself for his strained relationship with his son and her secretly blames himself for the death of the patient on the outside he tells anyone who will listen that it is not his fault and that she was a 1 in 50 000 casualty but deep down it eats away at him they find each other at a time when both need someone to listen br br gere and lane have been in film together before but this is the first time they play lovers they were married in unfaithful but here they play lovers finding each other when the people in their lives have abandoned them they have a spark and a real chemistry i would love to see more films with them together in fact i'd love to see more films with diane lane but that's a story for another time br br nights in is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other they both become better people they both become stronger people i enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone not just couples this is a film about redemption absolution and second chances br br it will also ask you to bring some hankies br br 8 10
<START> i am awed by actress bobbie phillips and her superb skill as an action star this movie is propelled by her wonderful acting and terrific action prowess i am a fan of sci fi but i must say that this film exceeds most science fiction films in it's cinematography and mostly it's of an actress whose presence supersedes the plot which is fine but is nothing new even though it looks as though this film was made for television in my opinion it is better than most theatrically released films of its kind
<START> it's a shame this movie didn't get more play in theatres it's a rich textured love story with believable all too human characters who are too busy gaming and protecting their hearts to recognize the real thing when they experience it one of the most pleasurable aspects of this movie is its setting in chicago among hip artistic literate middle class african americans who discuss poetry music and literature another is his royal larenz tate and if you are even half a fan of his you need to see this film his boyish cockiness and vulnerability are perfect for the role of darius long also shines as nina who longs to tell darius she loves him but is afraid the break the rules a great movie to watch curled up on the couch with your sweetie
<START> although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your parent's high school life and many people will try to tell you that this movie is way outdated and i admit that that was my first impression but honestly the that are learned by the heroes heroines are def not outdated who doesn't want to be famous and who doesn't want do be accepted my their peers and the homosexual guy isn't there a whole controversy today about gay marriage blah blah this movie though released in the 80's still addresses some of the biggest issues in today's world this movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste though thus the 8 10 rating
<START> this is the first movie i have watched in ages where i actually ended up fast forwarding through the tedious bits which there are plenty of very ordinary movie i'm glad i missed it at the movies got a 2 for 1 video deal which included this movie instead
<START> this isn't a life changing movie it's not an epic or anything like that but it's entertaining and it's fun it's a film that the whole family can watch together and at the moment there are precious few kid suitable films that don't have a love story in them it tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to dazzle the audience with over the top special effects like lots of films these days are it's got some fairly good acting in and all the music that's been used fits in pretty well with the movie content the acting is quite good too the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny i'd recommend it for people of all ages it certainly made me laugh
<START> this movie's basic premise is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay except for that person and that a man who likes show tunes has good taste and is neat in appearance must be a homosexual yes the movie is funny in parts but the basic premise is to homophobic and insulting that the entire movie crumbles into something that is quite painful to sit through the performances particularly joan cusak and kevin kline are very good
<START> master came with an idea in 1993 the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today passing from blue a crafted visual masterpiece about a woman's life from white a visual comedy movie about marriage and finally arriving to red a masterpiece dealing with human interaction br br while i'm not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90's decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seen br br the movie begins a little slow but finds it's rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie br br the performances are perfect sublime since the characters are completely realistic and they're not clichÃ©d in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesn't get disappointed seriously i believe jean louis deserved an oscar nod at least br br the music from is amazing it's one of the best musical scores ever piotr cinematography is also outstanding he got an oscar nod for it and deserved to win br br overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who don't don't miss it br br how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my comprehension
<START> this is one of my favorite movies the performances of rip torn and cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music scenery and reality of the movie are quite compelling a look at a true tell it like it is logging mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development the music of the is very unique and adds an eerie quality to some of the scenes after seeing this movie for the first time i had to go out and purchase the video and the soundtrack overall a quiet type of movie with bursts of panic both torn and cardinal are very believable in their roles i put this movie in the same category as winter people with kurt russell and kelly mcgillis another favorite
<START> me and a friends form university alberto lopez dave hall celina we graduated from uk in 1997 still get together and watch b movies once a month br br we are consummate experts in the art of bad movie making and this film was quickly placed in the top 10 of awful brilliant movies br br so if you've just got the beers and weed in and need a film to laugh like a drain at droid gunner aka phoenix 2 is the film for you marc singer is totally aware he's in a turkey of a film here and milks it for everything he can hues is sublime in his wooden acting and musclebound is that a word as he grunts but i want my 20 thousand pure shlock gold if you liked this also see trancers the dollman and anything by charles band or fred olen ray but be warned some of their films are completely and utterly without merit and you'll be screaming for those lost hours of your life
<START> as john pointed out the documentary genre can be defined like this the creative interpretation of reality br br this fabulous 180 minute documentary marks the first time a computer generated project about dinosaurs respects the intelligence of the viewer br br when i saw jurassic park which i was expecting with great excitement i was left extremely disappointed of course the dinosaurs were great but the story telling was unnecessary i thought what if they made a documentary on dinosaurs with no crying children or bad puns just dinosaurs made as realistic as possible to let us marvel at what was once reality br br my dream came true the bbc has produced an exhilarating documentary exploring the different eras of the dinosaurs br br this part is to all the people that seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess at many points concerning the behavior skin patterns etc of course they have to nobody was there i think it is fantastic that they could present something as realistic as that the are all based on the of many paleontologists and it allows the viewer to have a pretty good idea of what it was like if you wanna stick to what we know for sure then just go visit a dinosaur bones museum that is why i incorporated the quote at the beginning of this comment br br anyway hats off to the creators of it
<START> the movie was awful the production company should be required to pay a fine for wasting electricity transmitting this nonsense br br there were too many holes in the plot why would the send a killer out to assassinate a world leader if they weren't the why would they send someone they thought would not do the job to quote butch cassidy who are those guys apparently the director does not know either because he never told us br br the characters were unbelievable they did not behave in any way that seemed to fit who they allegedly were with the exception of the doctor none of the characters were particularly compelling or likeable br br if you want to waste money on the electricity required to watch this movie feel free otherwise run the opposite direction
<START> this movie has got to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst one i've ever seen it wasn't even a bad b movie i would have rated it at as a z the special effects were ridiculous err if you could even call them special effects i think the reviewer before hit the nail on the head it was the box that sold the movie while the cover art was great and the synopsis intriguing which both is why i rented it it was a waste of not only time but money as well i didn't last long i took it back to the store and switched it out for another movie i believe my local video store took it off the shelf because they had soooo many complaints about this horrible movie my 6 year old could have done a better job filming it writing the script
<START> this movie was great and funny pauly is funny the best looking girl is all the way tiffani she is totally hot in this film and she proves she can act with this film this movie is a must see comedy and its not all about tiffani its a great movie in general but tiffani adds the zest to this film cause she does her scenes very well and she is all the way sexy
