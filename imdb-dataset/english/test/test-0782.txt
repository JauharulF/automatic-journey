<START> yet again not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable in fact this one is just boring it's reasonably well made even though the script is bad the effects are ok and the acting average apart from james mason who is always great but in this one underused br br i suppose it is hard to write anything about this film because it didn't evoke any reaction in me what so ever br br dull dull dull dull dull
<START> this is a poor caricature of lonesome dove and larry br br i love your books with lonesome dove among the top three i have admired the way you view yourself through your characters with such unflinching honesty balanced by never taking it all too seriously i am therefore spoiled br br why have you come to this br br comanche moon is not up to your standards i see that you are credited with the screen writing but this is so unlike you i prefer to think it is written by someone else br br the dialogue makes me claustrophobic wishing someone would break out with a naturally stated sentence the part about was agonizing was unrecognizable chiefly because of the inane words coming out of his mouth br br well i miss call too br br the most important missing factors are gus and call and the men they are their matter of fact courage the underlying vein comprised of ethics and honesty their lack of self delusion hard men leading hard lives with a certain undeniable grace br br some blame has to attach to the labored direction here and throughout all of the cast needed dialect and dialogue coaching br br while i try to imagine robert duvall as speaking this same dialogue it comes off better but not much it tries to sound cowboy of few words shy sly grin witty but doesn't half succeed br br how can it be so different from lonesome dove can the writer have forgotten his characters you have fooled some of the people mr but not this one
<START> alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930's margaret mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels i was a huge fan of margaret book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for money br br although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton this is a really terrible film the script is horrible and full of clichÃ©s ann cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap her br br the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy feral villain lord fenton sean bean's performance is along the lines of the man you love to hate and portrays an unsafe sex symbol br br but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably boring script br br don't waste your money on this film unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance
<START> first of all i have nothing against christianity i believe every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses but i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this what a waste of money they'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries i don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this movie because i couldn't find any of those in this story's simple two reporters one a is atheist the other b for some sake has abandoned religion b regains his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson believe in christ or go to hell this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie people do not believe the rating of this movie read reviews first i didn't and wasted an hour of my life ps why is it classified as sci fi because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky u f o satan's evil doings that's a new one
<START> this is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time bette midler comes as close to real magic on screen as anyone has in her turn as gypsy lee's blustery bosomy brave and very scary mother she evokes a sense of desperation that is at times both comic and tragic but always genuine and quite beautiful such charm and grit she is indeed a pioneer woman without a frontier that frontier is discovered for the children who in turn must forge their own in a world ruled by their domineering mother br br this particular version is as i understand it in it's entirety including the brilliant choreography of jerome robbins as well as the original stage directions
<START> one has to be careful whom one tells about watching 12 hour long films it could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular occurrence in fact even in the world of cinema such mammoth running times are extremely rare for obvious reasons this is one thing that hollywood and art cinema share in common the generally accepted running time of 90 120 minutes with a minority of movies that dare to approach but rarely exceed the three hour mark br br for this reason a film like out 1 runtime minutes is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to find br br originally devised as a tv series by maverick nouvelle vague director jacques rivette it raised little interest from the french networks and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead peter was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo documentary the war game although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time shown a couple of times in 1971 out 1 has re emerged at a handful of rivette retrospectives over the last two decades and many who have seen it including esteemed us critic jonathan rosenbaum have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all time br br is it well yes if you like rivette that alone is a big as jacques rivette has never been a commercially successful director only two of his films were hits celine and julie go boating 1974 and la belle 1991 both superb and many remain difficult to find on dvd today out 1 only recently became available over the internet after a rare videotape was uploaded nevertheless he is greatly respected within the film community and with good reason his playfully surreal narratives sense of pacing and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinema's most unique and satisfying film makers br br out 1 deals with a theme that re occurs throughout rivette's work the nature of acting particularly in the context of theatre and improvisation his fascination with acting make rivette's films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries as the improvisational aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in determining how the film comes together out 1 is roughly divided into four major narratives gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops two consisting of acting each trying to devise post modern theatrical adaptations of plays the other two individual petty thieves played by nouvelle vague icons jean pierre lÃ©aud and juliet pursuing eccentric methods of making money and an overarching plot involving a mysterious balzac inspired conspiracy centred around an organisation known as 'the br br as with any rivette film featuring a narrative the mysteries and secret organisations are little more than a red herring as the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal connections break down the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post 1968 ennui and the decline of the ideals of that era for a film made in 1971 these were remarkably prescient themes another french director in jean eustache would tackle this topic equally satisfyingly in his 1973 masterpiece the mother and the whore but this is not the limit of out 1's scope br br comprised of eight episodes of roughly 90 minutes each the beginning of each episode has a brief abstract black and white still montage of the events of the previous chapter out 1 is no less watchable than any quality tv series and may even be better experienced on a one episode at a time basis this is not to say that it doesn't remain challenging even when viewed in segments like most rivette films it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot of sorts and some of those early scenes particularly the sequences depicting the actors' heavily abstracted seem interminably long these scenes are important however not just as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languorous pace of the film paradoxically long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience and this understanding of pacing has led rivette along with more modern directors like michael haneke and tarr to create films with less commercial running times that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralled br br in a film that is in many ways about acting the acting is fantastic many famous nouvelle vague faces appear including the aforementioned lÃ©aud and the outstanding michel and rivette regular even another legendary director in eric rohmer has a great cameo as a balzac professor who appears in a pivotal scene the people and architecture of paris c 1971 though seem to have an equally significant role the city landscapes crowd scenes and interested onlookers freeze out 1 in time a document of a place at a point in history br br after a little more than minutes the film ends on an impossibly brief enigmatic note yet the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities intricacy and spontaneity that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters for those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and diverge in so many more directions than current conventions allow for film makers film critics and artists of all disciplines this is something to be cherished
<START> while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring star trek the final frontier is plain bad in this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth romulus and kronos the klingon home world have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier there he hopes to find god using mysticism and bad writing he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god like alien this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin at the core is a good idea that is never really developed the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco the action scenes don't have the suspense of wrath of kahn the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner when he takes the director's chair the ego gets bigger most of the focus is on him spock and mccoy but does not give the others enough to do moreover whereas shatner is usually guilty of over acting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one now kirk is reckless a practical jokers and silly one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song row row row your boat in a round by a campfire in any case this is the worst of the star trek franchise i should have given it three out of ten instead of five
<START> i love this show i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the season starts again i have followed this show since its pilot then all the way threw from where rusty starts college and see's casey his sister to now where he's dating dana love this show cant wait until monday night also i am so glad that and casey finally got back together that was driving me crazy as for evan and rebecca i hope they get back together which it just feels like they will by the finale i just looked it up about the main part of the cast and i am so shocked that casey cartwright spencer grammar is kelsey grammar's daughter that just surprises me so much and the other thing that's a huge shocker is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born on my baby brother birth date with my year and i had been watching her the whole entire time and had no clue
<START> a killer john with a penchant for really bad disguises afro wig on a white dude cruises around in his van looking for victims detective decarlo james is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird again the afro wig comes into play tracking the killer to his home decarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist br br inspired by the crimes of ted bundy before he was caught killer's delight is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick director jeremy has no idea how to pace a film or even make it suspenseful he does know how to show lots of close ups of the killer wringing his hands though the only thing this really has going for it is the captured 70s atmosphere look out for the bathroom wallpaper well that and a downbeat ending the media blasters shriek show dvd has lots of nice stuff though including an audio commentary by and plus video interviews trailers and an alternate opening
<START> i loved the gorgeous greek scenery but the story which is not something you can follow anyway was even harder to follow in the movie i cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book and then like me they would probably wonder why australian allison turned into french anne and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story the mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie i saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then since i had read the book several times i recently watched it with my granddaughter very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies i like who was mostly amazed at how young michael caine and candace bergen were in it but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery
<START> continuing in the string of stalker slasher flicks in the vein of wolf creek hostel joy ride etc comes rest stop the most unoriginal and useless one of them all br br we start reasonably promising with the violent death of a pretty young girl in a filthy restroom br br this is where our interest is lost we then move to the clichÃ© road trip couple on their way to la with their eyes on acting stardom which doing movies like this they'll never achieve br br from the sexual romp in the park the couple drives arguing all the way to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl to use the bathroom harmless enough until she exits and finds her boyfriend missing and realizes she's being stalked by a lame version of joy ride 's rusty nail only driving around in mater from cars br br honestly if this had been directed written produced acted by anyone else it might've been fairly good but no br br because then comes the ghost story yup you guessed it plenty of oh i'll help you but wait you're dead to wait is this stalker a person monster or ghost br br but wait who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie that one brother excellent we're saved sarcasm oh wait no we're not br br you know if you want to laugh off a pretty bad or if you get free rentals like i do give it a try br br if anything you'll learn how not to make a movie br br ap3
<START> wow just wow never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert that somebody wrote one day in 20 minutes and then i happened to come upon lady frankenstein this movie takes everything you know about frankenstein and turns it completely upside down and not in a good way if you've seen this movie you either stumbled across it on italian tv or you have the dubbed version on the 50 chilling classics box set like i have as number 24 and lets just say there's a reason why these movies are here because they're not very good enough of that though onto the movie br br it starts out with dr frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant who's obviously not igor for some reason his college graduate daughter shows up and states how she just graduated with a medical degree cause yeah there were so many female doctors back then so she states how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no and then he makes the monster and it kills him so she grieves for exactly 7 seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was a burglar the monster escapes and goes on a rampage br br ok i really can't believe they killed dr frankenstein so early in the movie he dies like 20 minutes in and then his daughter takes over which doesn't make a whole lot of sense but sure br br so lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster who's now rampaging is to make another monster oh yes how i love her logic so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting the brain of the assistant in it i know just nod and go along with it so the monsters meet and duke it out i love how the assistant asks why don't we just let the mobs kill it and she answers with they wouldn't know how to kill it and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head haha oh yeah nobody else could have figured that one out so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein the end br br this movie was just weird it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert there's no other way to describe this movie there were some odd naked scenes too like this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend the monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away haha nice guy she then struggles a bit and dies from to be quite honest i really don't know what she died from but whatever it's lady frankenstein it doesn't have to make sense br br this movie had a lot of those why moments to the point that i just gave up movies shouldn't do that but for some reason i see that more than i probably should br br so final word it's not the worst movie i've seen on this pack but it's a tad boring and full of many many holes and random things br br so lady frankenstein gets 3 frankenstein porn scenes out of 10
<START> i accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels i immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast groovy haircuts aside and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars having not seen the original i guessed it might be the poseidon adventure since it was obviously on a ship in distress was i wrong i cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great or promising actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash there is no story the performances all looked forced the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy br br it is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as sally field michael caine et al they must have needed the money badly can we blame the director
<START> i just saw this at the castro theatre in san francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive unenlightening little film it is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material it's not bad in any offensive way it just repeats things that have been said many many times over and more interestingly and provocatively with only a couple of exceptions the interviews drone on and on and on making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic it's more like a how to guide for something that can't be done anymore i was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented
<START> this is a great off the wall romantic comedy about love work pandering to the public taste and midlife crises the main character is a talented movie director who decides to make a silly pg 13 movie to get himself out of hock with the irs it has an excellent cast a wide range of humor from deadpan to slapstick and fine writing it's also a wry send up of the movie industry the includes several excellent cuts between reality and the movie that's being made and in some places the film departs from strict realism the result is a multi dimensional masterpiece of wry midlife humor
