<START> recently was traveling in norway from bergen norway and stopped in the small town of voss norway and there was a monument in honor of who was born in voss years ago the people all know about to this day and tour guides are proud to stop at his monument this film is a great history of this great man and his great love for notre dame never realized that has such great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time coached the football team ronald reagan played the role of george the who was an outstanding football player reagan had a short role but gave a great supporting role in this film donald crisp father john callahan was outstanding as a priest who always had great faith in during his entire life at notre dame this is a great classic film and will be viewed by many generations to come enjoy
<START> usually when bbc releases a tv series one is used to a certain satisfaction guarantee usually the tv series is splendid even if the story is boring you can trust the acting will make the it worth while when i came across persuasion here at the local library i was looking forward to an enjoyable evening cause i read the story br br i'm glad i read the story first otherwise i would not think highly of it further was i relieved to learn that the production date of this tv series was from 1971 since i thought until that moment that bbc had lost it it is really bad and should be used in acting schools as a horror movie br br the only positive thought i have about this series that the people in this film are not likely to appear or be involved in any bbc or other product this century other than the young sisters who apparently were taking their fist steps in acting and doing remarkably well under the direction otherwise given
<START> let's get it clear from the start i am an asshole with the emotional sensitivity of cubic stone therefore i consider dramas of people with disabilities social stigma or whatever ailments they have and cry on and on about it as stupid movies with poor taste i mean if you have a message you can tell it without the help of sick or pitiful people br br however i liked this movie it is about people with incredible bad luck as personal health goes but they don't cry about it quite the opposite they try to live and people try to protect or take care of them by actively removing them from real life the message is live life to the fullest even if the ending is as sad as possible br br my conclusion as sick people dramas go this one is a keeper it is sad yet hopeful i like james mcavoy even if he does seem to always play the arrogant rebel i also say that steven robertson played very well either that or he really has partial paralysis
<START> a good example of reversed politically correct racism where white men are presented as senseless brutes who're only there to be massacred and their aboriginal adversaries as noble heroes superior both in their appearance and abilities apart from making the story dull this also prevents the neutral viewer to identify himself with one or the other side it's just too simplifying the repetitive score is incredibly annoying as is the voice over the characters lack any depth and the viewer is soon lost between questions like who is this character and what the hell is that supposed to mean photography is wonderful though and on the whole there's a lot of atmosphere to it but nice shots of misty landscapes alone don't save this movie the dvd box uses kiefer sutherland as an eye catcher in fact his character could have been played by anyone else because it's basically just an empty shell like most non characters and disappears anyway around halfway the film but if you are eager to see jack bauer in a kilt that's your kind of movie
<START> in order for a thriller to elicit fear suspense or any emotion the story must be believable there is nothing believable or realistic about this film the protagonists have several opportunities to escape or turn the tables but manage to screw it up every time the antagonists who supposedly plan this out and customized their shuttle specifically to trap people sure left a lot of improvisational weapons laying around there is actually one scene where the smart girl has a gun to the head of the main bad guy and decides to scold him instead of pull the trigger this was a thoroughly predictably brainless thriller every character was one dimensional the victims were the usual gutless brainless sheep that deserved to be slaughtered is there anyone on this planet capable of writing an intelligent thriller
<START> i'm amazed that i have a real affection for this one inasmuch as i'm not an action and adventure lover but hey it's pretty tough to go wrong with a robert carlyle film i've read several poor or reviews on this film pulling it apart for it's period errors or unlikely plot development but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition which features how a hardened down on his luck scoundrel carlyle transforms into a rather noble selfless hero and how the pretty boy cowardly vagrant miller develops a real taste for the life of a highway man once he gets the feel of it filled with lots of bad boy humor lavish scenes particularly the use of fireworks by former and a charmingly musical score is a fast paced highly enjoyable piece of film making it's certainly worth your viewing time for the climax scene alone shoot 'em up boys
<START> the premise of bottom crossed with fawlty towers sounds great however have managed to create a film that raises barely a titter ten years ago mayall's mad stare and idiocy were funny now they are just annoying br br the film had promise though the most horrendous hotel in britain is not a new idea but failed to deliver the saving graces were competent performances from simon spaced big train pegg and mathieu and the film is only 90 minutes long sorry guys but you really have hit the bottom
<START> in a phrase moral ambiguity in the soderbergh remake there are good guys and bad guys benicio del toro's character is clearly the good guy morally clean and uncorruptable his counterpart in the bbc original the farmer turned dealer is realistically flawed and conflicted over his fate the two relentless cops are similarly different in the american one they win our hearts in the bbc original they are over zealous nearly obsessive br br the best moment for me in soderbergh's was when the college student rhetorically asked the drug czar what would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came into your neighborhood looking for drugs that point was insinuated throughout the bbc show and crystallized in jack lithgow's final speech both are excellent but the bbc towers over the remake my conclusion after seeing both shows is that dealers are innocent pawns who are only supplying a demand and it is the demand that causes so much suffering
<START> six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses the one negative review happens to reside or did on the first page of the movie's location in the imdb br br i found what alice found to be one of the best movies almost no one's heard of that i have seen this year it's 6 4 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing guess again br br for me alice was a positively gripping psychological thriller i was virtually on the edge of my seat the entire time it's a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well cast in a fairer world actress judith would win awards for keeping you guessing whether she was good or evil br br ignore the rating and see this terrific movie and by the way i wish there was a soundtrack album
<START> alright i'm 12 so this is where you get to see the movie from a pre teen's point of view i've also commented on magnolia and man both great movies if you want to check it out alright here on earth was a beautiful movie with astounding scenes and images very pleasing to the eye the writer i don't know who it was check imdb either worked very hard or has a good appreciation for love poetry and drama i cried 4 times throughout this movie once for over 30 minutes it was really sad really beautiful really meaningful it's a great movie for anyone say 11 and up who isn't a romantic comedy freak yeah it's romantic yeah it's comedic but in my opinion it's better than she's all that or whatever it takes i never cry it's a tender story go rent it and tape it
<START> nickelodeon has gone down the toilet they have kids saying things like oh my god and we're screwed br br this show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking or aren't in the in crowd it say that sexual promiscuity is alright by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt the main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary friend sam who may be a lesbian beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path which says it's alright to be a b ch this show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it i give it a 0 out of 10
<START> i used to watch this show when i was growing up when i think about it i remember it very well if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember very well are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was ideally cast the writing was also very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i haven't seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> a friend warned me that this was the worst movie he had ever seen i was curious because it had developed a bit of a cult status i like a lot of odd indie cult movies so i gave it a shot i have to agree with my friend it is a steaming pile of dung i am sorry to the people who love this movie but i can recommend much better stuff if you want to watch a twisted indie cult film try peter jackson's dead alive aka braindead cemetery man aka or modern vampires
<START> i just saw a tale of two sisters last night and really enjoyed it i've been a big fan of asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from south korea there aren't many jump out at you scares as in the usual american horror film but the director does maintain the off kilter and foreboding mood very well especially in the awkward character interactions with each other most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's there's something under the bed fears from when they were a child but in this case it's the closet and the sink i also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together he's also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering tv i think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you br br major spoilers ahead do not read any further if you do not want the twists of the movie revealed i was following the story pretty well but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part however i think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together the film is very much like the machinist in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions br br here's my interpretation of the film the su yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of su mi or the actual ghost of su yeon that only su mi can see and interact with the initial stepmother that we see is in my opinion a delusion of su mi there is a real stepmother however and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit i believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house the stepmother before that point is imagined by su mi perhaps part of her split personality that explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and doesn't remember anything that she recounts i think it was su mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality the film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make up in the mirror which is revealed later to actually be su mi wiping her make up in the mirror br br i think the ghosts in the house aren't entirely imagined by su mi and are either of su yeon or the mother or both in the final flashback it is revealed the su yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died this is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink also it's the hairpin that su yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink br br the real stepmother in the end gets punished by the ghost of su yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like the ring after that the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death while su mi unintentionally played a supporting role br br i wonder if the mother that su yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry in the flashback is a ghost already perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet that's left ambiguous br br other things that are suggested but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother at some point was a nurse perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too it's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself it's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too requiring a nurse the stepmother alludes to this when she tells su mi you're beginning to take after your mother i don't think she meant just physically br br also if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually su mi then there's the suggestion of incest too since the father sleeps with her is that why su mi freaks out and shouts don't touch me each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes is that the filthy things that you've done that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father this film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations a few of the scenes however were kind of derivative such as the woman in the black crawling around scene which reminded me of the herky jerky movements of in the ju on the grudge films also the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of the ring furthermore just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the sixth sense or the others br br overall i enjoyed it however and it will be interesting to see how the hollywood remake that's already in production turns out i have to be honest i liked both the ring and the grudge so i'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too one remake that i'm really excited about is dark water coming out this summer i haven't seen the original japanese version yet but both films are definitely on my to see list
<START> daniel dirty war a bbc production made for television was shown recently on cable the film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people that caused the near holocaust in one of the big metropolis of the world london in fact this film produced in 2004 is almost a cautionary tale of the events of the following year in which terrorists set explosive devices in the public transport that killed innocent people that were in the wrong place at the wrong time br br the film impresses for the pace the director and the production team gave to the project there are no dull moments in the movie as we watch the preparation by the terrorists and the people that are following their dirty work although the inevitable happens it's amazing just to think what would be the consequences if a real 'dirty was planted in such a densely populated area br br the last images of the film have a chilling effect the mob scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated send shivers of fear thinking how it could possible happen anywhere
