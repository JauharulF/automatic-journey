<START> problems 1 although billed as a loving tribute to poverty row a lot of the old footage is not even from poverty row films much of it is from rko's the most dangerous game 1932 with some from the silent version of the lost world 1926 br br 2 much of the old footage is just used as filler the old shipboard footage or as silent shots for example of bela walking looking or staring often repeated br br 3 where is the pantheon of poverty row master thespians bela boris lon chaney jr george zucco john carradine buster crabbe tom neal etc emoting their lines as punch lines to the 'new' characters jokes as in woody allen's what's up tiger lily or steve martin's dead men don't wear plaid even mike nelson's feeble commentary on the colorized reefer madness is funnier than this br br high point the long but extremely enlightening lecture by gregory which makes you give new respect to and admiration for bela john carradine and george zucco that's worth the price of the dvd alone
<START> my husband received dvd of for christmas and it was the best gift we received we watch it every time we need to laugh and so far we have viewed it 12 times the scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstanding we also purchased the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is daily if anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is it the characters are hilarious charming and their facial expressions are too funny to describe i have always been a fan of george clooney but now i am also a fan of tim blake nelson delmar and john turturro pete and am now looking for them in other movies you gotta see this movie
<START> after having seen the lost child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995 and having read the reader's comments mostly about jane background and helen mirren's superb role in it it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role robert is playing as chris hughes even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser carrying the weight of his own past watching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of his actions i have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me helen mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her praise for robert
<START> cherry tells of a naive unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby but isn't quite sure how to go about it this easy going little sleeper is full of quirky characters and tongue in cheek situational humor fresh fun mold breaking stuff i happened to really enjoy this flick for whatever that's worth recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different
<START> this abomination and the sequel one more time no thanks and the hideous jerry lewis disasters like don't raise the bridge lower the water why not just flush instead drove cinema owners to close their doors rather than be forced to run these films true in the 60s block booking of films was still enforced on hapless suburban and country cinemas this means that in order to get a good film the cinema was forced to run woeful like these i remember well in 1974 keen to screen fiddler on the roof or something good like that i was bailed up in the united artists booking office by some sozzled salesman who waved a sheet of flops before me and bellowing now before we get to that one lemme see ya date these ones first which basically means book these duds and we will give ya a tired hit this is how and why so many cinemas closed forced to screen and annoy their waning audiences with these assembly line failures with lame comedians and bored talent cinema owners exhausted with arguing simply closed sold to a petrol station and saw the cinema demolished these days the same type of films eg i now pronounce you chuck and larry get banished to the 20 seat cinema 99 in a mega google plex instead not much has changed freddy got fingered anyone
<START> is unquestionably a comedian's comedian and a comedian to anyone looking for a good time his first film which is entirely his own creation and production tells the story of a struggling chicago actor james aaron with whom jeff obviously identifies he wonderfully juxtaposes james to paddy marty and to jackie gleason's poor soul as he exposes james' dilemmas with an array of actors that in real life are jeff's friends many who are fellow second city alumni br br he delightfully uses sarah silverman's cuteness and scathingly absurd humor to exemplify how despite common sense and talent life's contentment can too often belie unyielding frustration bonnie hunt gives an endearing performance as a romantic interest br br don't let a simple story mislead you the characters and conflicts are well thought out and ring true those that follow career and understand that his humor is based on telling reality humorously not necessarily creating fiction which too easily can be contrived will appreciate his dialogue driven story br br we surely will see working much more as director and writer with other talented intelligent comedic actors who undertake the great challenge of making life funny
<START> it's strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best you've seen this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller guns techno baddies cash etc and yet it stands out from your average hollywood also ran i would credit this to two very charismatic people christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women i've ever seen on screen another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to after the beginning the jamaican resort is so beautiful you'll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night with a i know i did i'm very glad i saw this movie it was just too nice to miss
<START> released at a time when duvivier was going again from strength to strength black jack which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary au des and the dazzling stunning sous le ciel de paris is a jumble which duvivier himself hated which is not surprising there's almost nothing to write about this dud we can notice that br br 1 orson welles used to admire duvivier that may explain why wellesian actors were featured in duvivier's movies joseph cotten in lydia 1941 and here a totally wasted agnes moorehead it's the first time br br i have not enjoyed performance on the other hand welles borrowed his desdemona suzanne from duvivier's au des for his othello br br 2 in any duvivier's movie there's one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception the search in the caves where duvivier's sense of mystery works wonders for a short while then the chase when gets caught up in the duvivier's touch can be felt in the unhappy end too br br as for the rest as my dear pen pal writer's reign writes it's a black joke
<START> i can't believe that there are people out there who voted 10 for this garbage have any of you gained access to a computer in the madhouse where you are undoubtably kept or is there a special colony where especially crass people are secretly imprisoned that i don't know about br br if i was to say what i really thought of this film none of it would get published br br to begin with its 'star' is a no talent idiot who acts like a bad impersonator of jim carrey who has enough angel dust up his nose to resurface the sahara desert his name will be a total guarantee that i will not watch a future film with him in it even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowd br br as for the 'plot' one more crime that we can chalk up to the nazis is that they were so awful that they can be considered fair game as 'baddies' in tripe like this mere criminals and murderers would have the audience on their side in a trice br br to the people who made this movie give up making films and if not then confine yourself to making advertisements where your efforts will at least have the virtue of being fleeting in duration br br finally a criticism of imdb why don't you have the facility to vote for a film or perhaps not to express my contempt for this tripe i would then have to vote double zero or something
<START> time travel into the past is tenuous at best as a topic in this episode a man who has been thinking about the possibility finds himself at the date and location of the assassination of abraham lincoln he tries everything he can think of in the short time available to him with predictable results of course he is thought to be quite mad he is arrested and eventually to the very man he is attempting to stop serling was bright enough to let him return to the present but is the present the same this is kind of a precursor to the time tunnel where time travelers on a weekly basis were given the same task overcoming what had already happened unfortunately the implications of the distortion of time and the future always negate the result unless you have something like ray bradbury's the sound of thunder
<START> a captures a mythical on a caribbean island to get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and i think the script intended disastrous results br br lets start with the one thing i really did not like about this movie the monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit the cgi scenes looked like a different movie ok thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this b movie br br the best thing was john rhys davies his daughter the eye candy a close second john was intermittently funny and suave and no matter what the writers made him say he said it well good job given what he had to work with the was over the top and fun to watch too he had some funny bits the marines all were ok and make good cannon fodder for the monster as did some of the crew and guests there are a few pretty funny lines in this movie and a pretty amusing sub plot involving a thief br br the special effects are generally med to low and i swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie i did like the gore of the legless man really since this movie was not scary at all i feel a bit more gore would have gone along way in improving the watch ability of this movie br br all in all if you like b monsters this one is worth a visit
<START> possible spoilers included but nothing critical given away br br i just watched this classic low budget movie on video and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen all the actors do themselves proud especially john daniels must see another of his films not only does this movie boast great performances but manages stylish sequences like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man i love the way slow motion photography was used in 70's cinema dreamy and hypnotic cool and witty black dudes spout great one liners while slimy seedy lumps of white trash come to unpleasant ends i love it my rating 10 10 if this ever comes out on dvd count me in for a purchase
<START> two soldiers is an excellent example of fine film making the director and producer took a heart warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent cinematography and very creative artistry br br the relaxed back woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into the interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back woods of north carolina and an even harder life of war br br the acting was great particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen played by jonathan to the older brother played by ben allison and the powerful by the colonel played by ron perlman the performance was extremely well cast br br it was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers and i heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages
<START> a demon from a tree removes itself in the form of a human man to make love to a young fair maiden only for her to die the demon's eyes freeze two drops of blood fall onto a bed he had specially created for his object of desire the bed consumes the blood and it's hunger remains anything that comes in contact with the bed is consumed this is explained to us by one of the victims a painter whose soul is trapped inside one of his last works the artistic rendering of the his final resting place he was dying of consumption coughing up blood deciding to die on the death bed you see the painter who we are able to see as if he were trapped in a small room looking through his painting unfortunately a spectator to the meals the bed has a dark sense of humor and we see this through it's allowing the painter to live even giving him jewelry and other possessions once owned by eaten victims one victim's skull grows bright red flowers not far from the basement housing the bed the film features three young women who come across the mansion which holds the basement containing the death bed the painter dave marsh might just have a method to destroying the death bed but it will include a human sacrifice in order to resurrect the body of the one whose death caused it's hunger in the first place patrick spence thomas provides the soft depressing voice of the trapped painter narrating the film lamenting about his current situation telling us about past victims and often scolding the bed of it's predatory nature br br a definitive genuine cult film i expect it's status to soar now that death bed the bed that eats has found it's way to an audience such as myself who appreciates the bizarre and grotesque the bed itself contains a liquid type of acid with an apple cider hue where we see the objects and humans struggling for naught consumed many might recognize a young william russ boy meets world the unholy in curls seeking after his runaway sister finding her in the basement zombie like and traumatized of course julie ritter pretty much was this way the whole film in a trance barely uttering a word with them both trapped in one of the film's most demented scenes russ attempts to stab the bed only for his hands to get caught in it's grip the flesh with only skeletal bones remaining the cartilage deteriorating there's one attempted escape by a victim whose legs were caught in the bed almost out of the basement when it's sheets snatched her back into it's belly where she belonged the film feels almost completely surreal as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold director george barry often features gags regarding the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position choosing the death bed as their place of refuge the painter gives us a recollection of all the various people who were eaten there's really nothing like this movie anywhere it's definitely one of a kind
