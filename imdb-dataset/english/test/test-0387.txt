<START> i haven't had a chance to view the previous film but from what i've read on other posts it was supposedly worse than this one although i doubt that is possible i'm a huge fan of the zombie genre and i am fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures that for all intents and purposes are human as an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head that said hotd 2 takes the zombie movie to an all new low br br without giving any big spoilers which i really should do just so you won't bother wasting your time actually watching this movie i would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writers of this film portray our countries special forces gomer pile could have probably survived longer than the spec ops soldiers in this film for crying out loud they should have called them the special education forces instead if you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an outbreak of zombies at least have the soldiers be smarter than the walking corpses i understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team but you can find better ways to do it than having them set down their machine guns and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling crazy person rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basement br br the writers actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more high tech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a vaccine for and the idea has merit if it wasn't stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of wayward film making i mean come on zombie films aren't exactly high art and the viewer expects some tongue in cheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrills but hotd 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the characters if you are a zombie movie fan like me please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one
<START> so why on earth would i see 'sex lives of the potato men' answer johnny vegas and mackenzie crook vegas i have seen live and thoroughly enjoyed i think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic who manages to retain extreme crook i know only from probably the greatest comedy of the last 10 years along with 'alan 'the office' as gareth he was simply hilarious and i was interested in how he would convert to another character on the big screen br br ok so me and the boyfriend went down to the multiplex last night and the film was very funny only because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and banter ferris and dave had was delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of vegas and crook they are destined for better things have done better already infact and i even believe vegas would make a decent straight actor the trite scenes where he says he misses his wife came almost close to touching although the spoiler tacked on scene at the end where he is taken back by his wife needed to be lengthened it just wasnt believable and throughout the film vegas only appears to miss his wife 2 or 3 times br br the film became grotesquely unfunny and plain old well grotesque when sex was mentioned not i add when it was shown on screen gratuitous explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why was not even slightly funny and just made me feel a little bit ill also totally was the inclusion of the character of jeremy picking his nose before showing a close up of the bogey on his finger just him picking his nose would have raised a smile he was a pathetic character and it would have just made him look as low as possible but showing the snot close up was just not needed and was rank br br one scene i did think was hilarious involving sex was vegas in the threesome his conversation with the second bloke just highlighted the fact that threesomes arent always endless ecstasy not that i'd know br br that's about all i can say really i will end with this and this is actually my main critique of the film this is supposed to revive the british film industry it is no 'trainspotting' that is for sure it isn't even a 'love actually' you'd have to have a heart of stone not to throw up at that one and 3 million pounds really could have been put into a better project 'mike basset england manager' was a wonderful little known british comedy and was made for far less than 3 million i only hope that the will learn from 'sex lives of the potato men' and not get so gratuitous in future although the terrible reviews this film is getting are only enhancing the box office
<START> i've never watched a file in a language i don't understand just because i wanted to see the movie and i couldn't find it with english subs i don't know how much i missed but it wasn't much probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together i want to mention to the from germany there's no reason to feel that he when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film like i said i don't understand japanese or at least only the very small amount i came away with from reading the very lengthy novel pro my favorite all time book which i could not put down took the next day off from work just to finish reading i don't know if there's an english dubbed or subbed version but if the film but if there is i'd love to see it the film was incredible in japanese anything better is icing of the cake maegi
<START> this is a weak throw together of just about everything refugees croatia slovenia relations globalization sexual orientation a very big clumsy metaphor about slovenia being at the cross roads between its past which is symbolized by everything virgin becoming queen of the household and its future which is symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being a lesbian and never having kids br br it plays on a rather recent slovenian legend involving a virgin and a forest king assuming the shape of a goat imagery is also based on that legend but unfortunately the treatment is very incoherent weiss seems to think the end justifies the means she can use all kinds of dream like sequences and then pick and choose which ones true and which ones are imaginary how can the ride in the jeep with the forest king be real for all three girls but the scene outside the tent be real only in imaginary the ending just drags on and on i can't believe the movie's runtime is only 98 minutes have i been watching a director's cut without knowing it with the three girls having to look at the camera for about 10 seconds while looking afraid and happy at the same time so obvious br br i never thought i could spot bad acting in a movie whose language i don't understand but it didn't take long to see that is over acting most of the time as if she was playing in a silent movie br br it wasn't so bad as i kept thinking the director was just starting and wanted to capture what she thought her generation was all about on film by doing a half experimental movie until i realized that the director was actually 37 years old when making the movie and that her work is probably serious
<START> this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses his low budget hong kong movies were all fast paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for stallone or chuck norris there is nothing about chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star in his hong kong films chan is never dull with the movies being one rapid fire martial arts sequence after another but the protector is lifeless throughout danny aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together both have been better in worse movies the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so colorless and drab it wouldn't be until the made in canada rumble in the bronx that the west would finally figure out how to make a good jackie chan movie
<START> this film launched my theory about films based on books instead of following the cliche you've read the book now see the film if you are looking for a good book to read try one upon which a movie you like was based because it'll be 10 times better br br i saw this film on its initial release at the national theater in downtown eugene and liked it so much that i stayed to see it again it's a perfect of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors jon voight with what became my favorite book the water is wide by pat conroy br br i can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life two tiny caveats br br 1 the video suffers severely from pan and scan and deserves a letterbox version 2 the title should be restored to the name of the book a reference to one of the most touching enigmatic songs ever written
<START> the story of farewell to the king is intriguing an american deserter i had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the philippines as their desperate escape by raft to borneo is not your classic desertion but no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the japanese nolte's character a sergeant has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed and incredibly no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the japanese right to him but anyway nolte is taken in by a tribe of and becomes their king after defeating another so he's out of the war then the british commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the japanese br br unfortunately nolte's incessant hamming ruins an interesting story instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war now with a tribe of warriors under his command nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe he speaks as if english is almost a foreign language rarely using contractions he makes sweeping gestures when he talks and acts like he is one with nature as if he was raised in the jungle br br there is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the british interacting with nolte and the tribe but nolte's character is never believable it always looks like he's overacting he needed to be a little more of an american soldier and a lot less of a as it is he comes across not as a regal king but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is but that is not the intent of the film as the script has him being admired and trusted by the british commandos there is never any suggestion that the british thought his behavior was strange he is simply viewed by the british as the leader of the tribe thus it always seems that nolte's character isn't fitting in with what's supposed to be happening in the film br br another actor might have done a great job with the role delivered his lines believably and made it an outstanding movie but nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be br br what a waste
<START> i enjoy films of various kinds and qualities whether it's your typical standard hollywood action movie or your oscar season tear jerker movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be enjoyable for me br br in soap girl i received nothing but confusion first we meet maya a massage parlor worker who seems to attract all the customers in the parlor a virgin poet named harry comes in one day and they fall in love after that there are various twists and turns thrown into the plot which seem to lead nowhere br br although many have commented on the controversial issue of an asian prostitute being exploited by the white man keep in mind that this film was made by an asian director who wanted to bring light to the issue but whether he succeeds or not does not matter for the issue at hand is whether the movie is enjoyable or not br br for me soap girl fails to meet the standard i expect from movies it was hard for me to get involved emotionally with this movie given the loose plot and the mediocre acting worse it seems as if the director wanted to make a drama when the tone falls more towards comedy br br a movie such as soap girl which fails to trap me into the magic of cinema will always leave me bored throughout the movie i couldn't help but think what is this really about a movie has to answer that question before it is made if not what you'll end up with is an empty push to captivate the audience br br grade d br br
<START> i was referred to this movie by a friend i had never heard of it but i thought it had christopher so i rented it and come to find out that wasn't christopher it was thomas jane who was great it this film i love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house the characters were great everyone of them and the script was amazing i really wish skip woods would write and direct another movie in my book thursday is the flawless tale of this guy trying to do the wife and kid thing after a shady past but then his old drug dealer buddy shows up and it becomes quite the thursday this is one of my favorite movies and it shows some real potential in thomas jane but this movie is very rare but i have found it in a couple of hollywood video's on vhs so dust off the old vcr and pop in thursday because it gets pee wee's seal of approval
<START> this extremely low budget monster flick centers around a group of mine exploring an abandoned gold mine in order to see if its worth reopening they get trapped after a cave in and find they are at the mercy of a strange slimy creature which seems bent on knocking them off one at a time the word that most came to mind as i watched this movie was the script and acting is terrible the stop motion monster effects were unintentionally funny and since the bulk of the movie takes place underground lighting the sets convincingly looked like a logistical nightmare all that being said however for some reason i felt this movie failed not from lack of effort but maybe from either a lack of budget experience and or lack of creative inspiration the whole thing came off like it was either a college project or a first film made by amateurs i have a certain amount of affection for films like that even when they completely miss the mark i guess what i'm saying is i give it an b for effort and a d for actual results not insultingly bad as some low budget monster movies i've seen but still not worth seeing unless you have a lot of free time on your hands i'm voting it a 4
<START> priscilla queen of the desert is always being trotted out as a masterpiece of australian cinema i found it quite disappointing the lead actors are great terence stamp is aging beautifully guy pearce should do more comedy instead of the dour roles he chooses and i've been a fan of hugo weaving since i saw him play oberon eons ago the cinematography is great but if you've ever been to the australian outback you'd know that the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that they could have shot it on the movie equivalent of a box brownie and it still would have looked spectacular br br so what's my problem well three things first there is not a sympathetic female character in the whole film a woman who has to earn her living shooting ping pong balls out of her privates in a roadside pub deserves our sympathy wife doesn't get much better treatment br br second the scene when they sing i will survive to a group of aboriginals is offensive to try to draw any sort of parallel between the struggles of drag queens and trannies and the almost total destruction of aboriginal culture which is what i assume the scene is supposed to do shows a level of historical understanding worthy of paris hilton br br last of all and the greatest defect of the film is that it just isn't funny enough did stephan elliott actually talk to any drag queens when writing the film anyone who knows a drag queen or three or four knows that most of them have rapier like wits and they're not afraid to use them now i can understand that a lot of drag queen banter probably would have got the film refused classification but elliott should have been able to gather enough fit for the kiddies material to complete his film br br so all in all a waste of a good idea and a great cast
<START> highly suggest not to watch this film 'tv' if not mentally mature enough the film create quite realistic simulation with the steps how they prevent from terrorism if such touch wood incident happened london suppose a lovely and chill city while these kind of wars still going on just wasting the time and money for study and living every time passing around p square the feeling really obvious uncomfortable actually i don't want to vote the scored means nothing just 4 'fill in the blank' br br only and positive thinking cities encourage better economy and investors to keep investing time energies and money
<START> for a norris movie this is pretty tame for an action movie it is kind of dull and as far as predictability goes my friend and i almost had every turn of this movie nailed it was nice that the killer's every moves were not telegraphed by the cliche's of 80's action movies but come on the only non predictable move defies the plot and the set up of the editing mainly it is said rather early on that the killer jack o'halloran whom is one of the few slightly known actors only kills women yet he all of a sudden stops his m o and kills men huh i guess it can be construed and rationalized some way but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women br br yet again i'm sure that there is a reason i e to build suspense but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior br br fans of renegade may enjoy the small cameo by branscombe richmond as victor but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous br br
<START> three ten year old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends them br br while killer kid movies weren't exactly new at the time of this twisted 80's slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film bloody birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities it a fine line between cheesy and creepy but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot there's some strong murder scenes as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasure br br the cast does a fairly good job young stars elizabeth hoy and k c martel deliver some menacing performances while rising star julie brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene veteran star susan strasberg does well as the teacher and jose ferrer has a cameo appearance br br all around this off beat slasher entry isn't bad though it's admittedly not flawless but it is well worth watching for genre fans br br out of
<START> let me begin with a personal note as a film and television buff more on the enjoyment side of life i love what james woods can do and has done and i always love melanie griffith and natasha wagner was very good in this awful miserable stinking true crime essay br br whoever really wrote this film apparently never spent any time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents yes some thieves are junkies but they have very short careers as thieves truly successful thieves are seldom caught because they don't do junk or any drugs before going on a score job br br the james woods character was true to this paradigm in the beginning of this film and then the script fell apart completely he turns into a raging alcoholic lunatic nice work for a high strung guy like woods maybe but not in the least bit believable br br most criminals are lazy if they wanted to work they would work br br these people in this film are beautiful self indulgent drug addled narcissistic losers they couldn't pull off a real score in the real world the real world where a big and beefy security guard who beats the living hell out of a skinny kid as happens in the early scenes of this dog keeps him beat down and doesn't let him up ever br br how many ways did i find to hate this film many even totally vulgar people like most sneak thieves and junkies have a larger vocabulary than these cretins and the 'rip off' scenes with the neo nazi bikers all rednecks ain't neo nazis and those who are neo nazi speed dealers just ain't that dumb br br this film earned a two because natasha wagner was extremely good in her role as rose and because melanie griffith still has 'that something special ' or at least she had it for this brutal and offensively stupid film i'm not one to sing praises of real criminals for any reason but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that they'd all be dead or in jail by act 2 scene 1 watching a lousy zombie movie would be time better spent than this thing and i hate zombies
