<START> directed by jacques tourneur cat people out of the past night of the demon and written by phillip dunne how green was my valley anne of the indies is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie its main character of captain anne providence is based on a real woman pirate anne who actually lived and sailed through 18th century's atlantic br br the film begins with the sea battle where anne's jean peters pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to europe from the south america as a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome french officer pierre la rochelle louis who is taken prisoner anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but it's only till she sets him free when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife molly debra paget with whom he pretty much in love with anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead the pirate movie clichÃ© figure of black also makes his appearance here this time played by thomas gomez br br though anne of the indies probably appears to be no more nor less than a revisiting of pirate movie clichÃ©s it still has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by jacques tourneur 7 10
<START> this film is perfect for over the top cheesy zombie lovers its a film you can laugh at from the acting to the terrible zombie action that being said i gave this a 4 outta 10 for effort cos horror is a hard genre to make going down the list the bad points of this film were as following br br bad make up terrible sound and sound effects really bad continuity cheesy dialogue one song played through the whole film stein couldn't act and in my opinion one of the worst i've seen terrible ending racist moment and stealing simpson's character named br br the good points good costume police officers seemed to have the best acting exp the actors with less lines or small roles did appear to be better good attempt with gore br br i don't wanna bad mouth the film its funny to watch cos of these bad points and i think thats what makes this film ok if it was any better i don't think it would of made any difference but it wouldn't be interesting to see a remake with all the same cast as i believe they have possibly improved over the last 7 years
<START> this was my first gaspar noe movie i've watched and i have to say i was shocked i don't mind gore in generally but this isn't even gore it's real butchering for some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and i mean really disgusting leaving aside these aspects the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant when you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given you can't stop and take a minute to think about it the actors did their job well representing general masks of a few people found at the bottom of a diseased society the movie is full of metaphors but i'll let you figure them out don't watch it if you want to have a lite relaxing time i recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema
<START> by far this is the worst halloween movie ever made the acting is bad except for paul rudd and donald pleasence the girl who played kara forgot her name was ok but overall this movie was basically a big letdown nothing moved the story forward it lacked substance and the scares that made halloween and h20 so good all and all skip this movie it's not worth the price of rental
<START> i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it br br the conversations between and her mother plus and matthew are very touching the community is shown very truthfully and as as it usually is br br although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable br br luckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand br br i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it
<START> i think there's a reason this film never came close to hitting theaters it was probably my neighbors down the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera the acting is very amateur this movie is definitely not something you would want to watch unless you were extremely bored the actors even seem to double as directors and crew members with no professionalism whatsoever should the director s and or actors choose to continue with their endeavor of making movies i would definitely advise them to brush up on their skills and perhaps take a few ok many classes on film making and acting
<START> well now here's the thing for this movie to work you'll have to accept the following a woman who's murdered is alive again at the end of the movie a detective stops interrogating the dead woman's fiancÃ©e because a newspaper reporter asked him not to and that same reporter smitten by a good looking blonde hauled into night court for suspicious behavior winds up getting married to her in exchange for the judge letting her off the hook are you following me on this i can't tell you how many times i paused and rewound the picture to repeat scenes that just didn't make any sense in the end the blonde claudia dell and the reporter richard hemingway remained married but i have no idea how they came to that decision in fact i can't figure out how the film maker came to the decision to make this flick oh i suppose there's some entertainment value here for just the sheer nonsense of it all but it would have been nice if even a couple of the pieces fit still i'm not ready to add this one to my top ten worst list i think that night club scene with the feathered ladies might have saved it but why was it in the movie i just don't know
<START> i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan a culture i know very little about i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint i watched this with someone who didn't read the book and he also enjoyed it they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over you feel for the characters and their plights i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime
<START> i was laughing so hard most of the time i had people glaring at me because they couldn't hear over my laughter i literally fell out of my seat at a specific point br br i'm a bartender and bouncer for a living in the real world note my use of the term real world sadly it always has to come first and whenever i tell someone i play it's usually followed by one of two questions 1 what like d d i played that back in junior high br br 2 really i've been looking or a group forever have room for another very rarely do people not know what d d and gaming are br br that having been said almost every person who watches this movie can get something out of it even if you aren't a gamer chances are there is something in your life you geek out about that can be made fun of in a light hearted way and that alone means you can relate to the hijinx in this flick it's just light hearted happiness in an hour and a half
<START> yes pigeon and coburn are great and it's interesting to watch them although coburn seems rather restrained and dull here it's enjoyable to view seattle victoria and salt lake city of 1970's and the period cars and clothing that's all the good in this boring film the dialog is incredibly bad as is most of the acting ray and sandy's motivations seem forced and unlikely i've seen this training to be a pickpocket routine several times before there's a long build up leading to nothing better to catch an episode of streets of san francisco or one of the many great crime caper movies to name a few there are bedtime story remade as dirty rotten scoundrels the lavender hill mob the grifters paper moon the sting and best of all house of games
<START> if you value your life in any way shape or form you will do yourself a courtesy and pass by this seemingly interesting movie on the dvd rack br br i know what you're thinking i saw the preview and it looked great however buyer beware i fell into the same trap one of my friends expressed certain reluctance to watching this movie but i forced her to sit it out oh how i regret that decision br br like most horror movies the movie starts out cheerfully in a sunny mexican resort where two couples are lured to an ancient mayan ruin by a fellow resort goer upon arrival they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who are all but oblivious to their greeting shouts as if this isn't ominous enough the tour group casts aside large plant growth and declares an unused path consumed by wildlife a perfect route to their destination i guess it wouldn't be much of a movie if they utilized rational decision making and turned around just then but well this wasn't much of a movie anyways br br after some hiking the the resort goer brought a friend stumble upon the ruins and at once their doubts are dispelled by its beauty and history that is until frantic tribal people emerge from the jungle armed with a vengeance for no reason in particular shouting in an indecipherable language since when are brutal verbal assaults assuaged by calm patronizing language don't ask me but nonetheless the cast tries anyway to no avail obviously suddenly the sixth trail member dimitri is punctured with several from the mayans and all hell breaks loose a gunshot finishes the job and the horrified travelers retreat quickly up the ruin br br now if there was ever a plot to this movie it ended here the introduction took at most 20 minutes and it was unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the movie on top of the ruins the now realizes they are stranded by murderous locals and proceed to make countless good decisions one of them being to use a withered rope to lower one of their members into the bowels of the ruin needless to say the adventurer is seriously hurt and then trapped within the ruins and the two girlfriends are gravely injured trying to rescue him br br the rest of the movie continues with no real horror only only blood and gore as displayed when one girl yanks a plant growing within her out gushing of blood and then again when somebody's legs are cut off only to have the same plat from within the girl strangle him later br br my only satisfactions in this movie were observing the very attractive jonathon tucker playing jeff mcintire grow increasingly more frazzled and distressed and sitting long enough to ascertain that almost all of the cast dies a horrible gruesome death their simulated pain seems an adequate compensation for the time suck that was this movie br br supposedly the storyline goes that the ruin is an ancient house of of dangerous spirits with an evil flesh eating plant to ward off and consume unlucky visitors unfortunately i got no such warning from screaming bloodthirsty plants and the only evil thing relating to this movie that i am truly horrified by is the script writer
<START> the scientist charles and his wife or assistant marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient indian cemetery and while cleaning a vase they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being the skeleton man then a military squad commanded by captain leary michael rooker seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that vanished in the jungle they face the skeleton man shooting him while he kills each soldier then the skeleton man goes to a power plant and captain leary explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being br br i bought skeleton man on dvd expecting to see a funny trash but i found an awfully boring annoying and senseless crap with shoots and explosions the imbecile story is totally disconnected and does not make any sense and the military team is composed of imbeciles insisting in shooting the supernatural skeleton man until they are totally slaughtered their leader is also the most stupid with the blow up of an entire facility in the end to destroy the supernatural rip off of the extraterrestrial warrior predator on dvd it is possible to use the fast forward button along the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer my vote is two br br title brazil skeleton man
<START> this is an excellent film full of complexity themes and great dialogue the characters are well drawn with phil the biggest loser of all time br br adam character is the most vicious thing i've seen on screen since alec guinness's portrayal of adolf hitler in 'hitler the last ten days ' br br i just wish they'd all got away with it but without giving too much away there are some situations you just cannot lie your way out of
<START> vidor shines as judith the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family her brother david is so downtrodden by their father that it's a surprise he's able even to tie his shoes rather than asking dad to do it for him br br other reviewers have already outlined the plot so i won't rehash it i will however point out that nan who is pregnant by david is also married to him this is not an out of wedlock pregnancy which would have been horrific by 1921 standards the two are secretly married but father having been paid by david's father tears up their marriage certificate br br death scene with judith in attendance is a truly heart rending experience and highly charged with emotion this scene alone is worth watching the movie for but there's far more to the plot than that why on earth aren't modern movies made with the same attention to the story
<START> this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen it did not left out a single one could imagine about a hollywood so called thriller the protagonist is a loving father a private investigator who is engaged in a special task finding out if a suspected snuff movie is real br br certainly he get's involved deeper deeper run by mexicans sex theatres are his field of investigation as he's searching for the murderers of the woman in the snuff movie assisted by a smart he read a book employee he's catching up with a murderous bondage film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film and what do you expect they are portrayed as the simple evil no need for explanations backgrounds history they are the bad ones and he's the boom killer of the killers end of film is it that bad yes i'm afraid so br br ironically machine the mega pervert who did the killing is even pointing at his ridiculous character in the last scene our hero forces machine to put off his leather mask yep of course he's wearing one and recognizes that machine looks just like the normal 08 15 guy from the street then machine says blablabla i'm not a monster my parents never abused me i had a nice childhood i just love to do what i do br br i just love to kill people yeah sure everybody loves killing people bender it's not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring it's also it's ugly i have to kill these people attitude which makes you sick in one scene our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him but he can't so what does he do he calls the mother of the killed woman says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead the mother cries yes she'd love her child he goes back to the tied killer and slaughters him br br to come to the point this film is breathing the foul air of supporters certainly the police does not play any role in it in a ridiculous form against pornography does not take it's characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo psycho analyze even that would be too much plot br br don't waste your time with this br br
