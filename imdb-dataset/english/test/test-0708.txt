<START> saw this film at the in london where it was showing as part of the bfi's john huston season i wasn't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away in fact the rest of the film continued to give little away no real plot no action no suspense very little drama and except for a short section at the very end no scenery br br the result of lack of all of these features was however a wonderful film i don't fully understand why but i think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect the acting script and most important of all the casting were all spot on and i can't remember walking away from a cinema feeling so good but i still can't work out why i just know that i will be getting the dvd this is one of those films that will i am sure be just as good on the small screen as the cinema experience provided that you can find somewhere quiet to watch it and i will be watching it again soon i will be also interested to find out what my family and friends think of it i'm sure that it will not be everybody's choice but i am convinced that a large number will agree with my view br br 9 out of 10
<START> this is by far the worst version of william shakespeare's tragic masterpiece i have ever seen it seems the filmmakers didn't actually read shakespeare's text no they just took what they wanted from the olivier movie the plot is out of order and slimmed down to its bare necessity yet there is time for the non canon olivier created incest hint between hamlet and queen gertrude could we have had the something rotten in the state of denmark bit instead casting is another issue i understand that the far superior branagh movie had its weak bits robin williams and charlton heston come to mind but this one has very few good moments i do like laertes and polonius but the rest of the cast is stale mel gibson's creepy stubble is irritating and one often wonders if he has any idea what he is saying many of the actors seem to have just memorized the part they know less about what is being said than sophomores in high school br br if you want a version of hamlet check out kenneth branagh's or even olivier to be frank even disney's hamlet is better
<START> the kid at 39 years old russel has a life that most men would envy he has a great job is respected and feared has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money but everything comes at a cost in this case no social life no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone he just needs someone to show him the way br br as i watched the movie i kept wondering why disney didn't pass this film on to miramax not because it's particularly daring or edgy but because it is clearly a movie for adults this is exacerbated by the marketing campaign which is clearly targeting children it is lumped in with trailers for rugrats the movie and pokemon 2000 aren't they passe yet but i quibble br br i was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter rather than the typical male midlife crisis that involves some pathetic sap buying a porsche convertible and acting like a moron willis' character undertakes some serious introspection and takes stock of his life his guide on this journey of self discovery is himself at age 8 they never explain how rusty arrives and frankly i didn't care young innocence and unbridled optimism give him a distinct advantage in the truth he sums up russell's job as an image consultant thusly you teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they aren't in order for a good script to succeed however you need actors to bring it to life not a problem here br br although willis has thrice ignored w c fields' warnings about starring with children or animals he has lucked out once again meshing as well comedically with breslin as he did dramatically with osment willis manages to balance russell's cutthroat traits with vulnerability and confusion without becoming ridiculous breslin meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyone's childhood the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on we also get two bonus performances lily tomlin is great as russell's levelheaded assistant and jean smart is perfect as an insightful charming anchorwoman i loved her in guinevere br br the kid is charming heavy and real and it will appeal to adults of all ages
<START> i got this movie in a bargain bin hoping for an amusingly bad flick boy was i disappointed except for avon you see the movie is indeed horrible but so horrible it isn't even laughable the plot oh wait there is no plot i suppose you could say it's about the main character rising up in the ranks of street fighting at the end of the movie the directors decided to either not make any more sense or more likely died and had a monkey finish directing the movie don't read if you don't want the ending spoiled although the ending doesn't really spoil anything the main character somehow ends up in a room filled with mirrors a la enter the dragon and then gets real angry has stupid flashback and hits a mirror the end br br the only redeeming factor of this movie was scene he's talking to the rival street fighting boss and says something along these lines completely deadpan do not worry about him anymore sir i have killed him in a sophisticated manner i him i hm we went to a disco we was a lot of fun and then i killed him at which point the boss says good work avon you're number 1 and avon says number 1 the scene continues with avon continuing to say over and over the next scene is of a dead avon floating in a pool intelligent i think not br br lastly i own the homeboy version of this movie meaning the title on the box i own is homeboy it shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming this never happens in the movie this man is never in the movie high quality br br note i am new to this reviewing but hell yes i am going to keep it up
<START> i remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's at first it sounded like a great idea a retelling of an american classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day there was a bit a of a back lash over the treatment of the original lone ranger clayton moore the movie studio had threatened legal action if moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger moore was performing at children's hospitals as the lone ranger for sick kids to many americans clayton moore was just that the the one and only lone ranger i had always felt that the studio could have done justice to both the fans and legacy of the lone ranger if moore had been treated better maybe even a cameo in the new movie how ever this was not the case and many of the viewing public stayed away in droves also the story and acting were weak all this added up to a big box office bomb and rightly so i personally i'm glad the studio lost big money after the way the real lone ranger was treated you don't treat an american icon that way
<START> a great animation movie that really gets up to the level of oldies like the lion king br br i went to see this with one of my best belgian friends who also watched the series on tv i was lucky because i didn't know people in belgium were aware of wallace and gromit br br when it started and that good old theme started it started to bring back memories of me watching it when i was 5 br br the humor itself was very funny some nice sitcom style scenes some wordplay or just plain jokes the animation isn't as impressive if you have know the series but it is still fun to watch is you realize how it gets done br br my conclusion not only can it keep my happy and entertained some of the humor can easily appeal to older people so i say go and watch curse of the were rabbit as soon as you can
<START> one of the many silent comedies stan laurel featured in before he teamed with oliver hardy and is a ho hum hokum the story is badly disjointed though this could be because of the modern day edit and the humor itself is not at all inventive br br potential plotlines are started and ignored for instance stan's promise to make fillet de sole pay for what she's done to him never comes to fruition stan's character doesn't seem very centered either but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed of laurel hardy fame so it might be that i was just expecting to see this shortcoming br br i strongly believe that all the silent films should be preserved and viewed and i'm glad this one is still available it's just not a great film
<START> i watch this movie at the start of every summer and it never ceases to amuse me here the jokes are packed in near every line of dialogue giving you more bang than the average simpsons episode some of the jokes fall flat or will only elicit a slight chuckle but others will leave you rolling and then there are those that stick in your brain the audience is now deaf br br the video knows it's a video and makes no pretensions about being anything else it's easy to sit back and let the bombardment of humor begin a good mix of slapstick pop culture and tongue in cheek comedy ensures there's something for everybody i was in sixth grade when i first saw this video and i have to admit i still find it as hilarious now that i've started college br br this is a good movie to watch over the summer much in the way you might watch it's a wonderful life at christmas or ten commandments at easter more than that it's just funny as hell
<START> i have yet to watch 1979 that notoriously cheesy italian take on star wars 1977 but it can't be much worse than this misbegotten piece of junk which suffice it to say makes mel brooks' so so spaceballs 1987 look like a veritable work of art in fact the main reason why galaxina is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady playboy centerfold dorothy stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband before the film had even had its official premiere br br although who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by jamie lee curtis and mariel hemingway plays the title role for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a 27 year journey to some planet or other in fact galaxina is an all purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the blue star cue choral music once they land having said that certainly looks luminous in her white attire and even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess it's not exactly demeaning either br br still it's ironic that for a film which bears her name she is overshadowed by the campy and would be zany antics of her fellow crew members especially the annoying captain cornelius butt which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display here a long eared wing sporting colored guy a pot smoking proverb quoting old and best of all relatively speaking a foul mouthed rock eating hairy alien creature they hold prisoner the villain of the piece is a metal clad non entity who does however have the best laugh in the film when upon hearing the choral music following his every mention of the blue star exclaims what is this s t there is little point in listing the sci fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only lame but obvious incredibly enough a chest busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive hollywood veteran angelo rossitto br br for what it's worth then the scenes shot on the planet they visit which looks more like a western set than a planetary landscape have a yellowish sun like hue and its inhabitants are delicacies on their menu include skin and tonic scotsman on the rocks thigh pies baked alaskan etc not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity the harley davidson and when our heroes escape on the back of it they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their lord god awful indeed
<START> is a burly and uncouth young with a haircut who out a living selling cheap books from a stall in an indoor market he wouldn't appear to have anything in common with the middle aged would be intellectual zhang and yet the two of them wind up in a restaurant together discussing the pro's and of murder the chinese title would perhaps be better translated as it over' if that makes it sound kind of pedestrian don't be misled this film is profusely inventive in its plot and mostly races along at breakneck speed although the pace does flag quite badly towards the end br br if you only know zhang yimou's worthy historical dramas like raise the red lantern and shanghai triad or his more recent martial arts epics hero and house of flying daggers you'll be amazed in fact whichever of his other films you've seen you'll be surprised pleasantly surprised this is far and away his most original most quirky most experimental work it was shot within a couple of weeks on a minimal budget almost entirely on location in beijing and making use of many ordinary in the smaller supporting roles there's even a fleeting cameo by the director himself and mostly with a hand held camera in a jerky hyper kinetic style which is a million miles from the elegant formalism of his best known films br br ok i live in beijing so i find an additional delight in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that i am coming to recognise and relish even though it was shot in '97 and things are changing so rapidly here but i really think this film can be appreciated by anyone i saw it as i have so many other chinese 'comedies' at a movie club that screens sub titled versions of recent chinese films for an almost exclusively audience and it is the only one i can recall where the audience was laughing out loud some non chinese audiences might find it a little too strange a little uncomfortable at times in that it does include some violence and after opening as a breezy offbeat romantic comedy mutates into something much darker in its second half it is however very very funny br br it's also superbly acted by the two leads especially long time zhang yimou collaborator jiang wen who is probably mainland china's foremost film star and has a brooding screen presence reminiscent of a young depardieu or de niro br br watch this film for proof that the chinese have a sense of humour that can translate to other cultures for proof that zhang yimou is far far more than a one trick pony and for a thoroughly good time
<START> when oh when will hollyweird write a decent movie based around computers i cannot believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible story br br no computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying scrolling interface it may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nuts br br as for tracing people the way she did it simply cannot be done that way network security alone would prevent that from happening the key stroke logging was laughable to say the least br br regarding the software that was supposedly being installed no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it has been tested and tested again on a sandbagged system br br but probably the worst possible part of the movie was the virus there is no way that a virus that works on one operating system will work on any other system and as for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of seconds that just beggars belief there is no way that an open remote connection would have the required access that would allow deletion of system files br br i could go on but i can't be bothered br br a porno has a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage
<START> a gang of bandits lead by the shrewd rugged ruthless a perfectly imposing performance by gilbert roland steals 300 000 worth of gold coins during a daring train robbery but untrustworthy member an amusing turn by jose torres makes off with the coins and hides them unfortunately gets killed before he can tell where he stashed the booty so has to join forces with cunning cocky enigmatic bounty hunter the stranger smoothly played by the handsome george hilton and cagey corrupt banker clayton a delightfully weaselly portrayal by 50's teen idol eddie burns to find the coins skillfully directed by enzo g castellari with a clever complex and twist laden script by castellari tito and giovanni a playfully amoral and nihilistic tone everyone keeps double and triple crossing each other with happily greedy abandon a twangy flavorsome spirited score by alessandro and francesco de masi plenty of stirring shoot outs and rousing rough'n'tumble fisticuffs a wickedly sly sense of self mocking humor a steady pace and a real doozy of a surprise ending this giddy and often hilarious feature makes for an inspired send up of sergio leone's the good the bad and the ugly popping up in nifty secondary parts are the luscious stefanie as fiery gal pal marisol as a hard nosed army captain and gerard as flinty lawman lawrence blackman an immensely amusing and enjoyable romp
<START> now any fan will recognise the ingredients big afros topless babes bad fashions and some talk in this case add in a lead who can't act a plot that makes little sense editing by someone with no hands who has been blindfolded and the most god awful fight scenes and you have jackson' not quite bad enough to be good but not good enough to be bad this is a wonderful mess from start to finish i especially loved the endless continuity errors and the lead's white stunt double br br this is so '70s bad far eastern martial arts meets black power that it hurts but boy it hurts so good i am ashamed to admit that i almost enjoyed it
<START> this is perhaps the most ridiculous crap i have ever watched three unconnected stories about completely stupid and random things are occasionally interrupted by a bus and a boring monologue about relationships by a stupid man christ knows why so many people got involved in this highlights green fridge man reading jean paul sartre the slob mans dinner guest and her horse manure hair products a ridiculously unreasonable woman in the third short who suspected a man of foul play just for taking an interest in her generic activities blowers br br i need to use up a few more lines apparently so may as well mention some more stupid things about the film the first film involves a man driving a talking car around and obeying its unreasonable demands for absolutely no apparent reason the only way you would watch this film is if you were blind and had other debilitating defects in your personality and brain it is kind of funny in an ironic way but also extremely wearying like being forced to chew for a very long time on a stained rug
<START> i am a shakespeare lover since childhood i am also a jew merchant of venice is anti semitic through and through no matter how hard scholars and literature lovers try to re interpret it br br in the play shylock is portrayed as demonic and cold hearted and has no forgiveness no warmth no love except for money and cruel revenge whereas the christians are kind moral people his motives in the play revolve around money he plots revenge from the start based on damage caused to his business as well as blind racial hate not noble ideals or hurt racial pride as this movie wants you to believe and this characterization is given to him by shakespeare himself not by the other characters as final proof the happy ending is where the jew loses his money and is forced to convert to christianity br br i acknowledge this and move on it is part of history and i enjoy shakepeare despite this fact therefore i expect a movie based on this play to play it straight i would much rather see the work adapted for its rich language and storytelling without any whitewashing br br but many of the the bard's artful subtleties and playful characters are lost in this movie for example in the last scene where the men discover undercover work as a man who also took away their rings instead of the playful game of words and misunderstandings as the truth reveals itself it becomes a mean spirited game where two bitchy women play cruelly with their soon to be husbands br br so instead we are only left with lovely detailed sets fragments of the rich language with poor reinterpretation poor casting one intense courtroom scene and a controversy br br the truth is i think it would be much easier to identify the anti semitism in the story and move on if it were left as is despite all the whitewashing the makers of this movie pulled out of their hats there is plenty of hatred left only now people can make excuses and pretend the portrayal of jews isn't so bad anymore br br and finally another problem is with most of the actors being miscast pacino is way out of his league and is very uncomfortable with the language not to mention the horribly fake accent fiennes as is charmless and awkward with the language irons is dependable as always but doesn't do much with his role is somewhat ok but unlikeable and covered in bad makeup just like the movie
