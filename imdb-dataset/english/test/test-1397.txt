<START> i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work vivid cinematography and yes wonderfully explicit gore br br this film is no exception however compared to his later films the beyond zombie 2 city of the living dead house by the cemetery etc the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who dunnit amongst the lush hills of italy the scenery is at moments reminiscent of cherished folklore and then immediately contrasted by mud and blood soaked terror shrouded by crumbling ruins the gore in this film is not quite as prevalent and seems restrained compared to fulci's later films however splatter and giallo fans will most likely be satiated by a few close ups of oozing wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film br br overall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great italian horror directors
<START> guy pearce almost looks like flynn and this resemblance is the only one this film can claim nowhere in flynn's autobiography is the klaus reicher character mention the homosexual encounter is speculative fiction and the movie's claims that flynn treated native labor badly are groundless director frank howson hasn't made any memorable films and i find it lame for him to slander flynn to further his unremarkable career br br
<START> i heard legends about this film quotes used so as not to insult films for a while so when i finally got the dvd with it i impatiently started watching it by the end i had to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic ineptly made nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker br br this may be the worst film i've even touched and i used to be associated with troma for a while manson family makes the bottom of troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art house filmwork i could go on and talk about the skeleton of a plot it has the revoltingly bad acting the painful inept directing the sets and props with their dollar ninety nine look i especially loved the plastic toy guns used in the tate murder scene or the nauseating look and feel of this whole bag of garbage i think it was supposed to represent a drug induced hallucination i have absolutely no idea how a drug induced hallucination looks or feels nor do i want to find out but i guess drug junkies with burned out brains will love this film they seem to be the ones who made it i've seen many films from various worst 50 lists traditionally opened by eddie wood's ones and eddie wood would be appalled by the sheer ineptitude and talentless of van webber or whatever his name is i certainly don't want to remember it i've never seen superbabies or its sequel but i strongly wish that manson joined them on imdb's rating fortunately this obscure garbage probably won't be seen by enough viewers to warrant it sufficiently many 1 votes and so much the better
<START> when the net was first being advertised the ads made it look ridiculous then when i saw it it was actually quite good angela bennett sandra bullock spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors then through a series of events her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people and she can't prove that she exists br br some parts of the movie are a little bit far fetched you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie still it's a good look into what the existence of the internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people i do recommend it
<START> showtime falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying and a little south of what i expected months ago when i first heard about eddie murphy and robert di niro teaming up for a comedy overall it was pretty good as real life crime or cops go and plot for that matter it is pretty illogical but duh this is a comedy also while the special effects chases aerial shots and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a movie i found it a bit tiresome and overdone 9 11 sensibilities aside for myself all that pyro techno hyper effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years it seemed a lame substitute for characterization story and engaging emotions i hope the lesser quantity of it in showtime is an indicator of a trend in hollywood a trend downwards of less use of the silly less use of the exploding building br br di niro and murphy are two of my favorites their screen presence and charisma and even their character depth have been a joy to behold for many years that can't be dismissed here they are engaging actors and entertaining and appealing in this movie i can't put my finger on it but perhaps the explosions the excessive fx and all of that diminished the final product perhaps or perhaps it was something else or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn't achieve its highest potential whatever it was showtime was entertaining i probably will buy the dvd when it comes out but i had the vibe that it nonetheless wasn't all it could have been at least not all i had hoped for br br very good movie but not a great movie i gave it an 8 out of 10
<START> there's some nice scenery to look at here if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see any of it i'm a big fan of slice of life movies but these people are just plain bland although there's nothing political here the entire film can be looked at as a political statement in that it shows how communism destroys the individual making everyone the same bland animal that just spends its life sleeping eating and occasionally making love
<START> for a feature film the plot closely follows history or at least historical gossip but then the chinese who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed again and again would never tolerate it otherwise the attention to detail is wonderful especially for anyone who has read sima account in the records of the historian jing ke according to sima qian did indeed make an attempt on shi life at the request of the crown prince of yan before unification sima qian explicitly mentions both the head of general fan and the dagger rolled up into the map as well as the dagger being thrown into the brass column although jing ke is described as no stranger to swordplay he's hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by chen kaige jing ke is indeed this film's weakest link in reality again according to sima qian he was a heavy drinker and put off his visit to for as long as possible spending a good deal of time with the ladies of yan before the crown prince finally ordered him on his way he was in short a human being and was not looking forward to death although he was willing to accept it chen jing ke is afraid of death but not his own he is the classic ruthless killer turned disillusioned pacifist his love or maybe just affection for a woman and pity for several hundred children whom had buried alive not even two thousand years of hostile confucian historians claimed shi huang did this although there is a legend about him burying up to their necks and then beheading them is enough to make this former assassin kill again the melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just plain boring the acting here isn't shabby though not very interesting given the character as for lady zhou in all the numerous stories i've heard about shi huang she's never come up anyway gong li is famous enough for americans to have heard of her thanks to zhang yimou and there needed to be a love interest so here she is it's unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as jing ke's character she's done much better in ju for example at being subtle here she just barely manages presence but all of this is trivial compared to the extraordinary acting of li as himself shi huang is for the chinese rather what milton's satan is for us accepted as a villain but a noble one shi accomplishments radiate an awe all the way across two thousand years into the present and li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity li's performance is enough but the scope of the film is grand although the photography is purposely drab it does feel ancient the score is adequate scarcely moving though very appropriate to the action though i've only seen it once i believe that chen kaige should be given more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him the opening credits are exhilarating if five stars its absolutely average i given three more for li acting and chen kaige as an actor writer and director
<START> the screen play is very bad but there are some action sequences that i really liked i think the image is good better than other romanian movies i liked also how the actors did their jobs
<START> dustin hoffman's debut feature isn't as bad as it's reputed to be a spanish italian co production filmed in italy with the director using the pseudonym dan ash the film is uneven but generally diverting and deals with a plethora of shady characters in search of a 1 000 000 hidden by gangster cesar romero who despite being third billed after elsa and hoffman himself expires before the credit sequence has even rolled br br hoffman's performance obviously is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an amiable klutz an accident prone american treasury agent of sicilian descent named which nobody seems to be able to get right sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain inconspicuous but instead is forever getting into trouble though he ultimately proves surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot foiling the crooks and winning the girl as romero's daughter who's somewhat wasted here br br still the film's best moments are provided by suave gangster riccardo apart from his would be hard boiled persona and the hilarious use of dialect he's flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance in the fulfillment of his various schemes also in view of the story being set in rome it's odd that the police officer investigating the case is a spaniard doubtless an of the co production deal br br along the years i've missed out on hoffman's other italian comedy alfredo alfredo 1972 a number of times i guess mainly because leonard maltin only rates it 1 2 in his movies video guide but then million gets a bomb with pietro germi directing and co starring the luscious stefania sandrelli the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable and i really hope it turns up again on italian tv soon
<START> formulaic slasher film only this one stars three ten year olds all born during a lunar eclipse as the killers nice huh a little bit of gore and a nice nude scene may make this worthwhile for diehard fans of the genre others beware br br 1 2 out of
<START> when i watched this movie in my adolescence i attempted for the soundtrack some bands of the soundtrack i still didn't know however during the film i already noticed her quality u2 blondie police quincy jones sensational soundtrack br br in brazil there is a long time this film didn't pass in tv today he passed in cable tv and i remembered to access the site to do the comment br br the end of the film surprised me a lot but it is what happens in the real life not always what thought about being the ideal it is what happens br br the life brings us a lot of surprises
<START> this movie describes a truly horrific event to be sure but it all falls down from poor performances from all the cast it is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character as all the emotional scenes seem like parodies of themselves for example a character is shot at the start of the movie and you get the clichÃ©d desperate am i gonna make it sergeant yeah it ain't nothing' but it plays out like a sketch from a wayans brothers movie i don't know if they've made the war movie yet or something starring leslie nielsen br br the sergeant played by sean penn reminds me of al bundy from married with children while fox is the greatest self deprecating good guy clichÃ© you can imagine thank god he curses and smokes during it br br his emotional noooo is definitely more suited to comedies like back to the future than so called serious movies such as this br br to their credit some of the main scenes without giving too much away where they actually perform some fairly horrific acts are well done and do make us take the subject matter seriously but that is in spite of not thanks to the acting
<START> i was ten years old when i saw subspecies i instantly had the hots for michael watson and laura tate they really do have some great on screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie i ordered a copy back in 1993 from full moon and i learned this ion and rosa the servants have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the king what most people don't know is that there was an alternate sequence that was supposed to occur in the ending scene michelle and stefan get cornered into a room and michelle has the idea for stefan to make her a vampire to help fight off and her demonic controlled ex friends however for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera another scene in the script that can be confirmed from the original trailer shows stefan drinking blood from a wolf or actually in the trailer you see him coming up with blood on his chin br br this movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood and i have fond memories attached to the characters even though my favorite characters were stefan and michelle i think anders is pure feeling evocative acting so much feeling in his work there
<START> this is probably one of my favorites so far although i have the first one and have seen curse legacy and vs demonic toys the only one better than this one is pm vs dt curse is the worst one in the series than the first one and then its legacy i recommend people to see this and vs dt those ones who say this stinks are so wrong the story is well written and it is a sweet movie this is a classic movie even younger kids can watch and not be as scared when watching the others well this is my review you can call me its easy to know where that came from 101 dalmatians series you can watch it on toon disney at 4 00 a m oh and don't laugh i'm a guy you will see more of my reviews in good time if you want to know why i watch it i'm 12 word of advice have a mental meal i also agree with you 1 but why people like the others is because they're more thrilling than horror and because the puppets are made to look scarier also you can call me
<START> this movie was beyond awful it was a pimple on the a s of the movie industry i know that every movie can't be a hit or for that matter even average but the responsible parties that got together for this epic dud should have been able to see that they had a ticking time bomb on their hands i can't help but think that the cast would get together in between scenes and console each other for being in such a massive heap of dung i can hear it now you getting' paid nope you i understand that this flick was more than likely made on a shoe string budget but even with that taken into account it still could've been better you wait for the appearance of a monster creature and when you finally see it it's a big yawn i'm so mad at myself for spending a 1 07 on this stinker
