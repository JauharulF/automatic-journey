<START> this has to be the greatest practical joke ever i'm amazed that all the other actors kept a straight face i might be wrong but the impression i get from this movie was that they duped frank stallone and joe estevez into acting in this movie that has a budget of just under 40 depending on how much those bats and spray painted equipment cost create the most incoherent movie ever created and sit back and laugh at the fact that joe estevez and frank stallone weren't in on the joke br br if by some chance they weren't kidding and they legitimately tried to make a real movie then i feel sorry for everyone involved in the creation i've had quite a love affair with cheesy movies but this movie is so bad i can hardly watch it they repeat pointless special effects so many times that it's obvious they were just trying to cover up the fact that they only shot 30 minutes of footage if i were forced to watch this movie on repeat i would bludgeon myself unconscious with my own hands after about one and a half times through no offense to the great frank stallone but i would rather watch sylvester teach a class for 10 hours than watch that movie ever again
<START> this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind one knows it's going to about a mute one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment br br well forget it the movie starts with a little black humour and then gets started from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of moscow all right it must be said the unexpected twists are expected and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder but this movie doesn't let you go br br it's like the old gangster movies but then without any glamour at all and in russia and that's one of the most important aspects of this movie it's situated in russia this does have a great impact on the movie according to me it makes it better everything becomes simple and basic life is without nonsense this could be a great potential for more movies in the future gangster movies about the russian mafia br br it is a beautifull and terrifying movie it's horror but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute one last advice don't look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well
<START> i agree with so many of the other reviewers here this was a great film and an even better novel by robert fish unfortunately i believe the author died before he could see this film made the performances are all top rate with the three principles john glover ben cross and veronica seemingly made for their roles the exteriors both in europe and israel seem very authentic and the 4 hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story fortunately i did tape this when it was on television and have enjoyed watching it ever since i can say unhesitatingly that it holds up even to this day i gave it a rating of 10 if you haven't read the book you should really find a copy this would be an outstanding film to release on dvd with extras that could easily include interviews from the cast
<START> the best bond game made of all systems it was made of the best bond movie of all time if you don't have the game goldeneye you should rent it and if you don't have the movie goldeneye you should rent it also to better understand the game the best bond game of all
<START> to be i used to like this show and watch it regularly but now thank god i don't understand why did i watch it sex and the city is one of the most pointless and insulting tv shows i've ever seen i really don't get the point of this show despite of trying people are saying that sex and the city is funny in what way by cursing all the time talking about vibrators and the size of the penis give me a break br br i don't understand the plot we have four girls who are trying to find a perfect man by sleeping with every dork who comes around and this show is all about four spoiled chicks who are sleeping with every man in the city but in the end they admit the best pleasure comes out of the penis vibrators and yeah the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every relationship if you can have a good sex you're a good husband or wife it doesn't matter if you want to be loyal and having a good heart the size does matter br br the biggest problem is also bad acting the four main actresses sarah jessica parker kim cynthia nixon and kristin davis are so bad and unconvincing that it makes me sick just watching this show parker is just screaming and complaining all the time is showing her old boobs and saying the f word all the time davis delivers her smile and nothing else and nixon acts like she is bored all the time and yes men are sex hungry pigs in this show but judging by this show women are not much better this show is insulting for men and women the women are shown so primitive and emotionless like they don't have any heart just hunger for sex it's insulting for everyone br br sex and the city is one of the worst tv shows and i'm glad that the show ended because it delivers bad acting and pointless stories the whole world is not all about sex and vibrators
<START> what a waste of a film once again the film industry does not trust to make a film that could have been just about the man's ideas there is virtually nothing on his theories or evolution instead the most boring story of home life and relationship with one daughter a ponderous script great liberties taken with darwin's life dialogue given to his character that i find hard to believe he would have voiced darwin never gave up his believe in a higher power he may not quite rightly have believed in the established christian idea of god but was not an atheist which this film implies what would have been a riveting and much better film is if they had started with the publication of on the origin of species and constructed a story of the great revolution that entailed and of an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides instead we got a plodding boring drama mostly made up a great injustice
<START> only few can understand character and to do that u most likely are inborn to see both sides of life and to face this reality is very hard and can lead some few to bad acts like character does but for such sad and real reasons that his intentions were good in the sense that the intention to save another from physical or mental in this case pain over long time and it is really sad how mostly everyone in this movie makes mistakes in it but the one character to make one through good intentions is killed by it the lesson of this movie is for the unique person to see realize face and make right of the real life situation u see and to make right or inspire one who can make right of a wrong situation but before that u have to see both sides of something and rationalize it for the sake of long peace and tranquility of all human life aka don't be ignorant
<START> well done melodrama that tells the story of sally tomboy dancer in the circus raised by sideshow performer played by w c fields he of the top hat little mustache checkered pants and proficiency as juggler pickpocket and runner of carnival con games like three card monte and the old shell game has raised sally who worships him as her real father since sally's mother kicked out of her home by her father a judge when she married a circus man died and left sally orphaned sally is feisty and loyal to no matter what he gets up to but seems to feel a bit of guilt over keeping her in the circus instead of with her own family all these years when they end up performing in a carnival in the town where her wealthy grandparents live uses the opportunity to investigate sally's real family with the idea that he may restore her to them but grandfather the judge takes an immediate disliking to sally 'cause he doesn't like a show girl what a stern narrow minded man he is a real piece of work that guy and meanwhile sally is busy being pursued by a handsome and rich young man son of the man who helped grandpa get his riches br br this is a very good film with a few laughs here and there and a sort of odd editing style i don't know how to describe this other than it shows long shots then sort of jumps back a few seconds or changes angle suddenly as a close up is shown carol dempster who plays sally is delightful here quite cute and comical in her performance w c fields even without his famous voice is very funny just the way he moves and his amusing comical reactions to things like a small dog seen in one funny scene we even see him juggling briefly in this i love the few peeks at the old fashioned circus and carnival that is shown here the print of this featured on the dvd is very nice looking tinted a light sepia tone and the piano score for this is really excellent performed by philip based on the original cue sheets
<START> well don't bother this film looks so tired the acting is so old fashioned and the plot and characters so drab that it should be studied instead of watched it is really a horrible waste of film stereotypes clichÃ©s nonsense and amateurish film making i watched it in unbelievable awe with my mouth wide open how could such a film be made and more interestingly how could anyone find it funny or watchable old tired sloppy a junior high skit at best there is nothing watchable there except for a study of very ancient film not good film just ancient this is not abbott and costello or laurel and hardy this is nonsense the acting is so bad that maybe it is worth it to watch just for the laugh some films are so bad that they are good but this one goes all the way around the corner and back to bad again
<START> while disney have been the animation studio for the past 70 years there have always been rivals to their supremacy when this review was written in 2009 for example companies like dreamworks and to a lesser extent warner brothers and were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the disney dominance back in the beginning in that late '30s and early '40s heyday when disney was serving cinematic like snow white dumbo and fantasia the competition was provided by brothers dave and max fleischer despite releasing two very commendable films they never quite cornered the market Â many attribute their downfall to the commercial failure of mr bug goes to town released the same week as the attack on pearl harbour which gave the american public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon that this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travesty br br in a patch of overgrown garden in the city a bunch of bugs are in dire danger humans use the land as a shortcut litter and cigars and other hazards right on top of the homes as they go honey shop owner mr bumble voiced by jack mercer fears that the future is bleak and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter honey voiced by pauline in more secure surroundings a highly unscrupulous creature bagley c beetle voiced by pierce offers to provide her a safer place to live if she will accept his hand in marriage but honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart the cheerful and optimistic voiced by stan freed believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better but is left looking foolish when bagley beetle and his pair of comical sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devious end only at the very end as their patch becomes the foundation for a huge new skyscraper do the bugs switch loyalty back to as they look to him to lead them a new safe home away from the destructive influence of humans br br what really works in this film is the delightful characterisation Â all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal the bumbling villains swat the fly and smack the mosquito hilarious names if you stop to think about it are particularly memorable equally admirable is the storytelling drive Â even the youngest of children can enjoy this story while at the same time it skillfully conveys a message for older audiences about the way human carelessness can impact upon the survival of wildlife time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film and when viewing it the audience needs to accept and forgive these occasional signs of general age and wear but on the whole mr bug goes to town is an accomplished funny and very slickly presented animation with a worthy message to boot
<START> this is a really mediocre film in the vein of buckaroo banzai the cast runs around like mad max wannabes and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience wheeler nicholson is one of the those guilty pleasure actresses you are delighted to stumble across in films but she isn't worth the price of rental space maggot starts an electrical fire and burns a vote of 4
<START> until i saw this film life is beautiful was my favourite film of all time this film is everything a great film should be great script unsurpassed acting and direction that neither approaches the sentimentalism the subject tempts nor leaves it without the emotional impact it demands this film contains the taste that could not come from hollywood and lacks the that would come from france a wonderful movie even above the calibre i have come to expect when i see the handmade films logo come up i need not go into detail as the previous posts encompass everything why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet
<START> this movie was never intended as a big budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy it probably won't change your life but it is certainly charming and engaging br br clifton webb plays a curmudgeon that's certainly not new who has a tv however his ratings are failing and he is worried about cancellation so he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids as he and his wife have none of their own so he volunteers as a and regrets doing this almost immediately remember he is a curmudgeon and doesn't particularly like kids to make things worse one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy no matter how indifferently he acts towards the kid the child just wants to spend time with him the kid is cute and nearly steals the show all by himself br br what happens next and the twists and turns of the movie are something you'll just have to find out for yourself understand that this is a light cute and yet not cloying movie you'll probably enjoy
<START> critics claim that this film is one of the worst films ever watchers also claim the same but there is a flip side to that coin they are wrong very wrong it's the most clever film i've seen in ages br br from beginning till end you see a story thats unrealistic a story that reflexes the real world this film is like a mirror you see yourself in another way that people see you to really understand the directors point of view you have to see it another time br br when you see this film try to understand the story and watch the background listen to the lyrics of the music and smell the industrial complexes br br this film is one of a kind you'll hate it most people do or you'll love it and understand it completely br br ernest hemmingway once said 'the world is a fine place and worth fighting for' i agree with the second part
<START> dead man walking is one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen i find it hard to believe that anyone after having seen the movie could feel indifferent about the film or its message tim robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on the viewers but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty whether it is right to murder a murderer or not i have always known where i stand in this question even as a child and this movie despite the fact that it does not really take any sides made me even surer in my conviction that it can never be right to murder anyone br br sean penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of matthew his nomination for an academy award was very well deserved even if nicolas cage does a great job in leaving las vegas i would have been happier if penn had won the award susan sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the academy award she won and tim robbins certainly deserves the vote i have given this film 9 10
