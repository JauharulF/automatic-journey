<START> i will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from me br br the film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process i'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made br br its also the most historically inaccurate film in existence 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place br br characters are unlikeable design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to it br br and the ending is probably the worst of it its supposed to be thought provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is what the f k is going on br br i'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes avoid this film at all cost and choose a sci fi movie that isn't stuck up its own
<START> if extreme activities and i don't mean the hollywood ones like x games and the people who pursue them interest you then seek this doc out br br this is one of those truth is stranger than fiction tales of donald obsession to prove himself against great odds those odds were stacked by mother nature the media and his own mind it is also about a time lost to us although it was only 40 years ago br br the filmmakers have done a great job in gathering a wide range of material to tell his story and the story of the great race that consumed him br br i couldn't help but to think about timothy and the apollo astronauts in the 2 great docs grizzly man and in the shadow of the moon while experiencing you don't simply watch this story br br if you live in a big city buy it or rent it it is worth the effort to find i had to travel 100 miles to l a to buy it and i am glad i did
<START> ok we have a film that some are calling one of the best movies ever but i'm sitting here thinking hell the f the storys sux which there is no story the is quite plain artisticly nothing great and the acting is nothing real out standing so if you want to pretend to be arty say you like it but if you have a real view say you don't like it or if you did explain why
<START> someone on these boards has predicated that the whole thing is being dreamed by the best friend of the protagonist albeit a friend he hasn't seen for some 20 years i'm reluctant to dismiss this out of hand but it does raise some viable questions why would a telephone engineer or a shoe salesman or butcher for that matter want to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend it in the process with a set of equally mythical supporting characters with an imagination that good the friend should be writing not dreaming dream or not someone and the obvious candidate is director paolo has created a very watchable world in which tony makes stillness a fine art we are asked to believe that forty something la the mafia some years prior to our meeting him and as penance he is a virtual prisoner in a small swiss hotel from which each week he drives to a local bank with a suitcase containing nine mill large in used notes other than this weekly trip he is free to do as he likes and what he likes to do is smoke play cards with a man who cheats and a wife who reminds the husband how far they have fallen socially and ignore the friendly overtures of olivia magnani who has spent two years trying to get a smile and or a 'good out of him for reasons best known to himself and which are inconsistent with a man who has no interest in anything or anyone spends a certain amount of time every day applying a stethoscope to the wall of his bedroom and listening to the private conversations of his card playing partners eventually he does respond to magnani he has to do so or they would be no film this is plot the one about destry who never wears a gun or sean duke wayne the 'quiet man' who refuses to rise to provocation and fight until the obligatory scene where the gun is strapped on and the fists cocked but instead of himself with a polite come he removes 100 000 from the suitcase and buys her a car the final inconsistency occurs when magnani tells him she will pick him up the following day at 4 pm in her car and they will drive into the mountains to celebrate his birthday we've established that she lives locally so why she is then seen driving from somewhere miles away ignoring a police roadblock to drive off the road and overturn the car is anyone's guess this inconsistencies apart this remains a fine piece of film making with an excellent lead performance and a very good supporting one
<START> if it were possible i would have given this sorry excuse for a movie a zero star it was by far the worse i have ever seen it was as if it were a home movie that some bored highschoolers decided to make as a joke the acting was horrific the actors didn't even react to the fact that they were being murdered br br honestly i bought this movie by mistake the spanish title said jeepers creepers 3 so i thought hmm maybe it'll be ok wrong it was honestly the worst ever i didn't get past 20 minutes of the stupid movie i skipped through chapters and nothing interesting ever seemed to happen br br the cameramen were also terrible it was like a home movie i would never recommend anyone to watch this terrible terrible moronic movie
<START> if you're looking for a kung fu action movie look elsewhere while there are fighting scenes the film revolves around its provincial protagonist who struggles to find her way in americanized canton unlike most kung fu comedies the action scenes are used to reinforce the comedy instead of the other way around br br cheung is a statement about the farcical nature of kung fu movies where the stars always seem to find some reason to fight instead of some grand drama about honor and respect minor misunderstandings cause the characters to yell at each other and start beating each other up br br my young auntie as it's known in the west is the story of cheng tai nun played by kara hui who is a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to keep his from falling into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother after he dies she moves to canton to live with her nephew played by director lau kar leung and his son ah tao played by hsiao ho br br the basis of the irony is that although cheng is the same age as ah tao her manner is more akin to her status as his step great aunt while ah tao speaks english extremely poorly plays the guitar and goes to costume parties cheng utterly fails when she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in canton complete with makeup revealing gowns high heels and dance scenes br br what makes this movie great is its realization lau kar leung is perhaps one of the greatest if not the greatest director of his generation in hong kong and kara hui won best actress at the first hong kong film awards in 1982 also this is arguably hsiao ho's finest performance his chemistry with hui is remarkable and although he went on to have a storied career in kung fu comedies often working alongside sammo hung he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy as the romantic tension and intrigue build in the second half of the movie his entire countenance changes no longer does he easily through life without a care in the world he becomes the straight man and his cohorts the kramer elaine and george br br my one complaint is how suddenly the comedic aspects of the film die off during the conclusion the film transitions from outright farce to dramatic intrigue with little but a change in incidental music but there is a certain symmetry in it the film begins focused on the intrigue focused more on lau kar leung's character and it ends that way too but the final scene returns to the movie's comedic roots giving conclusion to both aspects of the film
<START> nurse betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately it was funny but it also had many touching moments freeman rock kinnear the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real the story took such twist turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch if you're sick of the recent formula movies see nurse betty for something completely different go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out
<START> love is a many thing is set in hong kong in 1949 50 and tells the story of the relationship between mark elliott a white american journalist and han a half chinese half european doctor this story of a mixed race love affair was quite a daring theme for the fifties and as it often did hollywood tried to soften the blow by casting a white actress as the supposedly non caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man something that would be regarded as politically incorrect today but was quite acceptable then think for example of the casting of ava gardner in show boat or natalie wood in west side story the setting of the story in a british colony was also perhaps a way of exploring racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in america loses her job in a hong kong hospital because her british superiors take exception to the fact that she is dating a white man whom she is unable to marry because his estranged wife will not grant him a divorce as was sometimes the case european colonialism was made the whipping boy for some of america's own failings imagine the that would have been unleashed had a similar film been made about a black or mixed race woman doctor in a hospital in alabama br br besides racial issues the film also raises questions of international politics referring to both the communist seizure of power in china and the outbreak of the korean war han was a real person and a well known author of the period in reality she tended to support communist regime but here she is shown as firmly anti communist this is not however primarily an issue movie about either or politics but rather a romance a good example of what would have been known at the time as a woman's picture such films although mostly made by male directors were mostly aimed at female audiences they dealt with love and romance often unhappy romance from the woman's point of view and had a strong female character in the leading role the genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances earlier examples were normally in monochrome but by the fifties they generally as here used lush sumptuous colour br br although a chinese or eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role jennifer jones does a very good job as i found william holden as mark rather uncharismatic but this does not matter much as is very much the dominant figure she is screen much more than mark and the film examines her family and professional life much more than it does his although jennifer was still strikingly beautiful she was in her mid thirties rather older than most romantic heroines of films of this period holden was about the same age unusually for the fifties when boy meets girl often meant older man meets girl br br the film is not particularly profound but is well made with some attractive photography particularly of hong kong itself reflecting the growing trend in the fifties for shooting on location rather than on studio sets seldom can hong kong have looked so beautiful the view from a hill overlooking the city takes on a special meaning as this is where and mark go for their romantic assignments the overall mood is one of poignant doomed romance a mood heightened by the atmospheric photography and the musical score including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written 7 10
<START> hercules wound up falling into the same category as many promising television productions that could have been a really great classic only to become a sad joke br br i really like kevin sorbo and his supporting cast but i didn't care for the direction the show took since their movie equivalents either i believe the show would have had a much more successful run if they had kept the same format they did for the movies br br i watched in the beginning and lost interest along the way i did encounter the odd episode afterwards but my attention span towards it was lucky to make it to commercial break
<START> barf yuk yuk disgusting puke city worst piece of junk ever made sick weird horrible enough said hold your nose don't eat after seeing this sick demented garbage pail of a movie you won't be able to eat your food for a week but maybe that's good a new diet has been invented go to see this vomit inducing film get sick to your stomach and you will be so turned off by the whole mess that you can't eat for at least a week and you drop about 15 pounds br br me me lay with a name like this it's really amazing that she doesn't have a cult fan following she rates as the worst actress ever her films make ed woods look like gone with the wind this movie rates a minus 10
<START> i love everything about family guy br br my favourite characters in family are brian and and i like the episodes when it mainly features them such as road to rhode island season 2 as they interact very well the comments they make just have me in stitches peter's behaviour is also very funny as some of the things he does are just so brilliant they're retarded the voice acting is excellent especially seth as he provides the voices for half of the griffin family as well as their perverted neighbour glenn quagmire and how he manages this range particularly with singing i just don't know he deserves his two emmy's for providing the voice of evil baby genius adam west also steals the show with his funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of what i like about chris voiced by seth green is the things he says show that he takes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense br br the only thing i have found annoying is that in the uk fox has decided to change the seasons to increase dvd sales which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing br br if you enjoy family guy then i would thoroughly recommend seth other project american dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious
<START> talented screenwriter alvin sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in los angeles despite mom's flighty behavior apart from several good sequences i didn't quite buy susan sarandon as a flake she's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil may care lady and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent natalie portman fares much better as her kid and yet there's a creepy aloofness to her work and some of her scenes such as the one where she asks a boy to strip are misguided and uncomfortable to watch certainly not an incompetent piece anywhere but here does have moments that work but it isn't an embraceable film nor has it proved to be an important one from
<START> i resisted watching 15 park avenue despite of recommendations the movie as a clichÃ©d topic of extreme emotional dramas and over the top acting br br once in a while movies like 15 park avenue come by and sweep you off your feet br br the movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie the impeccable character development just right amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all br br i have a renewed respect for konkana sen sharma who convincingly plays the schizophrenic she beats expectation yet again after page 3 and mr mrs iyer prof role is very well developed and shabana does full justice to the character rahul shefali chaya waheeda rehman add incredible flavor to the movie br br i define shower moments as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you ponder over in your shower endlessly till your wife girlfriend mom bangs at the door delivers many shower moments especially the conversation between anjali and her mother where the mother is cautious when talking to anjali about her thoughts it immediately brings out personality to the audience br br the end is a very bold statement by the director probably too westernized for the indian audience yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a good to a great status
<START> 'the 4th is a decidedly mediocre film starring juliette lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor jane lewis has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother and per agreement with the landlord gets a ridiculously low renting rate her boyfriend william hurt as a creepy weather man wants her to move in with him but she wants her own space so she moves in and weird stuff starts happening and because this is a b grade horror flick there's a dumb not to be found in reality reason why as the none too intriguing jane keeps trying to tell others her boyfriend the police coworkers what's going on everybody thinks she's losing it so of course she has to face the problem the lunatic living right below her alone neither scary nor interesting the movie's single saving grace is lewis she's a very fine actress but poorly used here which is not to say she isn't the best thing about this flick because she is she has feral charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen of the silicone bimbos that routinely populate this type of movie this type of movie though is not worthy of her which is ironic given that she's probably the only reason anyone would see it
<START> brett piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film experts it is low budget but fun and the leading lady is very sexy i wish i could see more of irene joseph good viewing fun i bought the dvd and enjoyed it the special effects are stop motion animation and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today i always enjoy brett piper movies and if you liked this i recommend bite me screaming dead and anything else he has done i look forward to seeing more of his work and well as more of ms joseph i simply cannot see why this woman hasn't been in more movies as her acting is excellent
