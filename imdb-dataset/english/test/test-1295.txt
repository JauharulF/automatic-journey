<START> for those of you unfamiliar with sims he is of course the definitive scrooge of all them christmas carol movies me i guess i'm really bad i haven't actually seen the darn thing i guess those who have seen christmas carol and so used to his character might find the bells of st trinians rather surprising you see in this movie sims has two roles one he plays a heavy better and in the other he's in drag as a headmistress for a private girl's school so once you get that through your thick skull this movie offers plenty of delights the plot is deals with the way the school tries to make some desperately needed money through a horse race it's actually a little more complicated for the small kids to handle but i think they would be preoccupied with their antics and with the horses to really notice the adults too might get tripped over all the thick accents being thrown around as well but again the story is reasonably light the action crazy and frenetic for one to really notice ps the kids all look like they come from the eloise school of cuteness
<START> as an avid reader of clive barker i truly anticipated this film prior to it's release i was not let down is a horse of a different color rich in the underlying decay of western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his world of unprecedented horror yet showing us the other side of the coin here the monsters are the hideously beautiful beings while the humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self indulgence we soon learn that we were wrong all along by far my favorite performance by the often under used craig sheffer and the added bonus of david cronenberg as decker is a cast best seen then believed the monsters are portrayed flawlessly by a bevy of english creature masters whom many also brought the to life in hellraiser including pinhead himself doug bradley is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre and anyone who needs just a little something more out of their horror story this is clive barker at his finest
<START> i'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people the series started off very good and after the first season it wasn't that good br br people tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end this is not good to do you should look at the total not the end result it is sad that a lot of the usual characters died but damn we had a lot of nice new characters br br please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series the plot please do understand that i didn't like it when boone died when died but well it needs to be done can you imagine that everyone keeps living the whole series when they are in a lot of danger all the time come on face it if they didn't die they would be invincible in this way you will always keep the tension will he survive will he die i do realize that people attach their selves to characters i do that too my favorite character was the one who could get into every computer he wanted he was the one who was mysterious he could do things with the computer no one else could do br br i wish to make one statement to all the people who vote negative does a series which started so good deserve to have such low rating should we look at the final season instead of the total should we not see how good the series was when it started should we not see how much we enjoyed it
<START> this movie is the proverbial 80s flick that shows the viewer that as long as he or she tries at something they can be better than the pros the main character doug showed off his skills in flying a cessna aircraft which somehow equated to being fully capable of flying a jet aircraft and being able to kill people we all would like to have a few million dollars to play with maybe make a good investment donate buy a few things but the directors of this movie decided to make iron eagle not once not twice not even three times yes four times the thing to look most forward to are the multitude 'hollywood in this movie just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy end sequence there's another cheesy end sequence then another definitely a movie one must watch to believe and maybe own just to remind oneself of how awesome the 80s must have been
<START> despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco this film doesn't quite reach the level of joe d'amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy the author of the original book emmanuelle the joys of a woman emmanuelle directed and had a role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations her boyfriend played by zombie's al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married maria drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by herself despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye i can see you better naked the film shambles along up until the less than spectacular finale much like d'amato's emanuelle and the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but don't get your hopes up there's no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter just a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldn't help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by
<START> two years after this movie was made the juror came out don't waste your time on this one see the juror instead the juror is essentially the same story as trial by jury with better acting better directing and a far more gripping aura about it william hurt was not believable as a cop gone bad and armand assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit you didn't become involved enough with character to be that upset by what was happening to her also the way in which she interacted with the jury wasn't compelling or interesting in any way kathleen role as a hooker killer wasn't fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot
<START> i wanted to love this movie everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable if not groundbreaking film it was set in southern france good looking and recognizable actors led the cast and i really admired the vibrant african costumes the proverbs and music despite all this i didn't love it movies are supposed to convey their meaning at the first viewing but secret laughter doesn't do that and matthew as played by long and firth both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish i used fish' deliberately because it was one of a few too few strong lines and moments sprinkled throughout the film another winner was when catches matthew snooping around her apartment he finds a book of hers with her first name written on it and says your name is i never knew then he insists that she call him by his christian name i watched this scene intently as matthew asked over and over to say my name realizing that up until that moment they always called each other by their last names i thought this was a turning point for the film and expected that it get better it didn't why do and matthew always seem to stand at ten paces even in that say my name scene what does matthew like about aside from her obvious beauty and why would a sensible woman like fall for a comic book writer who regards his marriage as something he can put on hold when a beautiful exotic comes along and i'd like to add that it was a little hard for me to get behind a romance built on adultery yes jenny is a vicious harpy but if i were in her shoes but i'd probably match her cruella tactics to stop my husband from straying believe it the story hints at painful past but never fully explores it some critics say firth seemed a little awkward here and i agree for goodness sake the actor summoned more palpable longing and passion as that early 19th century snob mr darcy and while wearing those hideous britches as for long who did shine in 'love jones' there were times when she seemed to concentrate more on her accent than playing her character even so there were many moments Â the 'say my name' scene among them Â when she was in total control and came across really well yet 'secret is not without its redeeming qualities and i've found that it grew on me with more viewings nene was well portrayed as supportive and well meaning even if she doesn't fully understand attraction to matthew i absolutely loved it when nene faced off with mama in those dueling proverbs scenes my husband liked it and usually he's the first to sigh and throw insults at the screen if he doesn't like what is going on he even chuckled at the scene when sammy asked matthew some very frank questions about sex so there you have it 'secret was good enough to entertain an avowed curmudgeon like my hubby but an avid moviegoer like myself will need more than one viewing to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey
<START> i generally like sion work but this movie was completely retarded but sadly not retarded enough to make it entertainingly retarded i just sat mouth agape wondering when it would end the plot makes only a whisper of sense i think it was intended to be campy i mean haunted hair extensions how could it not be but the humor such as it was fell flat not funny not scary not gory i would say perhaps was a hired hand on this project but he appears to have written this boring trash as well i still need to fill a couple more lines what else is there to say i suppose i could finish by saying better luck next time san
<START> my reaction to this remake of the italian job is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when i saw it this is the first movie i saw after i had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for money was still tight but i no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills or eating lunch and the sense of relief and gratitude i was feeling at the time was enormous in consequence my enjoyment of italian job was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth br br still i picked it up used on dvd a few weeks ago and watched it again and i still enjoyed it immensely i have never seen the original though i have heard it is an absolute classic but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes br br what initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack imo don davis writes some of the most supple textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around ij opens with a sly witty pulsing arrangement that combines strings guitar brush work and quiet moments it won me over completely from the opening seconds and the whole movie is like this i haven't heard this kind of ringing pulsing soundtrack music since stewart copeland left the police and started doing soundtracks for movies like rumble fish there are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here along with some pop song remakes that range from all right to inspired for people to whom the soundtrack is important this movie is a delight br br on to the movie i can take or leave mark wahlberg but he's okay here as the leading man and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well he's the weakest major actor in the film but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong especially donald sutherland in a bit part mos def jason ed norton seth green and charlize theron all turn in solid fat free performances norton seems to mostly be phoning it in rumor has it that he didn't really want to be in the film but he's still a natural even at 1 2 power my one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character wrench who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor his part seems to be shoehorned into the movie and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the late walk on nature of the character if i were a cynical sort i would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a role nah never happen br br production values camera work stunts plot everything cooks along quite nicely and gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly with the exception of the wrench character see above br br the dialog has a nice light touch that rewards your indulgence and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way my favorite moment when norton's character tells wahlberg's character that he's just lost the element of surprise wahlberg proceeds to cold cock norton with a right cross and then asks him were you surprised hmmm maybe you had to be there br br of course the movie requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief to work but if you just relax and go along with it and don't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate la traffic via a laptop etc you'll have a fun ride br br the italian job it's lightweight summer fluff but it's very good for what it is and it doesn't try to be anything else it isn't good enough for an 8 but i'd give it a 7 5
<START> this movie exemplifies a certain brand of comedy horror of a strictly adult kind but quite different to the troma movies with which it shares certain qualities the humour is rough and ready but fast and furious if the idea of hideous dolls with evil powers and twisted minds don't make you shrug with boredom reach for the six pack of beer and enjoy the best chucky film yet
<START> i've never been compelled to write a review about anything but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something first people just have to get over the fact that the voices are different once you watch an episode it never really comes to mind ever again the humor is original and while yes some jokes do carry over from the movie they are delivered fresh some of it is even reminiscent of shrek self referential humor a lot of these jokes seem aimed at teens or original fans of the movie as much as tweens and younger patrick warburton and eartha kitt are both hilarious as they reprise their roles as and and their annie award nominations were well warranted br br this show takes some time to love to really get in the groove of things so to speak if you ignore the horrible theme song which really shouldn't warrant that much in the way of how you judge a show since it's only 30 seconds of the overall product this show is laugh out loud hilarity and doesn't lose any of the emperor's new groove spirit
<START> like the first one the team of jackass are back to try to kill themselves with whatever manner they see fit either it's fitting yourself in a tractor tyre and rolling down a slope or getting yourself deliberately smashed by a bull or something even worse br br the first one was crazy and that's how you can describe it it was also really hard laughing film but this one is completely nuts it's got even more dangerous stunts and even harder laughs so i think watching dumb idiots getting themselves killed is gonna be the funniest thing this week br br so before borat comes out i shall laugh my a out
<START> but of course i was wrong br br now i never expected to like the first movie i'm not sure what's up with disney's marketing group but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated film ends up turning me off as too childish or silly or stupid and yet the movies themselves are usually anything but and no movie looked worse to me in the trailers than the emperor's new groove which is why i was quite surprised to actually find myself quite enjoying that film when i finally broke down and saw it i entered with zero expectations and came out pleasantly entertained br br despite disney's track record with direct to video sequels i had nonetheless hoped for a better experience with here but in the end i was nothing but disappointed and unfortunately not exactly surprised that i felt that way there's almost no humor targeted towards adults the original songs are uninspired and sickly cute the animation while not bad still doesn't come close to emperor which was no lion king to start with br br the main plot as such is astoundingly minor and is comprised mainly of a sequence of mini plot flashbacks in fact the while thing felt more like a sequence of pilot episodes for a saturday morning cartoon series than a well conceived single entity br br david spade gets about four lines throughout the entire movie and there isn't exactly a lot of john goodman either so overall we're just left with far too much of patrick warburton's who was entertaining as a secondary character in the first movie but is completely inappropriate as the main lead here br br although kids might find it somewhat fun the only thing new groove managed to do for me is make me want to go back and watch the far superior original
<START> i do not remember at least in the last ten years or so a movie that i have liked less than mama mia from the non existent acting to the atrocious singing i was cringing at least once per minute i don't believe i could even recall one brief segment that i tolerated i do know that i will never watch this disaster again i cannot believe that with such high expectations due to the talent colin firth meryl streep pierce brosnan that a movie could be such a flop but to see the lack of acting skills shown the seemingly drug induced dancing and then horrors of horrors to hear the singing of pierce brosnan i cannot see how this movie will not make it into the hall of shame definitely a movie that never should have been made and just in case you missed it the first time one that i will never watch again
<START> my main criticism is quite simply that it isn't long enough or detailed enough i would have loved to see more of everything the building of the vessel the engineering the training the first lift to orbit preparations for departure venus orbital injection everything i would have liked to see more of the first leg venus to earth instead of zipping there like a corporation bus in fact i would have liked to see a series on the scale of earth story made of this with a full hour dedicated to every planet and maybe another to the loop around the sun as it was i was left hungry on the other hand i do understand budgets and viewers' attention spans br br re the science let's be fair about the speed of light time lag they did mention at the beginning that there was a lag in conversations but they let this evaporate once they reached the outer planets some kind of conversation had to be presented to the viewers and we have to assume that the lag was edited out for the sake of so no complaints there but zero for noisy spaceships the only film in which spaceships make no noise was kubrick's 2001 and even then he copped out by using the noise of the crew breathing in their helmets which was pretty effective i wish the makers of space odyssey had realized just how eerie the sight of vast rocket motors blasting in absolute silence might be but alas pegasus lets out much the same roar as every other cardboard spaceship in every other cardboard scifi film br br but the rest of the science was excellent no complaints there in fact praise for bringing out the radiation problems as well as they did i just hope that having done this film won't discourage the bbc from making a really detailed version but i suppose that's not for next week or next year either
