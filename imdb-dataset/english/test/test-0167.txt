<START> in addition to all the negative reviews i was amazed to see that at the drop of a hat somewhere somehow a cctv camera was summoned at a most unlikely location to show the team what was going on notably near the thames barrier where the professor is hit at full wind force against the head by a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell the story otherwise i was unable to shake off the image of some actors as portrayed in other films programs i said to my wife 'hey that's neil from the young ones' nigel and 'did they summon hercule poirot for help ' david suchet to add to the disgrace of this film shown in two parts on itv uk recently itv showed the telephone number of the environment agency after each episode for worried viewers living in areas 'at risk of how low can you as a broadcaster go to treat your audience like that what must the environment agency have thought ''oh no it's mrs jones from hull again she says she was right all along she saw it on
<START> i have always been fascinated by silent films there is something about seeing actors and actresses from 100 years ago performing jaded by today's high tech special effects i always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of it's original release it helps to appreciate the crudeness of early cinema br br the life and passion of jesus christ is a very charming production from pathe originally filmed in 1902 but expanded and finally released in 1905 imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life separated by title cards and you will have a pretty good idea of what this film is like for example the scene in which mary and joseph rest as they are escaping to egypt is almost identical to luc olivier painting rest on the flight to egypt right down to mary sitting on the famous sphinx while some might find these living paintings an unimaginative cop out i found them to be very charming and very nostalgic br br the sets and costumes appear to be right out of a stage production of the life of christ possibly from and elaborate passion play of the day the make up on the cast is very theatrical so much so that a close up of jesus is almost comical again where others might be bothered by the of them i was quite charmed br br having been filmed over a period of 3 years the continuity isn't too bad the biggest flaws are in the casting changes made over that time the characters of john the apostle and the 12 year old jesus change in mid scene much to the audiences surprise br br the best unintentional humor of the film is in the birth of jesus scene the baby literally appears as if by magic in the manger between mary and joseph maybe it was simply my frame of mind at the time i viewed it but i laughed out loud if only child birth were that easy to top it off the actress who plays mary looks bored through the whole scene actually through the whole movie as if this sort of thing happens every day my how times have changed br br as simplistic as this film is compared to today it's really a wonderful window into the past i recommend it br br
<START> the dvd for this film is by alpha video a company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints in defense often that is the only print available but the specialize in public domain and cheap o films if you can find another print by a different company try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded still compared to most alpha dvds this one is excellent especially since the sound is pretty clear and alpha never seems to include closed even with films with horrid sound br br a man has been dating a lady for a very long time one night he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman soon afterwords he comes clean to his fiancÃ©e about this she forgives him and they marry br br very soon after the wedding he gets a frantic call from the other woman she needs to see him and has just tried to kill herself when they meet he learns that she has an std and she wanted him to know that he too might now have it then although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt she somehow finds a gun and kills herself the makes a huge mistake he does not tell his doctor and he doesn't tell his new wife some time passes and now she and the baby are infected at this point the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people actually these were just films of people with stds that they spliced into the film most of whom have syphilis br br in some ways the film is very progressive it addresses a serious issue and it's interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual urges but only with each other not bad advice at all on the other hand the film never exactly says what it's talking about they never use the terms std vd or the like nor does it even name the diseases often it is referring to syphilis but at other times it's talking about herpes or other stds the information just isn't very clear or specific a very common problem with such films from this era audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their friends explain it all to them br br speaking of such films in the 1930s 50s lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films decrying the dangers of drugs and sex though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of cheesecake for audiences who usually could not see such racy fare in hollywood films many of these are hysterically funny since they are so over done and the information so inaccurate the most famous examples are reefer madness and sex madness both by the same two bit production company and compared to how salacious and stupid those two films are this cheap film seems like it should be in the criterion collection br br interestingly there are weirdos out there i would definitely be included among them that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun this one however isn't that bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isn't as grotesque as some similar films while the message really should have been more explicit and useful for a 1933 film it's pretty good despite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene remember kids just say 'no' to suicide br br oh by the way the two years of treatment they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis back in 1933 nowadays it's a lot more as are the rest of the stds
<START> not me if it came down to it i could kick a dog's ass and that's why this movie doesn't work for me if it was me against the alien or jason or hell i dunno any other horror movie antagonist then there'd be no contest and i'd have my ass handed to me barring divine intervention a horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a creature person being entity whatever that is more powerful or resourceful or intelligent than they are and then people think 'well what if that happened to me' and they get scared and that's why this is a horrible idea for a story i can't imagine myself being terrorized by a dog so i'm not scared
<START> it takes a lot for a movie to reach the already numb particles of my brain which have not already been tapped out due to the and world of movies but this movie has made it onto my 'magic movies' list to become a 'magic movie' it must leave every string of my being quivering in that which i can only define as and this movie has tapped into the fibers of how my mind thinks and if not for the deeply personal bond my head and the head of whoever made this shares it would look like another 'dead rave scene' movie from back when the 90's exploded with its ecstasy craze this is not how the movie came off to me at all it's reached into me and pulled up something that i thought was dead for a very long time and pushed me as far as to give it a critique of my own i forgot how long it's been since i've seen something that left me feeling this good inside i strongly suggest seeing this movie
<START> accepted let's see the only reason why i had chosen to see that movie was the hot dog shown in commercials when sp said ask me about my weiner after that i had to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friends and wow amazing one of the best films of the year the entire movie i was laughing like crazy the plot in this story is that bartleby justin long doesn't get accepted into any of the schools he applied so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he did make it into college so he makes the finishing touches and he fools his parents until more students look at the website and see the acceptance is one click away and all these rejects come to this school they face many problems and they just cant seem to get anything right 10 10 loved it now watch it
<START> ghost story has an interesting feminist revenge tale premise a list veteran actors colorful flashbacks with nifty look a like youthful counterparts of the old men scary staccato music heralding the approaching horrors atmospheric new england winter weather and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role ghost story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the more lurid special effects and to presenting a more cogent screenplay we should not have to be wondering about why the two trailer acolytes are in the script the biggest detriment of the film is craig definitely separated at birth from bill maher who from perhaps editing or just bad acting is totally ineffective he seems to specialize in wide eyed wide mouthed reaction shots not a lot of personality here the revelation however is alice krige pale faced enigmatic terrifying underneath the placid exterior however her eva galli is creepy even before she meets her fate i mean a young woman who says things like i'd like to take a bite out of you or dance with me you little toad is already not in the land of the living ghost story would have been much better in a low key val lewton mode the overdone special effects completely undercut the chill factor
<START> just watched this film on tv and it was awesome br br had just planned on watching it whilst doing some work however i ended up watching the whole film with out doing work as it was so good br br actors my not be very well know but the story line makes up for it the fact that the actors make are less well known only makes it more believable that the events could occur i did not feel a biased towards one character as i have no judgement of the types of character as i have never seen any of the actors in a film before which made it even more enjoyable br br would recommend watching it
<START> keys to the vip is one of the most entertaining informative and hilarious shows that is on television right now the idea is original and well executed as it manages to preserve the reality aspect but still remain entertaining all of the judges have a razor wit they're not the nicest at all times but if you're looking for comfort go watch a chick flick say what you like about validity of the show but it is absolutely real i know people who have competed on the show and they have confirmed this br br if you want to laugh watch this show it is on of the best comedy shows ever made
<START> loving the andersen fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd though brilliant author i eagerly looked forward to see this made for tv film unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion first of all the story script is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while shamefully abusing andersen's fairy tales presumably in order to sell the crap to suckers like me secondly pretty boy actor really ever seen a picture of the real andersen brew manages to portray hans christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed character he indeed was though annoying and irritating like andersen brew is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so ever thirdly the love story between andersen and the fictional whom actually should be henriette the wife of collin why this man has lived such an interesting life it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie br br i could continue this to be a very long list but feel it safest to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead
<START> man with the screaming brain certainly isn't a perfect movie but i'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career slapstick sarcasm cheese action and happy endings campbell is as a writer uneven there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other better incarnations the scene in the restaurant where and william battle for control of william's body is straight out of evil dead ii there are however lots of little touches and non sequiturs that feel rather brilliant such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue what are you looking at the movie looks like a sci fi channel original probably because it was the acting is actually pretty good i particularly enjoyed tamara as she was ruthless and cunning yes but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored ted raimi handled the standard bumbling assistant role admirably enough and bruce is funny as the arrogant sardonic condescending american jerk now that he's writing his own films you'd think he'd give himself a role that he hasn't been typecast in already man with the screaming brain is a bizarre nonsensical b movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously
