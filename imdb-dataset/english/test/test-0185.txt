<START> during my trip in a youth leadership forum i was channel surfing until i found tommy boy on tbs since i have never seen this film before i wanted to check it out my roommate who have already seen this told me this movie is a classic after seeing the whole movie i came to the conclusion that he was right br br tommy boy is constantly funny from beginning to end thanks to the comedic duo of chris farley and david spade farley is a riot as the title character a spastic doofus who just sails through life as if it wasn't important his slacker esqe ways soon come to a halt when his father brian dennehy a wealthy break pads king dies of a heart attack on his wedding day this leads tommy with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend richard david spade to hit the road to sell enough break pads to save the company br br the main reason tommy boy works are the funny performances from the lead cast farley is the funniest person in this movie the second funniest person being spade and the third being rob lowe as the film's villain who has bad luck another funny guy is dan aykroyd as ray a well known auto parts br br another reason the movie works is the large amount of jokes chris farley has hilarious slapstick moments and david spade has funny snide comments and one liners the gags in the movie some which involves a deer and a airplane bathroom are laugh out loud funny thanks to director peter segal naked gun 33 1 3 writers bonnie terry turner br br 3rd rock from the sun that 70s show and the cast br br tommy boy is a really funny movie although for some unknown reason most film critics including roger ebert find it horrible and unfunny i wonder when their sense of humor died i recommend tommy boy for those who are great fans of comedy thank you very much roommate

<START> and a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter xmas atmosphere that burton creates for gotham city is way cool it's weird that warner decided to release this as a summer film it doesn't fit br br but what's even weirder when you consider the content of this film is that it was aimed at families an upper class family throws their mutant baby down the sewer a socio phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent a lonely secretary dresses up in leather as a feline and a freak runs for political office and s m and bondage are presented in a very perverted way but burton got away with it his visual style in this film is at it's best br br this and batman dead end are the only true live action incarnations of the comic book character true the animated series was the closest to the source material but compared with batman forever and the un one after that batman returns is the best of the four br br darker and more violent than the first movie the sense of gothic pathos reaches a new high i was quite keen on michael keaton as bruce wayne don't even get me started on george clooney he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter michelle pfieffer is great as catwoman much sexier and more cat like she wears that leather outfit better than halle berry and danny devito was so convincing as the penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch and christopher walken is brilliant as the spooky max if you think you recognise chip shrek it's none other than a very young leatherface br br danny elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round his powerful and engaging themes are way better than the dross that followed in the later 2 schumacher movies this movie is the batman phenomenon at its zenith forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this let's hope that christopher nolan and christian bale can bring some integrity back to the live action batman with their movie next year br br this dvd was one of the first ever dvds released by warner almost 7 years ago and as a result there are no features and the case is a snapper pick it up cheap like i did and hope for an se in the future
<START> originally harped as a sequel to the slumber party massacre series this film falls flat on it's face with a new title first off if you are going to include the word massacre in your film's title you better deliver this one certainly does not there is no gore no on screen murders and no chainsaw as the box art would lead you to believe instead we get a paper thin overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game only to be offed one by one again this film could have been ok if the gore quotient was upped a bit why directors especially those doing direct to video flicks are afraid to show any gore is beyond me now i am not a huge fan of excessive gore but come on why else would anyone rent a movie called cheerleader massacre besides that problem the film suffers from a shot on a home video camera cheapness it looks cheap sounds cheap and the actors aren't all that good it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be but even that fails the ending ends up being a ridiculous mess folks if you run across this film walk away and go find the original slumber party massacre 2 out of 10
<START> i really love this movie i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look and then i found it they put it out in spain on dvd under the name mas que amigos and you can buy there it is in english and spanish on the dvd hope this helps i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't released to the u s market best of luck oh for more info here is one place to look http www com i think it going for 10 dollars usd on ebay as well
<START> at first sight this is yet another highschool anime with lots of excuses for but there is a lot more going on the is part of the plot the main character is a tired cynic unusual and most importantly there is a clever plot that ties all the episodes together and that poses some interesting questions the episodes are deliberately non chronological and it is certainly worth watching the series again in chronological order br br the series is worth watching carefully because there are a lot of casual hints in there that foreshadow and explain things plus a good number of in jokes about other series anime and other
<START> this is one of my all time favourite movies if ur not into cars then forget it this movie features 1 of aussies greatest muscle cars the yeah so the acting not the greatest it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep you back for more and more there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70's and an awesome with a real cool cat it also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie big fast cars with of steel no plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting
<START> a beautiful film cleverly shot with an eye to war era detail and considering it is set during wwii minimal violence br br a small cast weaves an emotive journey through the occupation of czechoslovakia the separation from loved ones as the pilots depart for england the separation from the spaniel will touch hearts spitfire scenes love friendship and betrayal the theme of betrayal runs deep through the movie from betrayal of love to betrayal of friendship and finally the betrayal shown by the communist regime to former raf pilots post war br br a desperately sad film all the more so because it is so factually accurate i would recommend it to everyone
<START> unfortunately i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango since i am a sci fi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested me br br instead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of like minded individuals but very un christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions shame on you at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wild eyed craziness br br so this b grade movie and i am being kind production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups but if you are a mainline christian or non christian you will not be comfortable
<START> i first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network t v i think i was like 9 picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television anyway i've seen it again years later and it's like i remembered it's really good scary flick i think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a load of sequels i e friday the 13th but it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better even though this is a killer in the woods flick like friday it has more in common with the original texas chainsaw massacre that's because the movie lays down a certain atmosphere and feeling of dread even in broad daylight and the killers feel more threatening than in friday there's also a good amount of suspense i recommend seeing it now that it's being released on dvd in late july
<START> i have watched every version of this play that i can think of including several on the stage and sir derek jacobi is absolutely the best hamlet i have ever seen br br he has the most wonderful voice for stage acting and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play the way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness he as hamlet can in an instant be loving soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life you believe that he is in pain you believe that he is angry you believe that he is not a little mad you believe he is hamlet br br of course some of the thanks obviously goes to shakespeare but without an excellent actor to get the words from the page to the stage it doesn't really matter how well written a play is br br if you like shakespeare you absolutely must see this version if you don't like shakespeare you absolutely must see this version you will come away with a new appreciation for shakespeare if you do the nuanced performance that sir derek gives will leave you breathless
<START> spitfire 1934 john cromwell katharine hepburn ralph bellamy robert young br br mountain hillbilly katharine hepburn as trigger hicks is a religious back woods laundry woman going on 18 she begins to attract male attention and responds by throwing rocks the arrival of a dam building construction crew triggers dreams of romance in ms hepburn she quickly attracts the attention of suave engineer robert young as john stafford who hides his marital status supervising engineer ralph bellamy as george fleetwood is also interested in hepburn but for different reasons mr bellamy wants to know more about jesus christ whom hepburn worships br br after hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch br br if it weren't so serious spitfire might be more amusing it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star who is thoroughly unconvincing of the leads mr bellamy performs best however the best characterization is essayed by sarah haden as etta dawson who appeared in george cukor's stage version along with louis mason as bill grayson will geer as west fry grandpa walton in the 1970s has a small role an unexpected ending helps
<START> i saw beyond about 20 times it was that good at first when i watched it i saw the story of laura bowman but later after multiple showings i realised that this also was a parallel documentary it came to be in my mind a story about san and the struggles of women to remain strong in the face of uncertainty danger and sadness i also would put history and politics on the list after further viewing since i did learn a lot about past and present and could only guess at it's future this movie is not only one you will want to see it's also one you will definitely want to own a copy of it's a movie that could easily been seen by the whole family although not for children under thirteen however the educational benefits of this movie can not and should not be understated
<START> after a humiliating experience on an airplane wade kevin hart the airline and uses the money he wins to start up his own full service airline what makes his different is that it has sexy stewardesses an on board dance club and no less than captain snoop dogg in the cockpit br br soul plane is a very racist comedy except it is only occasionally funny soul plane has been described as an urban version of airplane the problem is that soul plane doesn't even come close to achieving the laughs of airplane the jokes in soul pane are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal i would be lying if i said i didn't laugh since there were some funny moments however i was expecting more and i left the theater disappointed br br i would compare soul plane to airplane 2 the latter was just a rehash of the first film while the former is just a rehash of outdated crude jokes there is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots however i don't think soul plane is bottom 100 bad right now the movie is ranked at number 82 and that's a little harsh i'm not saying this is a good movie but it isn't a terrible on either the running time is only 86 minutes long so it isn't too much of a pain to watch for stupid comedies you can do a lot worse br br no one in the cast is very good but they all seem to be having fun and this helps kevin hart was very annoying as he had a few funny lines but he is a very poor leading man snoop dogg who was mildly funny in starsky and hutch completely flunks here tom arnold was actually tolerable and that was the film's biggest surprise the most annoying person in the movie was ryan he was not funny at all and he will never be funny the funniest cast members were missi pyle and mo'nique they gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most in the end soul plane may fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy but it would probably be better if you just skip the film rating 4 10
<START> this movie was thought to be low budget but it turned out to be awesome i just rented it from blockbuster and i loved it the acting was very good hot women and some scary parts it is plain and simply worth the money to pay for
