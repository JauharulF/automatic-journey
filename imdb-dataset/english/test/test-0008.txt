<START> i'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one when i was watching this movie a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're supposed to sob or at least feel touched like when hunting said he didn't love the girl like when robin williams' character sorry i forgot his role's name was telling hunting repeatedly it's not your fault oh lord just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps i couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters many people sob for hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to think titanic yuck but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre i guess i simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this br br folks it's not me who's being condescending those characters are and for no good reason because they're unreal worse yet nothing is new or surprising even robin williams' character is all cliched br br i gave it 1 out of 10 it's probably not that bad it's just quite mediocre but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so i figured a single balancing vote won't hurt
<START> i actually enjoyed if not for much more than mocking the production values dennis hopper was just fine although i wonder if he would have signed on the project had he seen the special effects they used and furthermore what was with the scene with the ninja that was just completely out of pace perhaps someone came up with the bright idea mid shooting oh well this movie is great if you're drunk and need a good laugh cheers
<START> now infamous western that was at its time the biggest budgeted disaster in hollywood history i was lucky enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990 it was truly staggering how bad the film was br br they had a great cast a story based on a true incident a fight between foreigners and americans in the 1800s magnificent scenery so what went wrong three words director michael cimino he was so full of himself after the deer hunter he went out and made this god awful western he's not totally to blame his previous film the deer hunter was considered a masterpiece and united artists gave him free reign to do anything they let him all alone and everything went wrong the cost went barreling out of control and cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfect br br first off the sound is horrible entire sequences go by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying for instance jeff bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence but i still have no idea who he was the dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible that's the director's fault he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out what's going on the story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and cimino took great liberties with the facts in the real story only one person was killed cimino turns it into a massacre there is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre all the prints sound that way br br this garbage effectively closed down united artists and was the end of cimino's career a textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing jeff bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did this is from a guy who made tron a definite must miss br br there is a pretty good book called the final cut which details the whole disaster this gets a 1 i wish imdb had negative numbers this deserves it
<START> if you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war you need to see called the cranes are flying in english it tells the story of veronika tatiana and boris who are in love on the verge of wwii they are walking along the waterfront watching the cranes fly by when the war starts boris is promptly sent off to war veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son whom she does not love boris meanwhile continues trotting through the countryside fighting the nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war until he he runs out of energy when veronika working in a military hospital receives this news she refuses to accept it until boris' body arrives home on one of the trains simultaneously the radio announces that germany has surrendered and the allied powers have won the war the soviet union lost 27 million citizens but it's the start of a new era br br this movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield but also how it affected the civilian population this is definitely a movie that everyone should see

<START> ok so in any wile e coyote road runner cartoons we know that is going to set up all sorts of traps for rr but always himself in various ways that certainly happens in beep beep predictable i guess that it is but when you think about it these cartoons show how the more you try to harm someone else the more you get harmed sort of like how daffy duck always tries to undermine bugs bunny's integrity but bugs sees around it br br overall this is another classic from the termite terrace crowd sometimes i think that if we really had wanted to ease cold war tensions we could have just let the soviet union see looney tunes cartoons i'm sure that they would have loved them another great one br br ps i learned on jeopardy that wile e middle name is
<START> this was answer to fatal attraction and this is a classic film in its own right juhi chawla was good and so was sunny deol but it was shah rukh khan who shot to fame as the stalker since then he has become a favourite of the chopra's dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge dil to pagal hai veer zaara and de india shah rukh at first appears to be a villain but then towards the end you start to sympathize with him the scripting was superb and the songs were my favourites are too mere and teri br br after the dismal failure of the underrated yash chopra fought back with darr the dialogues were memorable the k k kiran dialogue is often repeated since darr yash chopra has slipped bit dil to pagal hai was bad but he redeemed himself slightly with veer zaara which was far far better this was yash chopra's last masterpiece
<START> i have to preface this by saying that i love watching bad movies that are entertaining this movie delivers 100 it is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen it is full of crappy stock footage of random stuff in a city people walking traffic the skyline etc that doesn't tie into anything then there are the overly long 'sex scenes ' these involve lots of petting and frequent rubbing of socks on each other's bodies these are in no way erotic and are the closest thing to horror you will find in this movie this is especially true for the shower scene where two of the so called girls who couldn't be a day over 40 are spraying each other with blood but there is also a crew member squirting blood in the from the outside while one of the girls keeps smiling at him no one had to memorize any lines for this movie if they aren't clearly reading cards then they have a magazine in front of them they keep glancing at while they struggle through awkward dialogue then there's mr he throws ed wood's name around like he can somehow compare but he is far far from anything of that quality he walks around a cemetery babbling about random things that went wrong in the movie which really helps the complete lack of flow the movie already had going on we couldn't stop laughing during this movie except during the sex scenes where we were grossed out and occasionally horrified br br i give this movie a 1 10 for going so far above and beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie
<START> the film's tagline is you think you know who you are you have no idea i reject both the suggested idea that i have no idea who i am and the inferred suggestion that this film tells me who people truly are if people in real life are really like this then man we're screwed br br a bilious film that i walked into late and left prematurely a film which is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming the race film of all time that it loses sight of the very tools a film must use br br the rules of hollywood are such if you show something in the first half it must be used in the second half thus the gun that the daughter worries about her father buying will somehow find its way into the story in the second half the rules of hollywood are to make dialog 'real' a concept which changes with every decade is this 'real somehow less ludicrous than the 'real of kevin smith ten years ago the rules of hollywood state that we set the scene and as action rises the camera moves in closer to the faces in this film primarily so we can see the supposed shame humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters the strings increase the frame rate slows down and our heart is meant to break br br this film is as crassly manipulative as it is vapid i have my own prejudices against l a which i freely admit so to combat this prejudice i will not say that this is a natural situation stemming from the location but rather probably from the author and director the writer paul haggis already showed a taste for polemics over humanity in his million dollar baby which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring out the best of a script's ideas now that paul haggis has his own hands on the camera it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write true natural human drama he does not know how to photograph or direct it as well paul haggis comes from the land of tv let us not forget the land of diminished expectations br br everything is as obvious as a tv movie simply presented for simple minds haggis drills into us over and over again that while on the surface people may seem to be awful they have secret pains hidden this is a nice idea but so presented that the whole juxtaposition of bad good has an amateurish feel structurally the film is broken up in the tradition of magnolia and other earlier films the editing is as typical and conventionally cinematic as could be if there is a dramatic movement such as a door opening or a car driving past between the subject and camera the editors use that extreme movement to give the cut that occurs there a more kinetic quality the problem is that other than the drive to keep things moving there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts everything is kept by the books not only are the puppets of this hideous racial punch and judy show ineptly handled but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence br br the film tries desperately to present reality but there's just no talent whatsoever some of the actors are good some of the actors are bad and all of the performance get muddied together brought down by the low low aesthetics of the film we have cinematography which is technically clear we can see the scene we have a clear understanding of what is happening however not only is the cinematography unremarkable but it is thoughtless camera work and framing which believes that it actually is inspired the result is little stylistic flourishes which one recognizes but do not actually add anything to the drama or pathos for example and this is a spoiler as a father holds his dying child the father might be shot too i didn't stick around to find out the camera sees his face and gives us the famous vertigo track zoom the vertigo shot it was at this point that the film became hysterical and i just had to leave i had to leave because it was so bad i left because i was in the middle of a crowded theater and i wanted to express to the audience that i was sick of hollywood 'art' which is full of sound and fury yet signifying nothing in the bard's own words i hate to waste such good shakespearian references on something this remarkably bad
<START> this film has absolutely no redeeming features it's not even worthy of being in the 'so bad it's good' category it's simply bad badly acted badly shot badly written badly directed terrible sound recording and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur quite how this got a release is beyond me br br oh and could someone please tell the lead actress that if you're playing that does not mean that you should constantly fiddle with your hair in a film that was generally irritating this was probably one of the most irritating things of all br br on the plus side i think this is the only film ever to feature a nazi
<START> i just saw this movie at the berlin film festival's children's program and it just killed me and pretty much everyone else in the audience and make no mistake about it this film belongs into the all time 250 let me tell you that i'm in no way associated with the creators of this film if that's what you come to believe reading this no but this actually is it nevermind the kid's film label on it climber girl is on almost every account a classic as in biblical the story concerns 12 year old ida magnetic julie who is devastated to learn of her daddy's terminal illness special surgery in the us would cost 1 5 million and of course nobody could afford that so ida and her friends jonas and sebastian do what every good kid would and burglarize a bank sounds corny don't forget this is not america and is by no means the tear jerking robin williams multiplex plat du jour nobody takes seriously anyway director fabian set out to make a big budget action comedy for kids and boy did he succeed let me put it this way this film rocks like no kid film and few others did before and there's a whole lot more to it than just the action after about 20 minutes of by the numbers exposition well granted it into a monster that br br effortlessly puts mission impossible to shame the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look real expensive take that mummy br br dwarves almost every other movie suspense wise no easy they're only kids antics here br br easily laces a dense story with enough laughs to make jim carrey look for career alternatives br br nods to both damon runyon and karate kid within the same seconds br br comes up with so much wicked humor that side of p c that i can hear the american ratings board wet their pants from over here br br manages to actually be tender and serious and sexy at the same time what am i saying they're kids they're kids nevermind watch that last scene br br stars pagels anderson who since last years is everybody's favourite kid actor br br what a ride
<START> i saw recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival and i can't believe that this is official submission to the 79th academy awards to be considered for best foreign film producer anna anthony last year also had official submission for best foreign film with i wasn't personally a fan of but at least it had some production value to it this could have been shot as a high school film project as a short film it may have worked but as a feature film it is as lost as it's characters this is a story about five twenty something friends who live in a small swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their long gone childhood actually isn't like some remote northern swedish village it's a popular summer resort with a population of city and townships of almost 40 000 and lies between two major southern coastal swedish cities of and the characters are likable enough guys but if they were high school age kids with a bleak or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives i would undoubtedly care about them more they are however long past the point where they should be making plans to deal with adulthood if they want to stay in forever than certainly there must be some jobs in the tourist or fishing industry instead of just riding bicycles drinking smoking pot and occasionally painting a house maybe if they hung around with a girl or two in their circle of friends of which girls are absent from this film altogether which doesn't make sense makes his directorial debut and co wrote the film along with the cinematographer of which i use the term loosely fredrik the acting isn't too bad i would give this a 4 5 out of 10 but despite it's submission for consideration for the academy awards i would not recommend it
<START> maximum risk is a step sideways for van damme and just more of the uninspired b movie action stuff we've come to expect from films featuring the macho belgian martial artist the flick has gaping plots holes goofs galore a messy plot and a gorgeous henstridge who spends most of her time looking like she's waiting for a cue maximum risk doesn't distinguish itself in any way and will likely not have much appeal beyond the usual young male audiences c
<START> this movie was a pleasant surprise because i didn't expect much i didn't know that some of the actors have since become bigger stars in major pix while moving on to the matrix is not a plus in my book hated it i'm sure it's a career plus for hugo james purefoy is great in this and jennifer ehle sweet and wonderful it seemed sometimes like a carnaby street romp 30 years later but i enjoyed the thrift shop janis joplin clothes mixed up with the modern mindsets of sexual and gender blur the real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his listings is loads of fun the iron john mens' group meetings are a bit dated but i still loved them it's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old carry on movies the british know how to do sex comedy and it's an old tradition unlike the united states which is too prudish to really understand that sex is funny
<START> the ascent is a very worthwhile addition to recent re releases from the soviet union director 1977 film examines the moral ramifications of allegiance and honor in german occupied russia during the second world war on foot and in a blizzard two members of a partisan soviet group leave to locate supplies and are captured by nazi soldiers the focus of the movie is on how each man handles or internalizes his moral alternatives one chooses dignity and integrity while the other opts for collaboration with the enemy however in the end he cannot abide by his selfish decision the film makes much use of slow wide angle pans which shift to extreme closeups and highlight the spiritual quandary within the souls of each man this is not a great film but it does effectively portray an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a harsh and frigid soviet wilderness
