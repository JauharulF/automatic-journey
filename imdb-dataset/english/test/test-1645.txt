<START> as a long time fan of studio ghibli and especially hayao miyazaki films i went to the film right on the opening day when i went out of the theater i had this strange feeling that something was missing this magical feeling i was experiencing in all miyazaki films before but i couldn't say why it failed this time after i thought about the other ghibli movies i may know the reason this film had most of the elements of a great miyazaki anime cute characters wonderful key animation a great soundtrack composed by joe hisaishi and the warm story telling giving you the feeling of watching a high quality japanese animation film however two elements were lacking a deep story and dramaturgy the purpose of this film was obviously to entertain small children with a simple story line as in case of totoro so a complicated story as been told in spirited away or princess mononoke is not really necessary but on the other hand this story was simply too superficial i could not connect to the main characters because there was no character development dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long i really hate to give only 7 stars for a miyazaki film because i would give 10 stars to all previous movies right away but this time it was simply not this wonderful ghibli experience
<START> i have never seen a movie that annoyed me that much it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things this is not a funny movie i must say that the plot line is awful i did not had patience to watch it so that i only saw half of it but it was enough for me the characters are not very inspired just terribly annoying this movie is all about a goofy guy trying to hook up with his tyrannous boss's daughter when he finally manages to talk to her she asks him to go at that night at her home to watch her father's owl and he thinks she had invited him to go with her at a party and to be at her home at 6 pm he gets to be very disappointed finding out that he only has to take care of the owl and that she has a boyfriend after her father leaves home leaving precise orders about taking care of the house and his beloved bird appears a secretary a son and all sort of not funny stuff happens in the house but he finally hooks up with his boss's daughter trust me this movie is terrible
<START> first off let me say i wasted halloween movie night by watching this garbage second let me inform you that the current dvd available by shriek show is not uncut so you gore hounds will be very upset third that one scene is the highlight of the film and since it's been cut well you see where i'm going br br i know a lot of horror fans dig this movie it is atmospheric shot in the woods with some very nice scenery waterfalls and such but after the opening kill which has a very brutal shot of a machete being jammed through a hunter's crotch you get no real brutal kills after that and with a slasher movie you sort of want that at least i do the director and co do nothing new with the killer in the woods idea several of this type of movie were all made right around the same time in the very early eighties the only thing this has going for it is that you don't hate the actors as much as you might in other films they are sort of likable the kids have a reason for being there one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain but what is not explained is why his family has property there there is no cabin or house so why buy property in east jesus especially if you aren't a hunter or whatnot well i'm sure some people do buy land for camping purposes but that just seems unusual anyway two squealing backwoods inbreds show up and start stalking the campers and picking them off one by one and as i said before you get pretty much nothing in the way of decent deaths after the machete kill in the beginning the ending has a sort of off the wall kill by connie but even that isn't enough to save this from being almost equal with the completely forgettable film the forest which is mind numbing br br if shriek show had been able to get a real uncut print then this review might have been a little more forgiving but this is the day and age of uncut unrated dvd releases of old obscure films for cine hounds like me when you slight us you get the crud review sadly the presence of the great fatherly george kennedy is the only highlight of this movie to set it apart from the other garden variety trash that was churned out back in the day
<START> wow fantastic film in my opinion i wasn't expecting it to be this good i was captivated from start to finish it's a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials darwin had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world chronicling his life as he writes origin of the species fighting both personal demons as well as the ignorant society of the time in order to do so he struggles hard with his mind body and soul as personal matters get to breaking point and even his family seems to slip away whilst the rest of the world stand against him as he knows that his findings literally shake the very foundations of their lives culture and meaning of existence it's a subtle movie not over exaggerated in any way in that typical hollywood way this is a bbc produced british film yet thankfully very powerful in meaning and this is thanks to the amazing well directed scenes as well as the superb acting by bettany connelly acts as more of a light supporting role but i did enjoy her in this and she's as good as to be expected as always her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and endearing you could feel the connection and their real life husband wife bond definitely shines through their performances but the star of the show is definitely bettany and he does a brilliant job a very touching performance i both understood and sympathised with him as he battled his own degrading health and impending insanity to try to understand what he has uncovered and come to terms with what it all really is and means as he found his thinking contradict his feelings and found himself losing it all including his wife who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict christian whilst he was in the realm of science two worlds which could not see eye to eye so their relationship was at stake too br br anyway a really very good well acted emotional drama and dare i say i did shed a tear during the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving the film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well in fact i can't wait to watch it again as there was a lot to take in first time round which i missed easily one of the best films i've seen this year
<START> there's nothing wrong with softcore but this one is pretty clinical lots of nudity but it's all fake of course it's always fake it's a movie but you know what i mean there's no sexuality or erotica it's all random nudity and poor acting of lust and sex with each other br br part of it is of course your personal preference these women clearly have some body issues with their piercings tattoos and silicon not to mention that overly plastique look so if that's your thing great you get to see all that here br br i don't think anyone's expectations are very high when looking at a movie title such as this but for many people it would be pretty much like looking at cyborg they almost seem real but it's really more creepy
<START> i am astonished at the major comments here for this ok surf film it really stems from the california dreamin school of barnyard to beach antics and isn't really plausible the idea that the lead kid learn to ride a board so well in a concrete wave pool that he beats the real surfers at their game in the real ocean is just plain silly in australia where most urban teens do surf this film was laughed at audiences took it all with a grain of sea salt made in the 80s but with its heart in the 60s it is fun to watch and looks and sounds good but it is not a in a classic class at all even the actors didn't this we're seriously in liquid bridge or ride the wild surf or beach blanket bingo land here oz stars like and big wednesday hero gerry lopez are drafted in to add head nodding recognition to our farm boy's wave prowess but it only made the crowd in the cinema guffaw it is for 10 years olds who do not question much it's not even in gods hands and that was silly too
<START> spoiler alert i worked as an extra on this lifetime tv movie filmed in seattle it's really interesting when you take part in the production of a movie because usually they are still in the process of either still writing parts as was the case here or making editing cuts and major changes from the final parts br br my husband and i both worked as extras in this movie and i recall them discussing on the set how it was yet to be determined whether or not the little girl dies in the end frankly i never thought margaret colin's character really got adequate punishment for her crime of hit and run lying to police covering up etc could you imagine how the ending would have had to change if she had ended up killing the hit and run victim instead of her ending up coming out of her coma okay just something to think about br br by the way i play a police detective you can see for a split second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often we've counted four times margaret colin was great to work with and very down to earth although lisa vidal now a lifetime regular was aloof br br overall the movie turned out to be about a 7 10 but like another poster commented is still a real tear jerker and makes a great saturday afternoon cable flick
<START> i really love anything done by savage steve holland the writer director of this great movie also see better off dead and how i got into college wonderful anyway this movie is really humorous and delivers some unexpected things where else but in this movie can you see demi moore as a talented singer and bobcat as a twin i recommend this to anybody looking for some old fashioned slapstick comedy george with the turtle raft not to mention some really well written sarcasm the christmas tree on the roof of the car this movie constantly throws you unexpected things even after you've seen it 100 times like i have enjoy
<START> this has to one of the most pathetic predictable and badly acted films i have ever seen clint eastwood has never been worse never have i seen somebody less convincing on screen i was laughing at him the whole way through then there's this romance kinda thing between him and the gorgeous rene russo which was even more pathetic than the one between mr connery and ms zeta jones in entrapment br br one imdb user posed the question what's not to like about this film i'm asking what is to like about it and the answer is john malkovich he is an absolute genius and probably the best movie villain ever he even saved con air you know but that's it br br this movie is called in the line of fire but 2 the rip off' seems to be a more appropriate title watch only if you are a die hard john malkovich fan otherwise avoid at all cost 1 2 out of five
<START> i absolutely loved this movie as a child i can't seem to find it anywhere i was mentioning it to some friends just the other day and not a single one of them remembers it can anyone help me out my older sister vaguely remembers it there was also another movie i remember that was half live action and half animation but i can't remember the name of it the characters were animated and the background was real i seem to remember it being about a kangaroo and i believe the setting of the film was in australia i'm going out of my mind trying to obtain copies of these films that were such a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood edit i searched imdb for this other movie and found out it's called dot and the kangaroo all i had to do was type in kangaroo in the search bar under characters and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell going off man i love imdb thanks
<START> one of the major successes to the decline of western civilization filmmaker penelope indie breakthrough is that it can perhaps appeal to non punk fans as to the hardcore ones more importantly it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely market worthy when bands would play or at the least try to play in some cases in dank dirty clubs to an audience that had as much self respect as they had respect for the bands for the fan such as myself there are precious interviews with some of the quasi legends of la's punk scum some dead some still living and still hard working in the scene br br performances and interviews include the likes of the circle jerks x black flag in the pre henry rollins days catholic discipline fear the alice bag band and most memorable in my opinion being the germs while i knew of a few of the bands and performers in the film the jerks and black flag mostly i had only heard rumors about lead singer the late darby crash and from the footage in the film he seems to be one of the if not the of the punk movement he doesn't take himself too seriously he loves to drink sometimes when he speaks it's complete gibberish and the attitude he brings on stage is both funny and in a free form way exhilarating a performer like that would probably scare steve miller and jackson browne out of their skins br br decline of western civilization may not turn on every non punk fan that seeks this film out it's hard to find on video but it shouldn't necessarily turn them off either like a kind of anthropologist that's sneaked into the party gets the behavior of these people down pat their motives their likes and hatreds and the power that was their on and off screen personas a few of them almost come off as normal some don't but they're only offensive to those who aren't too open to things on top of that the film is a must see to the kinds of kids that think they're punk fans just because they listen to good charlotte and blink if you want to get the real scoop on the movement and genre of rock you profess to love give the pioneers a chance a
<START> i wish depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success at least he'd have wound up with something br br the film struck me as pointless rambling and very stylish like some other recent french films not to knock it most recent american films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever we should be grateful i suppose for photography that evokes a european city in the midst of a wind blown continental winter and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's up br br but there can be too much of a good thing golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such there are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood you'll love it if you're vlad the impaler lots of people die catherine deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle i don't know why young girl dies too and i don't know why she dies either she gets slapped in the face falls to the pavement and dies br br there is supposedly an explicit sex scene too i'll have to take their word for it because although it is stylishly photographed it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness don't worry about the kiddies being shocked they'll probably be asleep by this time anyway br br depardieu isn't a bad actor as we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man well handsome except that his nose can't seem to get out of his way to a limping murderous hairy physical wreck we feel sorry for the guy golubeva has a wan pretty face with enormous half eyes and wide cheeks like a doll her next movie should be a remake of lewton's i walked with a zombie then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band i guess it's a band as far as i could make out the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but listeners fond of easy listening might not enjoy it if you don't like the music there's a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with depardieu's walking stick br br i must say i found it barely worth sitting through and it's a too at times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by sometimes stopping entirely i wish it had had a few jokes
<START> you want to know what the writers of this movie consider funny a robot child sees his robot parents killed beheaded as i recall and then moves between their bodies calling their names yeah what a comic moment this is the worst movie i ever paid to see
<START> i was at the premier of the movie last night in rome i am not an expert in the book however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie the pacing of this movie is much faster than the davinci code many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace i think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for hanks brown and company br br there are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form i am not giving any spoilers except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way how leonardo was found is also different those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story some minor details are are also cut from the movie br br although they did film in rome they had to recreate interior shots since i went on a walking tour of rome the day before the movie i can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the vatican archives of course they had no access to that area and i am not sure if anyone actually knows what the vatican archives look like has her break in this movie as victoria and does a good job as eye candy for hanks br br this movie should be received better by the critics and public but you never know ron howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie that this is just a movie
<START> yes i had the misfortune of watching this film when i was younger at a friends house as his mother was a teacher and she wanted to screen the movie and see if there were any inappropriate scenes that a parent might object to well other than the unfunny jokes i think this one was in the clear well the unfunny jokes and the strange scene where the look a like ernest hits on a girl so yes ernest gets thrown in jail thanks to a look a like and proceeds to try to escape and there is other stuff to it like him becoming at one point shooting electricity and in a very painful to watch finale flying there are a couple of jokes but nothing to much to mention except for the gun carved from soap i think that is the only scene me or my friend's mother laughed out loud at this and camp are the only two ernest movies i have ever seen and from what i have seen in them i am not going to track down the other films ernest was good in small doses but a movie is just to much even when it is as short as this one i figure though the films made money mainly because all you need is varney and a location and a theme and you have your movie
