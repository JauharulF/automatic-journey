<START> i would just like to say that the cure was a movie to help inform how people who are hiv positive have to function in life a young boy who cant go to school because he could contaminate someone and the ignorance of the boys who called them that just shows how much children are not educated about aids
<START> i agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie i read the book as a sophomore in high school in sc i instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the mini series as much as i liked the movie and thought it was very well done i was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book i was glad the orry was not killed off like he was in love and war or n s ii br br having grown up in sc and graduating from university of sc i fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book i had the honor of meeting john jakes at a symposium in 1988 at usc i stayed around afterwards and meet mr jakes unfortunately i did not get to ask him a question but meeting him was honor enough i majored in accounting but got my minor in southern studies in addition i patterned a lot of my mannerisms after orry main orry and myself are very much alike i feel i was born 150 years too late i am a southern gentleman and very proud of this br br well i fell in love with 2 women in the movie genie francis and wendy man did i have the hots for wendy i never quite could find a real life version of her i hope one day too
<START> i consider myself a casual fan of dario argento for every really good flick by him such as deep red and tenebre there seems to be one that's equally uninspired his output since opera has tended to disappoint still there's no denying that when he's at his best there are few horror directors who can top him i consider opera to be argento's finest work br br this is definitely the film where all of his trademarks are present there's no well developed characters and the plot makes very little sense once you begin to scrutinize it still think of argento as an european equivalent of brian depalma the style is all that matters here so much it becomes the substance typical to argento there's some beautifully filmed murder sequences those unfamiliar with the man's work may perceive that as a sadistic remark and it may be considering the often time misogyny of them but its really true argento stages murder with an intricacy to eye popping visual detail he truly makes graphic violence an art form plus his direction and the look of his films is impeccable br br fortunately opera is one of his most frightening products argento is the only director whom i feel booming rock music works well for horror sequences when others attempt to pull it off it comes across as cheesy the acting varies with cristina playing a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic but never particularly animate young opera performer the rest of the actors are workmanlike and get the job done but again with argento the acting is never the point its the beautiful colors the terrifying violence and the overall fever dream nightmare atmosphere 9 10
<START> in my opinion the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing the initial idea of having someone suddenly realize they were the son of god and the second coming was somewhat clever people started to believe him and his friends became the new disciples people went nutty demons were possessing people all kinds of fun of course then it all went wrong it was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a vast amount of writings to find the third testament in five days but then at the end it became this ridiculous humanist fantasy i won't spoil it but i'll just say it comes off as if it were written by a teenager with a very limited knowledge of theology i hear they are making an american feature version of this story i just hope they change the eye rolling ending
<START> i had never read much about or even seen stills of the six man british comedy group the crazy gang but my positive experiences with their contemporaries will hay and arthur askey â and especially graham high praise of the frozen limits itself âthe funniest english picture yet can bear comparison with safety last and the â made me take the plunge with the bare bones r2 dvds from network of this and their subsequent film 1941 see below both of which were released earlier this year with virtually no fanfare br br a british made western is a rarity but a british western spoof is rarer still carry on cowboy 1965 was still some 25 years away incidentally going back to the silent classics mentioned by greene the film seems to me to be more obviously indebted to the gold rush 1925 and way out west 1937 besides it also plays like a variation on the white and the seven fairy tale which had just been immortalized on the screen via walt animated masterwork and where the seventh member is played by ancient comic and frequent will hay foil moore marriott the gang actually call pretty heroine eileen bell by that name throughout and thereâs even an amusing sequence with the six of them preparing to go to bed and whistling the song from the disney film br br six comedians three sets of comedy duos allen knox and naughton gold may be the largest such grouping on film â though not all of their personalities emerge here my favorites were big bud looking a bit like jim backus straight man allen and squeaky voiced teddy knox however bald charlie naughton often took the limelight â since heâs the one on which the others always seemed to pick on still itâs marriott who steals the film from his very first scene â where he contrives to impersonate every official in the dilapidated theater of a ghost town a very young bernard lee is also notable as the villain of the piece br br the ore routine between and allen actually anticipates abbott and famous on first the film in fact hinges on a lot of wordplay for its humor â which doesnât necessarily travel especially at this juncture nevertheless there are several hilarious sequences throughout â a few of which even brought tears to my eyes the opening scene where the gang are defrocked by a band of angry creditors their dressing up as indians once they hit the yukon the ruse to make everybody rich with the same piece of gold they all impersonate the sleepwalking marriott to confuse the villains a gag which may owe its origin to the marx bros â hilarious mirror sequence in duck soup 1933 the spot on theater sketch which pokes fun at hoary melodramas the surreal moment when pursued by the villains one of the gang climbs a staircase that is part of the painted scenery in the theater and especially towards the end when a group of singing mounted police gallop ever so slowly to the rescue despite being egged on by the increasingly impatient ranger hero br br the soundtrack and the frantic nature of the gags themselves made it hard for me to get all the jokes sometimes â subtitles would certainly have been welcome in this case the crazy gang only made five films â with the first two also being well regarded okay for sound 1937 and button afloat 1938 and a much later reunion though allen had by this time bowed out due to ill health and been replaced by eddie gray called life is a circus 1960 directed by val guest who incidentally co wrote both gang films i purchased as well as some of the afore mentioned hay and askey vehicles
<START> regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film that vigilante justice is acceptable is justifiable i was more insulted by mcconaughey's closing statement in a courtroom drama the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury this basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl i for one find this very insulting as for the rest i found the acting reasonable with the exception of sandra bullock who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self doesn't really work in a courtroom drama but what's the point when the film's message is as poor as this one it tells you that vigilante justice is fine and accuses you of racism if you disagree
<START> i will keep it to bullet points so here goes 1 very badly scripted 2 tries to be like resident evil 3 zombies slow and docile one minute the next minute raging lunatics 4 never saw blood clean up so easily 5 special effects not as good as the original day of the living dead 6 acting not as good as the bold and the beautiful 7 it looks like it was written in 1 week and made the next week br br basicaly med team plus special forces go into a zombie infested university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague all die except the 2 main stars so predictable even though unarmed and swarmed with 100s of zombies they survived however special forces who were trained at kindergarten school scouts only took 1 zombie to kill them even though they had weapons also the obligatory jerk on hand to fill any gaps overall load of rubbish
<START> loved this movie what a hoot rupert and julie are great together with rupert being almost poker faced against julie's animation which worked well laura did a good job as the overbearing mother julie of course is marvellous as usual while this movie will keep you laughing most of the time it also has a poignant side to it as it unravels the secrets in the lives of the main characters interesting that it was entitled driving lessons as this might lead you to believe this is the main feature of the movie which directly it is not though it certainly could be seen as ben finally being in the driving seat in his own life like most things that are funny in life there is always the sad side and there are some moving moments in this movie very enjoyable movie and well worth watching
<START> price of honor aka price of power is an ambitious western melodrama light on the action which seeks to tell an old west version of the jfk assassination in 1881 the president travels to dallas and is shot from a window while parading thru town in his carriage corrupt officials have carried out the murder and have a humble slave take the rap our hero the earnest but bland giuliano gemma aims to unravel the conspiracy an engaging story audacious for its subject matter but entertaining despite the paucity of shoot em up action the film is a 7 out of 10 despite the poor presentation of the dvd which is overly dark with poor sound look for a good copy
<START> the acting was horrible the special effects while exceptional dominated the movie the writing was pathetic and the dialogue was unbelievable and the silly little love story between liv tyler and ben affleck was out of place br br but the worst offense of armageddon was the total lack of scientific reality the asteroid is the size of texas says billy bob thornton er that's 800 miles wide no one in nasa even sees the asteroid until a midday meteor shower wrecks havoc in new york nasa hires a drilling team to join the astronauts and trains them in a week yeah right someone brings a sidearm on the space shuttle with them yeah that's realistic and bruce willis blows up the asteroid with three seconds to spare how disney esque br br how bad was this movie i rooted for the asteroid
<START> i'm a big fan of the demonic puppets looking at the surface of this one it looks pretty good you've got the puppets and a new villain in the totem unfortunately the little punk that's doing this project to animate inanimate objects can't act he stinks his girlfriend is worse if they were left out it would probably be cool blade vs the totem i'd watch that for 2 hours but instead the puppets role is down played and the whole movie suffered because of it the mystical skull guy who created the totem is corny at best and appearance is long awaited short and really quite disappointing you'd be better off watching the first one again
<START> last time i checked the nazis didn't win the second world war not that you'd sodding notice after all the third reich was pretty big on issuing orders and demanding cold robotic obedience from the populace and that's pretty much what we're saddled with today but the way the orders are delivered has changed instead of being at in a german accent through a loudhailer they're disguised as concerned expert advice and floated under your nose every time you switch on the tv or flip open a newspaper there's a continual background hum a middle class message of self improvement whispered on the wind br br you eat too much you eat the wrong things you drink you smoke you don't get enough exercise you probably can't even beep properly you'll die if you don't change your ways your health will suffer have you got no self respect look at you you sicken me i pity you i hate you we all hate you god hates you don't you get it it's so sad what you're doing to yourself it's just so bloody sad that's the mantra and it goes without saying that the people reciting it are routinely depicted as saints last year the media dropped to its knees to give jamie oliver a collective blow job over his school dinners series in which he campaigned to get healthier food put on school menus given the back slapping reaction you'd be forgiven for thinking he'd personally rescued 5 000 children from the jaws of a slavering paedophile br br anyway the series was a huge success in fact in telly terms there was only one real drawback it wasn't after all when you've saved every child in the nation from certain death once you can't really do it a second time the only solution is to find a new threat which brings us to ian wright's unfit kids wed 9pm c4 a weekly programme in which the former footballer and renowned enemy of grammar forces a bunch of overweight youngsters to take part in some extra curricular pe br br it's essentially a carbon copy of the jamie oliver show with more sweating and fewer shots of pupils mashing fresh basil with a an uplifting fable in which shapes his gang of misfits into a lean mean machine combating apathy and lethargy confronting lazy parents and attempting to turn the whole thing into a nationwide issue that'll have range rover mums everywhere dampening their knickers with sheer in between trips to the conran shop oh isn't it simply terrible what these blob some plebes do to themselves not our josh you understand he eats nothing but organic spinach and attends lacrosse practise six hundred times a week br br bet he does the little yes it is heartwarming to watch flabby inconvenient kids transforming themselves with a bit of simple activity but there's something about the underlying eat your greens message that really sticks in my in case you hadn't guessed br br what happened to the concept of choice you beep so a bit of jogging might increase your life expectancy so what that just equates to a few more years in the nursing home whoopee do and besides i'd rather drop dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a bunch of smug toss ends trying to out health one another br br in episode two video games and the internet are singled out as villains in the war on they make kids too you see oddly enough tv which is equally and unlike those two activities actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy along with your physique escapes without a rollicking funny that br br well listen here channel 4 instead of forcing kids to eat bracken or do squat thrusts how about teaching them to think more so they reject the sly cajoling nature of programmes like this or would that be a campaign too far
<START> this is one of the strangest things on tv it is set in a bizarrely underpopulated midlands superb called which seems to be the dullest place in the country it features a bar with no visible staff or customers a university with no students a police station with no criminals and a surgery with more doctors than patients the story lines are dire every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem pretty entertaining for its pure comedy value but i cannot believe that this thing actually masquerades as a serious drama bonkers
<START> sexy murderess tiffany jennifer tilly still yearns for a life of wedded bliss with ex boyfriend crazed killer charles lee ray after getting her hands on the mutilated good guy doll that last played host to his spirit and doing a spot of repair work she conducts a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy br br unfortunately for poor tiff the reanimated maniac shows no interest in marriage and so she traps him in a cage with a bride doll for company eventually a rather angry chucky voiced by brad dourif escapes his confines electrocutes tiffany in the bath and traps her soul in his as retribution br br realising that they are now both in the same predicament the plastic pair put their differences aside and decide to head for hackensack new jersey where they can lay their hands on the magical amulet that can relocate their spirits into human hosts tricking trailer park hunk jesse nick and his tasty girlfriend jade katherine heigl into taking them to their destination the psycho dolls embark on a murderous rampage with their unwitting companions copping the blame br br although the idea of a kid's doll being possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer has always been rather comical it wasn't until the fourth film in the child's play series that the makers fully embraced the sheer lunacy of the premise opting to plays things much more for laughs than for scares although there is still plenty of ott splatter for us gore hounds to enjoy br br talented hong kong director ronny yu oversees proceedings deftly translating the witty tongue in cheek script into a slick and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic ride similarly the excellent cast handle the camp material perfectly with and heigl making a likable couple but smoking hot tilly stealing the show as blonde buxom pouting pvc mini temptress tiffany kevin impressively expressive doll effects also go a long way to making the film such a success br br overall this film is unlikely to find many fans amongst horror aficionados but those who enjoy the odd spot of mindless popcorn entertainment full of twisted black humour crazy death scenes and magnificent should have a blast
<START> i bought this movie at a garage sale when i was like 15 i hated it then and watching it again just for the hell of it it's even worse now you can hear the director and cameraman in the background yelling commands like zoom zoom zoom the are no special effects just a raw piece of meat that is supposed to be a brain this is utter crap and i originally thought it was a one of a kind home movie or something that i bought but this was distributed elsewhere and it's just really weird to know that other people have seen it whoops i need 10 lines well this can be an interesting thing to watch to see how no budget movies were made before the invention of digital cameras this sucks actually yeah do watch this just to see if you can sit through the worst if you can make it through this you can make it through anything
