<START> it hurt to watch this movie it really did i wanted to like it even going in shot obviously for very little cash i looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration unfortunately although i did appreciate the film on that level the acting and editing was terrible and the last 25 30 minutes were severe thumb twiddling territory a 95 minute film should not drag the ratings for this one are good so far but i fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one what was with those transitions dear mr editor did you just purchase your first copy of adobe premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program anyway some better actors a little more passion and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie
<START> this was a very faithful presentation of lewis's life in the mid 50's the dialogue on theology and the banter with his follow colleagues was exceptionally good michael white's book c s lewis creator of narnia deals with this time frame in a very parallel way joss ackland's acting was superb in catching the unemotional lewis the movie took great pains to be presented in an accurate english setting the development of a strong bond between jack his preferred name lewis and douglas son from her previous marriage was enjoyable to watch the movie did avoid the distasteful element of lewis's jack's older brother drinking problem but it would not have moved the story on so it is best left out
<START> i was half dozing as i watched a late night selection of short films but sat bolt upright from the first frames of i shout love and could not take my eyes away for its full brief perfect length with incredibly assured pacing and performances this film maintains its funny sad insightful tone throughout the credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type i had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work what a pleasing surprise to see the name of sarah a major actress who is too seldom seen br br kristen thomsen tessa and matthew ferguson bobby turn in rich touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up as they work through a reprise of favorite moments from their time together both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents and to the director writer's skills the film creates a moving narrative with laugh out loud moments and caught breath sorrow br br i shout love is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films i ever expect to see it has wit heart and stunning originality it matters
<START> i will give it a second chance but was very disappointed in the first one it wouldn't hold a candle to the other series it has a lot of meaningless dialog that doesn't add to the storyline at all i agree with the others that it doesn't seem to develop a story that is interesting it is slow and plodding and i only know what the are planning to do maybe it will all tie together in the second installment but i am going to have to force myself to watch it and find out i am of apache heritage from the texas new mexico area but i don't recognize much of what is happening maybe i am just ignorant of the facts but this isn't doing much to educate me
<START> a very very very slow moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out br br attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non existent very little music or anything to speak of the best scene in the movie was when is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head he goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales clerks before they find the album cute scene gave promise but it went downhill from there the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty wasted two hours
<START> gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama but i feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years immensely sympathetic performance from jared who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma hopefully without poor richards penchant for and and charming offbeat cuteness from costar yu xia combine to make this a real radiant location photography including beautiful scenes at the great wall and sensitive direction by ann hu give film added impact in short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life and making magic in the dark
<START> while hayao miyazaki's movies have always been hit or miss with me with regards to story they are unequivocally gorgeous to the eye with characters of simple animation against a backdrop of artistic images sticks to that formula with a lead character so adorable i want a plush doll of her and scenery so pretty it wouldn't look out of place framed up as a picture on a wall br br the story on the other hand i didn't enjoy quite as much as his last two wide releases spirited away and howl's moving castle it was just a tad too juvenile coming across as more for kids and leaving adults to just enjoy the animation br br i was also disappointed that the score done by joe hisaishi who also the scores for the above mentioned two movies wasn't nearly as memorable this time around while i can't quite recall howl's score now i still remember it being one of the most beautiful i had ever heard ditto though i only remember it being very complementary to the movie maybe it's because is more juvenile fare that the score isn't quite as haunting in any case this movie is still a must watch for fans of anime or miyazaki
<START> i saw the world premiere at the toronto international film fest this is a great film br br real life husband and wife paul bettany and jennifer connelly star as charles and emma darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to publish origin of species their consideration of the ramifications it may have for their family and the future of humankind are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off screen couple could achieve br br jon who gave a heart felt introduction and john do and excellent job of bringing biography to life they created some very poignant and human moments great cinematography and sets and a generous helping of tongue in cheek about the still divisive theory of evolution br br the surprise star is martha west who plays annie darwin the character around whom much of the story unfurls she plays the precocious young girl to a tee if this performance is anything to go by her star should be on the rise br br all in all a great film and although it is a period drama the issues that drive it are still very much alive today
<START> without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen in my life there was nothing entertaining about this film i know it was supposed to be a comedy but it actually made me cry at the thought of losing the 4 75 admission price
<START> just watched it on the hallmark channel i was surprised to john denver this movie was full of clichÃ©s but that is to be expected a made for tv christmas movie come on the acting is as good as any other '80's made for tv movie the story is as i said before predictable and clichÃ© but still good if you are looking for a campy christmas movie it will certainly scratch your itch br br i was also pleased when i learned that it took place in georgetown colorado it is a real mountain town west of denver very cool as this is my home region br br i was never a big john denver fan i always found him to be pretty but he was a decent actor he is very good as the good old boy like he played in this film br br if you get the chance to watch it than do i'm sure it will be on again in 2007
<START> it could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie you don't have to throw of money at a movie to make it good nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching but i think that is totally missing the point if your expecting fast cars t a or a movie that will spell itself out for you then don't watch this you'll be disappointed and dumbfounded br br this movie was thoroughly enjoyable kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think the writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end just remember to keep an open mind br br note the school scenes were all filmed at mcmaster university and most of the rest was done in toronto
<START> elfriede jelinek not quite a household name yet is a winner of the nobel prize for literature her novel spawned a film that won second prize at cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads am i a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes br br 'gobble gobble' is the favoured orthographic representation in britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey in the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception 'gobble gobble' and the piano teacher are perfect partners br br the embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated it begins very badly as if made to annoy the viewer credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes we are introduced to professor erika kohut apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress a stony professor of piano she lives with her husky and domineering mum dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action br br reviewing the piano teacher is difficult beyond registering its unpleasantness what we see in the film and might read in the book for all i know is a tawdry exploitative nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on br br erika whose name is minimally used is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed not quite because there's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies if a reviewer has to yawn extract a leitmotif why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do elrika's violently alternating moods would be it br br a young hunk walter studying to become a 'low voltage' engineer whatever that is and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments is also a talented pianist he encounters elrika at an old fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be paris in the glib fashion of so much art he immediately falls in love and starts to 'cherchez la femme' br br repressed erika has a liking for hardcore pornography shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches br br walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by erika whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness hostility discouragement and humiliation br br he soon declares his love and before long pursues erika into the ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex erika retains control over her lovesick swain she promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges br br in the meantime chillingly jealous because of walter's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert erika fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano playing hands br br the next big scene by passing the genital self mutilation etc has walter turning up at the apartment erika shares with her mother erika want to be humiliated bound slapped etc sensible walter is for the moment repulsed and marches off into the night br br at this point there's still nearly an hour to go the viewer can only fear the worst erika tracks down walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice they retire to a back room lusty wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers his 'baby gravy' is soon expelled with other stomach contents ho hum br br repulsed but hooked perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor walter returns to erika's apartment can you guess what happens now it's not very deep or difficult yes he becomes a brute while erika becomes a victim one moment he's locking maman in her room and slapping erika the next he's kicking her in the face having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love br br am i being unfair in this summary watch the film if you want but i'd advise you not to br br anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood i could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted but i 'prefer not to' because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing br br i'm supposed to say that parentally repressed erika longs for love ineffectively seeks it in pornography inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears pink and throbbing under her nose belatedly realises that she doesn't like being hurt blah blah blah br br the world has for reasons not explained stunted her she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise br br at the end if you have the patience to be there there's a small twist before going to the final scene where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear soiling student with the lacerated hands erika packs a knife in her handbag for walter br br yes you're ahead of me she stabs herself in a none life threatening area and leaves roll credits br br if this earned the second prize at cannes just how bad were the rest of the entries
<START> its hard to decide where to begin i bought this for a few quid and its the worst few quid iv ever wasted the back of the dvd had no pictures and a few lines plot summary this should have warned me but i usually like bad movies for a laugh so decided to give it a go the movie is made up of three short stories each revolving around someone who was on a particular bus at one point its never made clear what the significance of the bus is or what city its set in br br possible spoilers as if there is anything to be spoiled the first story is about a man who is persuaded by a car to it against his wife's wishes the car is sort of like a demonic and takes over his life br br the second is about a slob of a man who never cleans his fridge and a monster bacteria man grows out of it br br the third about a woman who goes to a dating agency only to discover her date isnt all that normal br br inbetween these we are treated to shots of the bus or a bus anyway while a narrator on a load of garbage about relationships really its like he is on commission for saying br br the movie actually has no redeeming features whatsoever the acting the costumes and the little are all disgusting there arent even any attractive female cast members to admire simply put this movie is a debacle
<START> viva la bam was one of those shows that i didn't have high if any expectations for before seeing it and i never even knew about it until i saw my friend watching it i had thought jackass was pretty funny but the stunts were just that funny and i never really got into the show when i watched viva la bam for the first time it was the complete opposite effect i loved it it had more of a tv show feel to it which a lot of the reality shows have today i was hooked and i wanted to see what new scheme they were going to cook up for each episode all the way to the last episode it held my interest and even though some of the ideas seemed rehashed at times it always had a newer and funnier twist to it viva la bam is one of those shows that get you hooked and i have yet to see another show that is quite like it
<START> de un combines the worst defects of mexican cinema a rare feat nowadays br br it's pretentious it wants us to believe that it is deep only because some scene is out of focus another is pseudo surreal yet another plays with the eisenstein tradition of laughing crying faces the edition is fragmented and it is all so solemn br br it has a weak script the main story hardly develops so it has other three smaller needless stories stuck into it they are only good to make the film last longer br br most of the acting is bad a true feat baring in mind that many of the best known mexican actors were cast br br there is an abuse of foul language to the point that the character of who symbolizes the dreams of freedom of a child uses it throughly br br it is homophobic the character played by eduardo is the sorriest and most punished representation of a transexual i have ever seen br br it is very boring i ended up envying the people that left the theater before the end of the film br br whatever it tries it has been done better in mexico and elsewhere br br in other words para la madre nada como una mala
