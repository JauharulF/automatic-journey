<START> i heard this movie was even warned me it was terrible but for some reason probably katie holmes i still watched it when it came on national tv watching kevin williamson films means torturing his scenarios aren't funny definitely not scary and not the least bit creative teaching mrs tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere as his brainless series dawson's and it's probably meant for the same target group as well before the credits even started 5 people already wanted a hug and they stated that eerie i love you' sentence it doesn't get any better as the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop rock and the storyline is ultra thin three students on the verge of graduation get caught cheating by the teacher in school every high school has a teacher like that you knowÂ to save their skin they try to convince mrs tingle that it wasn't their intention to cheat but this attempt goes horrible wrong the typical high school humor is completely lost on me the overdose of sentiment is pathetic and the acting with the exception of helen mirren is abominable i'm sure katie holmes can act Â that's a fact proven by her role in the Â but she urgently needs to stop accepting frumpish girl roles as said before the only positive comments goes out to the brilliant casting of helen mirren as the shrew it's like kathleen turner in serial mom' the role suits her perfectly and you can't imagine anyone else playing her other than that this is avoidable teenage nonsense
<START> hello looking for a movie for the family to watch on a friday night can't find what your looking for i thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie good for the whole family i found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike it was brilliant to say the least bruce acting was top notch there was a lot of humor in it and overall a great movie in my opinion it's a must see movie and i don't think that about a lot of movies believe me when i say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that it's clear that there was much work done by bruce willis and cast to get this movie done excellent story good acting and again overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie
<START> snakes on a plane was such a well hyped film that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year let alone the same week reading the other comments here i see the results a lot of people are mad mad because it doesn't have the best special effects mad because it doesn't have a star cast mad because they wanted to see samuel jackson say i'm sick of these m er f ing snakes on this m er f ing train br br well this sure ain't the samuel jackson version and maybe that's good br br snakes on a plane was lost between cop film and horror a family action film and a bloody gory movie of death saturday night live performers got laughs while jackson swore enough to make a grandmother cover her ears and as far as kids go they would be traumatized by the violence br br snakes on a train however knew exactly what it was this was a cheaply made horror movie on a train sure it had snakes and sure many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with fake rattler sound effects but never once did it miss a step in its plot or intention where as the on a plane version was tripping all over itself from the first scene on br br i did enjoy the over the top fun that snakes on a plane had to offer and i admit that the on a train version was a little dry but hey in trade it was a cool and unexpected story this little horror film could have gone way more wrong than it did br br for this it gets a 7 out of 10
<START> in my personal opinion i think this is the greatest video game ever created i first played this game at my friends house years ago the very next day i went out and got my own since that day close to seven years ago i have not stopped playing it i can't help it i just can't get bored of it i've been addicted to other games on other much newer systems but i keep coming back for more goldeneye every mission is amazingly fun and challenging the multi player mode was like none other i hope you can be as fortunate as i was to have played four player multi player mode because i had brothers and friends who would get together and play this game all the time
<START> begotten is certainly an experience and a out of the ordinary experience at that the use of colour is fascinating and at times frustrating a lot of what happens on screen is incredibly difficult to make out your view is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in colour and tone characters in the way and random cuts to the sky the sound is very haunting and a welcome addition it really aids the nihilistic and hopeless tone that smothers this film br br as for what begotten is about the rape of the environment and rebirth theory feels pretty accurate to me but i wouldn't spend a lot of time focusing on the meaning it's virtually unimportant it's clear the director didn't want to explain anything he simply presents it as it is and if you want to search for a meaning that's up to you br br watching begotten is definitely not a walk in the park but i was captivated from the opening it really is like watching a person's worst nightmare what we see is at times distressing and very unpleasant but there is a surreal dreamlike beauty in there if you're an art house experimental fan and you haven't yet seen begotten make it a priority i doubt you will ever forget it i sure know that i won't
<START> having been raised in canada i saw this short many times mostly on the cbc i have seen it numerous times at many ages in my life and each time the reactions are the same it is a joyous bittersweet beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart i am sure i have it on some vhs tape somewhere digging around br br every kid growing up can relate to the situation and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols the scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless i haven't seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short has br br sure i am a montreal fan and that makes my appreciation for it more special but in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey and the memories of your family telling you that you should be for what you get even if it isn't exactly what you wanted and oh yeah the animation is beautiful too br br rating 10 out of 10
<START> i saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed it although there were several clues which i could realize after second time watching i was not able to awake the dawn case maybe this was my carelessness the subconsciousness of a woman was became concrete with 'let me go key sentence of the film let me go out from deep deep inside of your brain and we will both be free a discrete film that forcing the limits of human conscious and brain anybody who have seen the would realize the similarities with breaking dawn a man that could not escape from his conscience again a psychological and an abstract concept meets it in an human body and he will just be free of accepting and realizing there is no way of escape also i want to mention about the performances of dawn's stuffs in spite of having not many experiences from actors and actresses to director all exhibited separately reasonable performance that have created a synergy which would increase the quality of the movie
<START> this demented left wing wipe out trivializes dante's great work distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition inserts hateful ideology incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place and itself deserves a place in the eighth circle tenth with the rest of the has reserved himself a spot next to it br br stocking hell with republican political figures fox news helicopters and christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege to say nothing of extreme liberal bias it is however unoriginal tedious and trite nothing in unworthy and heretical revision is in the least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining humorous or enlightening despite his smug pretension to the contrary br br i could have eaten a reel of video tape and puked a better movie i regret the two hours of my life that i lost watching this insult to the very concept of poetry will weep forever
<START> the 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun sometimes there were some definite brains behind it all evil dead ii night of the creeps and return of the living dead for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends movies like pieces and blood diner stacked rental shelves in the 80's and 90's offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment kevin 1988 movie night of the demons is a part of this tradition stupid poorly acted and not an original bone in it's body but dammit if you don't have a good time br br the plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80's a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20's decide to go to a party at hull house thrown by angela mimi kinkade and suzanne scream queen legend linnea quigley well angela and co decide to throw a sÃ©ance this turns out to be as will arrested development character gob would call it a huge mistake because a demonic force soon possesses angela and starts to get to the others as well br br take the evil dead a nightmare on elm street and your average dumb dead teen flick throw them in a blender and night of the demons is what you get the movie is anything but original and really it's not a good movie the whole thing is insanely derivative the acting is terrible the jokes often fall flat the characters are annoying especially the character of stooge and the plot holes are numerous that out of the way it's still a lot of fun so why br br well for one thing the make up and gore effects are top notch with some really memorable moments especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick that really stick out it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously yet with the exception of some terrible puns plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness plus there's a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that's almost impossible to resist yeah it's nothing special but it knows that and it couldn't be more proud of that fact it's a goofy party horror movie and it never pretends to be anything more br br it might not be a classic but night of the demons is a good example of horror junk food done right it might not be too memorable or original but sometimes you don't want a fancy beer sometimes you want a budweiser
<START> lackawanna blues is a fine stage play by ruben santiago hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen this brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors fine music brilliant editing superb direction by george c wolfe and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory yes it is just that good br br the story is based on the author's life as the child marcus carl franklin raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic rachel nanny crosby s a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the south from mental hospitals and from the streets to lackawanna new york the boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house odd characters with painful pasts and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by nanny the myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business terrence howard rosie perez mos def the beautiful carmen louis gossett jr jeffrey wright ernie hudson woodward jimmy patricia macy gray liev schreiber kathleen lou myers hill harper the list goes on and on br br in the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism the history of desegregation the dynamics of drug abuse and violence the infectious joy of african american music contributions to our musical culture and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact s is wholly submerged in this role a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos she offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an hbo movie she without a doubt would add the oscar to place along side her golden globe award br br the entire cast is exceptional and wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master like riffs in a jazz piece he tiny moments of conversation with each character and junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues jazz dancing and joy the production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story highly recommended almost compulsory viewing grady harp
<START> i loved the film eddie monroe the film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it i especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending craig morris has brad pitt potential both in looks and talent his blue eyes reminded me of paul newman's fred carpenter took this movie to a new level i loved the cast the music score cinematography talent locations and script were awesome i loved seeing some of my favorite actors in eddie monroe fred carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director he gives his work 200 the film has great texture i hope that there will be an eddie monroe 2 i would love to see how nicolette turns out after getting her of money fred carpenter's eddie monroe is hollywood level
<START> is this movie as bad as some claim in my opinion yes it is i wasn't going to comment noting that quite a few comments have already been made ranging from 'awful' to not nearly so bad ' however i can't resist br br what do you make of a movie that has on the dvd cover the phrase the real story of ma barker and her boys and the standard any similarity to actual persons disclaimer in the credits i'm not naive but in this case it's a pretty relevant observation regarding this movie br br several comments knock the performances they are pretty awful roberts russell milano and stallone have something like movies and tv shows listed between them they can act or at least perform br br however the dialog is not to my taste and quite unintentionally funny at times the story arcs didn't seem to be anything but the barest minimum required to string specific scenes of violence and melodrama together br br direction and screen writing has to be faulted giggles after seeing ma barker's violent temper and finishes with take the girl what ever you think of acting abilities some screenwriter wrote that line or reaction and or some director shot it and said that's good enough no need to retake that that's credible ' one footnote i did pick up my copy for 1 99 or 2 99 in a grocery story discount bin the running time is shown as 91 mins and i note that the running time is listed on imdb as 95 mins i don't know what 4 minutes i'm missing but i acknowledge that if those 4 minutes were of the right sort of person in the right sort of situation my rating might soar to 3 or 4 out of 10 as i saw it 1 10 is what i must vote
<START> before i begin a little correction imdb states that richard gere is 180 cm tall wrong i passed by him 10 years ago and he can't be an a bigger than 165 i'm 183 and he looked like a child next to me br br should have been called an appropriate title to complement malick's previous and much better movie badlands this movie shows that not all directors have as their prime objective to entertain in fact some of them have as their main objective to show wheat in all its splendour br br the movie is depressing and relatively uninvolving with the obligatory tragic ending nothing more than an average and predictable love triangle drama with the male two thirds of the triangle not surviving the movie praised for its visual quality while it does have that realistic 70s feel to it there are limits to how spellbinding wheat fields can be you can shoot them with 1500 mm cameras for all i care but they are still wheat fields br br gere who at first seems miscast as some kind of lower class factory worker turned worker is quite solid while brooke adams appears distant and cool for most of the movie making one wonder just how much she loved either of the two hunks but for those looking for a movie that displays all the glorious colours of a field of wheat look no further you've found your dream br br if you're interested in reading my biographies of richard gere and other hollywood intellectual heavyweights contact me by e mail
<START> i don't know what the makers of this film were trying to either accomplish or say but they badly failed at whatever it was unless of course the object was to totally confuse the viewer i watched this movie simply because drew barrymore was in it and it turned out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it the whole idea of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sorts of wackos is utterly ridiculous
<START> i watched this movie based on the good reviews here and i won't make that mistake again br br the first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy but you don't see what it is flashback 12 hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen when the ending is finally reveled you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn't happen and means nothing to what you have been watching the only connection these people have is that they have all had a bad day but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom br br if this was supposed to be a crash clone it's a complete failure
