<START> i have always wanted to see the movie because i loved the novel but was warned away because i'd heard that the movie was a stinker it is wrote the script and i could follow it fine despite the fact that i read the novel over thirty years ago br br the soundtrack is execrable jarring jangling and utterly inappropriate breaking any attempt at mystery or mood in the movie i suspect that the director must take a lot of the blame as even michael caine is terrible in it and he was already doing excellent work in alfie a couple of years earlier br br the mysteries evoked by the book are not well translated onto the screen i'd love to see someone remake this one
<START> i had known brad at florida state u in the early 70's when he was an inspiring inventive writer who i thought was headed for greater glory br br and that is why i rented this video well well well the time has not been kind to mr i suppose the pressures of making a living makes higher aspirations expendable another flower whose bloom has come and gone un noticed in the summer breeze amen there is nothing more to say and nothing more to add a sad epitaph to a once blossoming career as stated above but it is the price one pays for chasing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for oneself in life because this movie has no goal no purpose and i kept telling myself what happened to creativity his once shining genius gone gone years of neglect has deteriorated his once shining mind
<START> as a retired usaf msg aircraft spec this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the fact that a teenager could ever get on the flight line much less get into an f 16 is ludicrous the military spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the air force and all its members seem stupid at best yes i know it is only a movie but it conveys a message to the younger folks that we are all idiots and believe me we are not the logistics involved in setting up any type of mission are highly involved even in the eighties military computers were too secure to hack by any teenager and the other flaws in this movie make peter pan more believable sorry to me this movie has no entertainment value at all
<START> i don't know how i would feel if i lived in usa i would watch some preview scenes advertisements i would know sidney pollack directed it harrison ford and kristin scott thomas starring in i would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review would i be disappointment br br i read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was this is boring long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting harrison is wooden cold the should be cut too serious particularly for harrison ford i am interested in the subject and i like harrison ford in the films which are not actions i like sidney pollack and kristin scott thomas too so reading the reviews on imdb website then in other sites then in february in the hungarian movie magazines i was wonder and wonder what the film was anyway there are films directors stars what who i want to see despite any reviews br br i can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion but i feel different it is true i liked sliding doors the forbidden woman this is a french film i don't know what its title in english or in french basic of these films is development of a love br br i think random heart is a nice and interesting film in its own way br br it may be true that the the congress election and the cop's investigation after a corrupt policeman are not written well are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man character after his wife's death and betrayal emotion angry of dutch comes to the surface during his work he will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend then the woman too the film shows two ways to survive the tragedy our wife husband's death and cheating one of them is the woman's this is tragedy but the life is continuing she doesn't want to mourn forever what she wants to know what her husband's lover the cop's wife thought about her she will not learn never she is forced to behave in this way the elections are comes and anything about his husband may become scandal she wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father the man is a cop he suffering from the fact he lived in lies he wants to know maybe every men would want to know in this situation when his wife started to cheat him how long had she got lover he needs the woman's help but she doesn't want but the guy is stubborn and steady persistent the woman can't stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world the tragedy i said it in spite of that they made love in bed however the cop can't stop with investigation can't stop close and can't allow the woman close to him but he starts the love and the woman wants their relationship to continue but it can't the woman realizes it the end is a bit sad but logic and nice at the same time br br it was pleasant for me to see again peter coyote i like this man's face sidney pollack i hardly knew bonnie hunt but she was good br br i think harrison ford did an okay job his is unusual but at the beginning then finally i believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament it was pity he had not got any joke but ford has got a good sense of humour a reviewer noticed in hungary ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice but dr jones is not smiling at us but he smiles at the end and it is soooo good with the rest i agree i very like him in this role he is good in acting of this a bit rough cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop the character of kristin scott thomas is a woman who is determined self confident but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions but she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the cop the two cool reserved people find each other br br maybe the script is not good it is full of common banal sentence but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man it is a good film but not for everybody not for the general big audience i watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better about the latter maybe sidney pollack made this film for his age group which doesn't go to multiplex anyway i advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes who like only ford's action films miss this movie
<START> i must begin by saying that this is one of the most annoying films i have seen in my entire life annoying factor number one never seeing the son's face for the entire movie and the infinitely more annoying factor that incessantly ringing phone nothing but listening to the phone ring over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over you get my point the old man was being harassed but the viewer was too at first the film was interesting to me but it deteriorated very quickly the film may possibly have been good as a short but was definitely not enough to maintain anything approaching feature film length i guess what i am trying to say is that the message about racism which finally put in an appearance during the last two scenes of the movie is secondary to this old mans being harassed who cares to sit and watch what is really nothing more than an old man spouting obscenities at someone prank calling him if you've never seen a movie that just gets under your skin and drives you crazy check this one out
<START> a wonderful film in the best scandinavian magic tradition with very far sighted analysis of much of the big issues we are just starting to face br br should be compulsory viewing for all politicians br br take your pick from privacy nuclear global climate change quality of life br br reminiscent of walden but with modern twist and considerable humour br br i'm not finnish although i've travelled there and have good finnish friends but i found it totally accessible and also culturally informative
<START> i think this tv film was first aired the same week that manchester utd played in the champions league final 1999 they run a lot of football related items that week and this one was an absolute standout br br it played on all the clichÃ©s that are churned out every season during the fa cup ie plucky underdogs lucky clothing mascots name on the cup etc and turned out to be brilliantly funny br br i'm surprised it has never been repeated prior to other big football occasions even now with the world cup just getting underway br br a few previous posts from non football fans have said they still love it but a football fan will find it hilarious imho
<START> once again there's dastardly government agencies stopping at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some momentous events in this case the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the planet's ecology although the creature is no e t he does seem to befriend one youngster who protects it at all costs not realising it is but an infant of the species and is going to get a lot bigger Â and badder this 2005 series had a lot going for it it is family drama sci fi thriller with more than a few comedic moments the characters are believable well acted and well photographed the show holds the attention of course as with any sci fi show suspension of disbelief has to be achieved and i think it is here alas the series crashed after season one so we never get a resolution infuriating there is a general comment i feel worth making here many tv networks and or film distribution companies cancel quite arbitrarily seemingly excellent tv series Â particularly intelligent sci fi ones now there may be some very good reasons for this although the audiences are treated with utmost disdain and rarely told the reasons this in itself is annoying what really gets my goat is that having cancelled the series they then issue the thing as far as it's got on dvd in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible for previous viewers of the series that's ok they know what they're in for but Â many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger two that come to mind immediately are surface and odyssey 5 if you've heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the blasted dvd and end up with an unresolved plot issue Â it makes me very angry i enjoyed surface immensely and didn't realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally untenable Â and we'll never know what happened next i believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such dvd issues to the effect that the story is unfinished nowadays i check on tv series purchases imdb is an obvious excellent starting point to find out whether a 'complete' series is really complete or not buyer beware
<START> i generally like this movie a lot the animation is supreme meaning they took to trouble to animate the hair and fur on animals and people and being an amateur at graphics and animation self teaching myself through books for those who are curious on the same matter i use the program by discreet it is a high quality free program that can be downloaded from the internet i see that the quality of animation shown here is of high standards br br the plot of this movie is good though this movie lacks character development this story is still understandable generally i believe that this movie is primarily should be watched by people who are fans of the game as its plot closely follows the game as for me i do not play the games and therefore i don't have the wowing effect it probably does on fans of the game br br for those who like the game i suggest this movie to you and if you haven't played the game i would still recommend this movie to you
<START> the only reason any of the hundred or so users watched this movie was because they belong to the crew were friends to the crew or were obsessive fans of either lance henriksen or lorenzo lamas i personally follow the cult of lance so i was disappointed to see that despite being the headliner it's in name only playing rich criminal newcastle lance is a joy to watch but all of his screen time is relegated to the beginning of the movie newcastle sets up a 747 heist which includes lamas and a bunch of forgettable characters the biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre heist scenes were not all that bad with the exception of somewhat obnoxious and rather confused looking gale who times every line with the finesse of a grade school play actress acting was decent all around and none of the lines really made me cringe br br but once the heist occurs the movie falls asleep not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured on film but it's dragged out for far too long this isn't a very deep movie and you have to fill out your 90 minutes but these scenes are so boring i nearly nodded off at two in the afternoon one particular sequence in which we watch each and every one of the characters perform the same task over and over again is especially difficult to get through the movie's name is rapid exchange but the exchange is far from rapid it's overlong and bloated to extremes perhaps it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities but come on there's only so much you can ask out of a straight to video movie airing of showtime extreme br br thankfully there are several laughs intentional and unintentional lorenzo lamas is seemingly a master of disguise which makes for a couple of incredibly bizarre scenarios and lance returns in the film's end albeit for a brief period of time it's a bad movie and i probably didn't have to tell you that myself but it's far from the worst thing i've ever seen i wouldn't put it too high on the list of henriksen films since he's been in some real gems with greater screen time and either way the movie loses a lot of steam once the heist begins but the best thing i can say for rapid exchange is that the last two films i watched before it were the mainstream hostage and the overrated pretentious crash and this was better than both
<START> i watched this movie last night and let me say it's the absolute worst thing i have ever seen the entire film is a train wreck and it's not the actors it is the horrible script br br spoilers alright eddie loses his job to a monkey his nerdy son is disappointed the bathroom goes crazy br br he gets a free vacation he goes along with uncle nick and the original audry their boats crashes they stay on an island they are stupid and don't even bother to look at the nearby hotel br br ok so that's that what makes this movie pathetic is the humor it is so horrid and stupid you can't even laugh and it's not stupid funny humor either i couldn't laugh the entire thing
<START> hello everyone all i have to say is that human traffic and all of its characters are so real its funny i live in australia melbourne and i'm finally out of the clubbing and staying out all weekend lifestyle this movie explains everything that is currently going on in the world so exactly that i cant stop watching it i used to be exactly like so my friends said and i hadn't even seen the movie i left the weekend partying behind about 3 months ago after 4 years of intense partying to change my life around i was at a dvd store when i saw human traffic and i remember my old friends going on an on about it so i bought it to see what all the fuss was about i was so into it i watched it 4 times in a row because i couldn't believe that someone had made a movie that explains everything to a t anyways this movie is by far the best and funniest movie i have ever seen its funny because its so truthful in everything that goes on in the movie and is a legend thats all i have to say enjoy 11 10 blew my socks off at how real it was its exactly whats going on in the world hr rm i jabber a lot br br take care everyone
<START> i consider saboteur as hitchcock's first american film because the story takes place completely in u s br br there are brilliant scenes in this film statue of liberty scene barry kane jumping into the water from the bridge water fall scene are amazing its not hitchcock's fault that he didn't get the actors he wanted hitchcock originally wanted gary cooper for the leading roles in foreign correspondent and saboteur but gary cooper wasn't interested in doing a thriller another reason why hitchcock didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of top directors although rebecca was a huge success still most of film's success went to producer david o selznick for example david o selznick got best picture oscar for rebecca and hitchcock didn't get a best director oscar for rebecca hitchcock started getting some attention after foreign correspondent 1940 but universal gave him a low budget for saboteur 1942 hitchcock tried to get joel mccrea for this film because he was willing to work with hitchcock again with a low salary he enjoyed working with hitchcock in foreign correspondent 1940 but he was unavailable so the role went to robert cummings hitchcock called robert cummings a competent performer i thought he did his best he was a less known actor who was willing to play a role when many big actors refused to play the leading male role br br as for leading female role hitchcock wanted margaret sullavan or barbara stanwyck for the leading role they weren't interested either so universal decided to give the role to priscilla lane i read in a book that this was one of her favorite films br br i also liked the scene at blind man's house that is my favorite scene if we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in uncle philip's house then we will see how intense it is uncle philip blind man was studying barry kane's character the moment he entered his house the moment barry entered his house he heard barry's handcuffs through conversation he realized that barry kane isn't a criminal at all we also see his hearing ability through those scenes for example barry hears the sound of a car says is that a car coming uncle philip says 2 cars i think uncle philip was right we see 2 cars in the next scene priscilla lane did a fine job playing her role she was no big star but i thought her performance was really good another brilliant scene in uncle philip's house is the scene where he asks priscilla lane patricia martin are you frightened pat is that what makes you so cruel i thought otto krueger played the villain brilliantly hitchcock wanted harry carey for the villain but he refused harry carey is famous for his role mr president in mr smith goes to washington i want to mention more about this film but i think my post is getting too long br br every hitchcock film is special in its own way i am sure hitchcock fans will like this film i rate 10 out of 10
<START> ignore everyone else's comments for this movie and watch it on pay cable like i did or rent it you owe it to yourself this film is what movies are supposed to be all about hard to categorize and god knows how this was pitched as a high concept but this is one for the angels check it out what have you got to lose
<START> this movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama about two guys who worked in a butcher's shop and wanted to build up their own when they finally fulfilled that dream they faced a new problem there were no clients one day by accident one guy dies in the refrigerator room and a new kind of butcher's business beginsÂ they start selling human flesh saying to the clients it's just and their business starts to improve human flesh sells good oh i forgot to say somethingÂ these guys aren't normal there's really something missing in their brains br br the movie has some nice dark humour scenes but it is in my opinion mostly a drama one that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath what are his motivations to what he does i must confess i was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie because i never expected they could make it without been discovered but that's probably because i see too many hollywood what i mean by this is that in hollywood's cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the bad things there's always a morality protecting the good values in spite of we all know that in real life it doesn't happen this way too many and i liked this movie mostly because of that because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true frontal without fake and which see what is on the other side behind the conventional morality Â it just happens in independent cinema especially in the european br br besides there're excellent performances by nikolaj lie kass and mads especially the first one in the roles of the disturbed guys Â br br very nice danish film
