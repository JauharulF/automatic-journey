<START> leos carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that x is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever seriously if i could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor i would have thrashed pierre to within an inch of his life no one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid both at the same time except maybe heathcliff in emily bronte's wuthering heights after spending 134 minutes with pierre i need a large glass of brandy never have i been so angry at a main character ok having said that x is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes i've ever seen in any film which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking and i'm talking graphic here by the way x will beat the hell out of you though so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it
<START> i think this movie was made as good as it could have been with only 4 months and a budget i'm surprised this wasn't worse if you are not to care about the cg or special effects this movie is great br br okay the movie is not that well made i'm sure it could have been but you try to do better in only 4 months but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting br br don't trust me when i say that this movie is good cause i also find the 1933 king kong to be good br br i must confess that i didn't watch the complete movie either i might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there
<START> spanish director luis buÃ±uel career spanned almost 50 years from 1929 to 1977 arguably his best films were those he made during his exile in mexico from the late forties to the early 60s there he had to deal with very cheap budgets and work in an industry interested mainly in churning commercial movies to unsophisticated audiences yet he somehow managed to make interesting thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time this movie is based on a novel by spanish author benito perez and the adaptation is quite faithful even if the setting is now early 20th century mexico instead of early 20th century spain the protagonist is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by christ the question many would ask is whether such endeavor would be possible without incurring in the hostility and mockery of your fellow human beings as it happens he suffers a lot of indignities yet he remains stubborn until the controversial final shot to this objective i think buÃ±uel wanted to show as a somewhat ridiculous figure but perhaps inadvertently his stubbornness at least to this viewer comes out as admirable in any case a great film
<START> i adore the chaney version of phantom and i appreciate webber's version if only for the growing interest in the book wish i find more of a mystery slash horror with the romantic aspects downplayed i don't approve of the fact that andrew lloyd webber made the relationship between raoul and christine less restrained br br luckily since this is a comedic short with only erik and christine this version doesn't even have to bother with any other characters br br i thought i would still be waiting for another version to match up performance i was dead wrong leslie nielson is fabulous as erik though of course this is a spoof it's still brilliant br br i especially appreciated the fact that erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim i still have as of yet to see a phantom like that other than br br however i do not recommend this short if you don't like spoofs because this is in no way supposed to be taken seriously
<START> for many the hit series was ten years of pitch black humour loaded with affectionate parodies of classic films and a hilarious assortment of over a hundred characters with instantly recognisable catchphrases few shows have survived transition from radio to tv to stage show to film but the league of gentlemen have achieved it with suitable aplomb br br the talented writer performers had initially envisioned a monty python style medieval adventure but as soon as writing began they soon realised that the characters they have lived with had become very real and deserved better with that the royston vasey folk realise their very existence is under threat as the writers decide to disregard the fictitious town and work on a 17th century romp instead br br with the exception of michael sheen playing much unseen league member jeremy dyson the league play pretty unlikeable caricatures of their real life personae as well as the familiar faces of tubbs i made a little brown fishy nightmare inducing sexual predator herr butcher hilary briss and an unlikely hero irate businessman geoff new faces appear when the third reality appears it's here we are treated to charming and funny cameos from veteran actors and popular tv stars for many this will be a really enjoyable 90 minutes br br is not going to please everyone though working on this level of post modernism has been done a few times before now and may seem all too familiar to audiences raised on irony drenched teen successes kick started by the likes of wes craven having a new nightmare it also takes a lot of confidence in an audience to keep up with a high concept story so there are moments of exposition and dialogue that serve only to confirm what most in the audience already know comedy as a genre is formulaic but it's now unheard of for a british film not to fall back on the huge back catalogue of tv stars to fill short amounts of screen time it's also hard to believe the creators ever wanted their offspring killed off which is perhaps why some of the role reversal doesn't always quite hit the mark would hilary briss have wanted to try save royston vasey in the series br br however while the show's deliciously dark vein has almost all but disappeared but is arguably more accessible for it much will be said about the character development and efforts to humanise the likes of previously one joke incarnations like herr it is here an impossible level of depth can be found along with a harsh streak of biting satire and throwaway put downs sentiment is there with a lump in the throat but not sugar coated thickly enough to intrude on the action the music is good performances exemplary and the animation is wonderfully seamless a nice throwback to terry gilliam and ray work in short there's a lot to like about the apocalypse like so many tv to film transfers it was never going to be easy finding the line between preaching to the converted and introducing the uninitiated to the slick and distinct voice but no matter what your preference is this last trip to the town which never leave' is oddly lined with hope and ultimately very very touching
<START> what i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid so undeserving so tasteless as to deserve these kind of cons there is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today's cgi effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them with that allure we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction well guess what the only mayhem we saw was in the ads touting next episode what a let down but wait there was even a bigger one the script itself was the bigger disaster and then there was the direction and the flaccid acting by everyone involved in this turkey but we knew this before right we knew that effects alone do not an entertainment make but yet the network bozos who this tv movie didn't care about that because in their mantra is the everlasting line never underestimate how stupid the audience are these guys must actually live by this motto and i am so fed up of it no wonder the audience has abandoned us drama in droves and pitched their camp in reality shows at least in those programs no one is trying to make it look like anything different from what it is intellectual pornography well category 6 is worse than that because it assumes to be different and original yes this was a disaster movie alright but the disasters are not what they advertised
<START> i just watched descent what an awful movie right off the bat they depict a lava geyser and a note says that it is miles below the the surface of washington state folks there are no geysers deep in the earth like that they thought it looked neat and in typical hollywood style they threw it in and then there is that well that spewed lava he dropped a stone and i heard a splash steam would have erupted out of that well before a blast of lava could if ever br br and the acting was pretty bad as well micheal dorn has sunk to a new low in jobs br br what a dog of a movie i bet the vote goes no higher than a 3 5 br br it didn't look like scifi channel spent too much other than to have pretty boy perry as an attempt to draw
<START> why did they not follow the book i am really sad and disappointed i was so looking forward to seeing this movie however if you have read the book maybe recently it might be very difficult to remain objective my wife had not read the book and she loved the movie br br reasons for the disappointment are 1 involvement gone with the wind such a shame there is a very small part at the start where the antimatter is created but even that does not stick to the facts why not the fact that father was burned with the first brand which is how langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the movie 2 story line between the deceased pope and completely gone this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3 story line between langdon and completely non existent br br all in all too flaky storyline and cannot understand that dan brown allowed them to put his name against it maybe i should revisit this film in 10 years time when i cannot remember the excellent book anymore fat chance on forgetting the book i am afraid br br really sorry for the negative review which was spoilt by expectations
<START> this movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost story and suspense thriller conventions none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating the script was perfunctory the acting ditto the scary fx were mostly laughable except for one exquisite seat jumper moment that scared me even though i saw it coming a mile off now explain to me someone why you would need ghosts and black magic and arcane ritual objects and count cg and psychic investigators and family curses and irish superstitions and bowls of milk left out for the supernatural beings and possessed all in the same movie with all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror but this movie is lame lame lame
<START> navy seals is an ignorant racist and complacent movie which thoughtlessly uses the middle east conflict as the backdrop for an action flick concocted for a comfortably sheltered american mid west audience the conflict as well as those involved is used simply as cannon fodder to glorify the photogenic young americans who proudly kill arabs for the good of 'freedom' but what is worse is that the film's action scenes are sloppily handled and unexciting which prevents navy seals from working even as a mindless shoot 'em up br br charlie sheen's character hawkins is disgusting obnoxious ignorant reckless and above all racist he refers to the middle east as a 's t hole' and to its inhabitants as heads' throughout the film the navy characters are glorified through the use of the lebanese natives as cannon fodder they indiscriminately massacre these people with a consequence free attitude there is even the tasteless murder of a young lebanese boy who is shot by hawkins hawkins makes fun of his language before shooting him whilst making another humorous quip besides being tasteless this should be unacceptable the film's extreme though predictable pro american stance is also revolting this can be seen when the lebanese american female journalist informs hawkins that terrorists cant be made to talk because 'they are religious zealots ' hawkins then retorts with 'yeah and we are the navy seals ' the implication is obviously that zealots are meaningless next to american military might moreover even after insulting this journalist's racial heritage and treating her like a sex object the script demands her inability to resist this disgusting thug and she still ends up sleeping with him because he is an all american navy seal this marginalizes the journalist's character by making her submissive to the pro american attitude of hawkins despite his insulting behaviour toward her beyond ethics this plot twist also has little credence as drama br br the screenplay is also amateurish most scenes are simply strung together without any thought for mood plot or character development the 'music video' scene at the golf course for example is just shoddily edited eye candy and the two scenes where charlie sheen plays the reckless hero are also pointless in one he jumps off a bridge from moving car just to show his mates how tough he is and in the other he chases down a tow truck on a push bike and drives his car off it neither scene has a follow up anti climax both are highly improbable and neither has any bearing on the plot as a whole they are just candy designed as a vehicle to showcase hawkins' cheap all american heroics and are poor substitutes for character development most of the other plot development scenes are also badly filmed and poorly scripted as in fact this affliction affects the entire movie apart from the african american navy seal and his wife as well as the characters of michael biehn and charlie sheen every other member of the team seems unknown to the audience so that when the climatic scenes roll around there seems to nobody to root for and anybody's death to lament br br in such a film the action sequences can potentially rescue the production but here they don't these are badly directed badly lit and showcase badly performed stunts in fact their direction is so poor that they are almost incoherent to the viewer resulting in not only the scenes being incomprehensibly hard to follow but also in a complete lack of fear and suspense poor lighting only adds to their impotence the explosions look fake gunshot wounds unconvincing and one of the more daring stunts involving crashing a mercedes over a tank looks just like a stunt which has been staged on a backlot and then poorly edited br br the ending of navy seals places the coins firmly on the eyes of this production first there is the obligatory slow motion away from the big explosion that should have killed me' scene with sheen carrying biehn on his back this was obviously the default scene intended to be the star of the movie's trailers then there is the ending itself when the of the seal team wounded and floating in the ocean are rescued by a submarine this submarine had in fact turned for home long before but of course it had miraculously returned in the nick of time topping it all of despite the violent and stressful ordeal and despite the fact that numerous of their colleagues had just been killed with a number of them still bleeding acutely they all manage to laugh heartily while blessing america predictable you can just imagine this ending while watching the opening credits br br this movie indulgently uses the middle eastern conflict as a vehicle for the macho all american tendencies of the movies' photogenic young leads arabs are treated condescendingly and dismissively and their slaughter in the movie is used as a to glorify the use of american military might against an 'inferior' minority group in a consequence free environment the events of 2001 have pointed out that such smug and overconfident trivialising of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a consequence free the middle east can no longer be written off as a s t hole full of rag heads knocking each other off to quote charlie sheen here it is now a place in which involvement can lead to severe consequences today we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can manifest themselves quite close to home therefore in the very least navy seals looks pretty foolish these days but this is to be kind this is a highly ignorant movie whose production values and professionalism are equally suspect navy seals is ideologically and artistically a complete insult to the intelligence of its audience
<START> i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey 'tarzan' concept made so popular by hollywood weismuller et al br br yes there is a lot of silly stuff but then the idea is silly it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees i am tempted to say completely unbelievable but that the concept has never been tried and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood br br still if you can get your head around that lot there's a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play there are plenty of other excellent performances too not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holm br br what is particularly disturbing and rightly so is the simian perception of humans we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor dumb helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it and it demonstrates well how the phony and with which we cloak and justify our conduct is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance it may seem a little overstated at times especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms but what we see isn't just a truth about the victorians its a truth about the way we are today it's one that needs to be stated and cannot be stated often enough holm's character's obsession with the 'ray as a symptom of civilisation as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned is an excellent case in point primitive bearded readers take note br br the story is depressing ultimately it's a tragedy because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human we know he's doomed before the third millennium is 50 years old wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to insatiable human excess br br in the end it's a tale about ourselves the path to extinction that other simians tread must eventually be followed by humans br br highly recommended for its ethical take despite the hokey moments
<START> normally i hate period films living in england is a nightmare at the moment if you have an allergy to period dramas which i do however this one is the best it doesn't take itself seriously and jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are great together liv tyler's good as well although her english accent is dodgy br br the film has everything for someone who just wants to go the cinema to enjoy themselves it has action adventure drama and comedy i'm not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean but hopefully they will it would be a shame for american audiences to miss out on this film it shows that english film makers can produce something that doesn't involve constant swearing and sex both do feature in this but in a balanced format robertson's camp portrayal of the well to do gentleman is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class set are hilarious br br as the trailer for 'the spy who shagged me' is to say if you see one other film this spring make it and it's got fun action and of course jonny lee miller with an english accent for a change
<START> i should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art because they are human beings and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature that said the simplistic notion that ingmar bergman's great 1968 film shame or is merely an anti war film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film compared to its more filmically predecessors persona and hour of the wolf shame is seemingly a more classic film in terms of narrative but the key word is seemingly for while it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of persona and the gaudy horror film homages of hour of the wolf it is one of the best films ever made about war and not as an anti war film nor a pro war film as such it has to rank with wild strawberries as one of his greatest films as well as one of his best screenplays if not the best br br although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that preceded it it truly says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive in it max von sydow and liv ullman play jan and eva rosenberg perhaps a nod at the infamous american spies whom many european intellectuals felt were innocent two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on an island content to working in a greenhouse the country they live in is unnamed as is the island they live on although the film was made on bergman's small island of just off the northern end of the swedish island of it seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province this is all left deliberately hazy as this war is meant to symbolize all wars this is reinforced as the film starts with assorted war quotes on the screen as the credits roll these include quotes from hitler to vietnam era american military figures after early scenes that depict the prosaic nature of their rural life and then the coming of war where even old men are conscripted an aerial attack ravages the land as enemy jets fly overhead dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an agent orange like nature one plane is hit and a jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree jan who starts off the film as a sniveling coward refuses to go and help so eva goes alone jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot it seems he is indeed part of the invading or possibly rebel force a bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot then advise the couple to leave their home as the invaders are there are the misinterpretations of the film on a micro level such as that of bergman scholar marc gervais who provides the film commentary on the dvd of the film like many other critics he claims that jacobi is a who has collaborated with the invaders but this is clearly and demonstrably wrong for jacobi is with the original fascist government as proof first off the invaders are repelled after they invade the land and shoot their agitprop interview we know this because the government that later questions them of the faked interview and words put into eva's mouth see the film as supposed proof of their treason and jacobi is clearly working with them the fascist big brother secondly jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the townsfolk are sent to concentration camps for collaborating with the invaders and the again are among those spared thirdly in his seduction of eva jacobi tells her his son is on leave from the military and clearly if he was an invader he would not be speaking so happily of his son serving the state also rebel forces are not official armies and do not grant official leave lastly filip is clearly with the rebels or invaders of the organization and why would he have killed a colleague br br that gervais and other critics so blatantly and wantonly and flat out miss such a key and manifest point of this film brings into question their ability to discern any and all aspects of all of bergman's films this is a wonderful and great film and very high in the berman canon but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers have really understand its complex message instead opting out for the cheap lazy and easy claim of its being merely anti war and a rather simple film in comparison to its two predecessors and that in the long run is the real shame of shame
<START> l'appartement has to be among the best french films i have ever seen along with hatred also starring vincent cassel and those great gerard dÃ©pardieu pierre richard movies cassel and bellucci are amazing in the leading roles aside from brotherhood of the wolves and dobermann i have not yet seen a bad movie with this couple l'appartement sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you thrilled until the very end fragment storytelling really hasn't worked this well since pulp fiction let's just hope there won't be a godawful american remake of this unique romance mystery thriller edit guess what a godawful american remake has been made
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as personable as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by golly i'll be writing those recipes down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
