<START> i don't know why this has gotten any decent reviews as it could be the weakest horror comedy i've ever seen englund is just in it for a cameo and his performance is as unnecessary as most of the lame attempts at jokes and scares the direction is terrible and the acting is worse it seems like every year producers are trying to make another evil dead but these weak unoriginal attempts are just stepping on the memory of a true horror classic br br whether its filmmakers saying this isn't a remake but its an 80s throwback which is just as unoriginal in my opinion hatchet or people trying to plug this with other horror classics its still misleading and wont make up for the lack of scares horror comedy or even a decent movie for that matter br br avoid at all costs
<START> i have seen this movie since i was a little girl and being from new york and remembering how people lived back then brought back a lot of good memories this movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person woman and provider claudine attempted to be it was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation it was about the injustice of a system that invaded and put demands on a family to stay afloat diane carroll was nominated for an oscar for this role and it was well deserved if you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments enjoy claudine your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind and understand the overall frustration
<START> i first saw this film in video form even on a television screen the vistas were impressive seen on the big screen in its full glory it must have blown people away br br as one or two other comments have pointed out the story of the early pioneers and how they got around the problems of terrain etc on the road to oregon is as authentic as any film can be it therefore shows that it is totally unnecessary to take liberties with the truth something that today's film makers should take heed of reality is enough br br the plot relies on the struggle of man against the elements and hostile natives subplots are few and simple but the basic plot is enough elsewhere i have reviewed paramount's rival to the big trail fighting caravans in spite of having a more sophisticated plot and having better actors fighting caravans lacks the breathtaking scenes br br the big trail should be compulsory viewing
<START> when i went to the video rental store back in the days when dvd was yet next to unknown to me i had seen all the movies at the store that i was interested in or so i thought the man behind the counter told me he had something for me that i definitely would like he gave me and at first i doubted it to be any good but i trusted his advise and man i sure am happy i did take this jewel along this is one of the best adventure movies in years if you ask me of course with robert carlyle as a major part how bad can a movie get surely liv tyler does once more what she's good at and nothing much more being pretty but still you can very clearly sense that the cast apparently had a lot of fun making this movie
<START> otto preminger's the man with the golden arm is a reference to heroin addiction something that must have been rather risky to film back in 1955 fifty years ago the censors today still have a problem with drug content in films br br the lead role was originally offered to marlon brando then snatched by frank sinatra before brando could respond sinatra convincingly portrays a pro card dealer and ex heroin addict who returns home to the city only to find himself battling the demons of temptation br br preminger is one of my favorite directors his anatomy of a murder starring james stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama preminger pretty much helped change the face of cinema back in the '50s anatomy of a murder was extremely controversial when it came out due to both its plot and content references to rape women's panties seduction etc and the man with the golden arm deals with a topic that is equally volatile br br however preminger pulls it off without becoming exploitative this is like a forerunner to the panic in needle park 1971 and bears more than a few similarities in terms of general motifs to the classic billy wilder movie lost weekend starring ray milland these three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism predating the 1980s and still remain relevant today
<START> two years after the success of 'airplane' jim abrahams and jerry david zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great leslie nielsen as plain clothed detective 'frank also in the cast was alan north as 'captain ed ed williams as and william as 'johnny the shoe shine boy' 'police squad ' featured unashamedly corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame in which the characters in frame stand completely still one of the best sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still causing the cup to overflow guest stars were killed off in the opening titles one included georg stanford brown being crushed by a falling safe despite gaining positive reviews and much critical acclaim ' only lasted for six episodes before being cancelled this didn't mean the end though five years later the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the 'naked gun' films
<START> tu pa tam is one of the worst movies i've ever seen but on the other hand is better then most of the movies from slovenia who are filled with depressing characters and story without any bright ideas tu pa tam is bright optimistic and without any artistic moments in many interviews director tried to tell us that his movie is top quality just because it didn't cost a lot of money but thinking that way is wrong tu pa tam is for me very bad movie the dialogs are really bad written 90 of the script is consisted of cursing the characters are stereotypical morons the story and its twists are very predictable and the action sequences this movie supposed to be an action comedy are filmed very very bad and without any style is just thinking he's even bigger than quentin tarantino so he's copying his style over all 90 minutes the humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive probably thinks that constant cursing is funny in my opinion is tu pa tam very cheap not only by budget movie with stupid story and very very bad acting
<START> the beguiled is a pretty satisfying film for those who are after the things above for clint eastwood's die hard fans it will be a disappointment although eastwood does his best here in his so atypical role except for the fact that his character is a charming womanizer which he isn't so unacquainted with the ambiguous nature of his character which goes from being a sort of fallen hero to a manipulative and insatiable woman eater to put it that way will eventually be too much to handle for anyone used to see him play heroes in the best western tradition morally a bit unclean but still without that dark side i think he manages to pull this unlikely part off but those who really steal the show are the two women the geraldine page and the head of the students played by elizabeth hartman br br we see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire hartman's edwina is the sweetest most innocent girl in the world until she becomes infatuated with john and becomes possessive of him this is what causes tragedy as well as the secret lust the forbidden fruit she carries a great and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother whom she clearly idolizes still the fourth factor in this unholy love spiral is the wicked carol played by jo ann harris who lures john away from his crush on edwina and into her bed br br the whole nature of the story gives this film a sort of gothic feel which makes it a pretty rare thing in the western genre but a popular thing in the movies of the 70's a unique achievement by the siegel eastwood team and a movie not for the faint hearted
<START> sir has played lear over 200 times but tonight he can't remember his opening lines sitting at the mirror his eyes reflect the king's madness his dresser prompts him gently mouthing the words there is an air of desperation about both these men the great actor knowing his powers are slipping away his valet cum major cum conscience cum surrogate wife aware of his boss's decline into madness and knowing he is powerless to do more than ease his passing the dresser is really a love story between the two over the years they have become mutually dependent on one another to the extent that neither can conceive a future without the other set during the second world war it concerns the fortunes of a frankly second rate touring shakespearean company comprising an equal number of has beens and wannabes led by sir a theatrical knight of what might kindly be called the old school whatever part he is playing he grabs centre stage and bellows out over the bullying his audience into applause but somewhere inside him buried most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly dishes out there still remains an occasional glitter of his earlier greatness it is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences fervently hope for mr a finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham often to the point of caricature and just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluster he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realise that a great actor is playing a great actor the same goes for mr t it's easy to write off his portrayal br br of norman as an exercise in stereotyping here we have a middle aged effeminate rather than camp theatrical dresser his way through life enjoying the company of the girls and loving the wicked insider gossip rife in the theatre there were and i strongly suspect still are many men just like norman in the profession infinitely kind and patient knowing more about the plays than many of the actors they run backstage with wisdom and affection i believe the vast majority of them would hoot with approving laughter at mr portrait i saw the dresser on the london stage where against the perceived wisdom mr norman was rather more subdued than in the movie sir was played by the great mr freddie jones to huge acclaim from the audience it was a memorable performance that overshadowed mr reducing him rather to an also ran as opposed to an actor on level billing the idea that sir and norman might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window norman was reduced to being his puppet which i'm not sure was what ronald harwood intended but made for breathtaking theatre messrs finney and redress the balance in the movie restoring equality to the relationship both men have come a long way since their early appearances in the british new wave pictures when they became the darlings of the vaguely middle class and ashamed of it movement when the british cinema virtually committed hari kiri in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door with the renaissance of more substantial movies they re appeared blinking in the unaccustomed bright light br br the dresser marked their return still fizzing with energy and talent shouting to the world at large we're still here it's not a big movie but is assuredly a great one
<START> i must have been in a good mood to give this shameful predictable embarrassing movie even a 3 what's wrong with it let's start with the gratuitous sex although i admit the style of was something i had not seen nor experienced before and i guess they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times then there are the inconsistencies the tribune seems to be in a green part of whatever town it was supposed to be hamilton ontario yet in the scenes on the roof it appears to be in an industrial area with a steel mill belching smoke and flames also the inside of the building the the seem much bigger than the outside spoilers here then when our intrepid reporter finally gets fired she comes back to the building several times once after hours hardly likely the ending is also pitifully predictable the classic bait and switch caper in which the good guy turns out to be the bad guy but my major objection is the fact this is yet another movie financed with canadian and ontario tax credits which is ashamed to set itself in canada yet again proving that the canadian film industry is craven and opportunistic a country's movies must do more than just provide jobs they should reflect the culture it's bad enough that the american studios use toronto as a stand in for new york but it is embarrassing and infuriating when canadian producers in this case global do it with help from the federal and provincial governments in a word bah
<START> night of the demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good low budget can be sure much of it is fairly predictable but somehow it's still much more enjoyable than the crap we see these days being passed off as horror i give the gore a solid 9 and the one liners are actually funny i'm still creeped out by stop looking at me the soundtrack is well done i was surprised to hear stigmata martyr from bauhaus there is also some very nice t a on display as well as some hella good make up effects the second film in the series is pretty good too but avoid the inferior third one night of the demons may be dated dark and low rent but it still has a lot of potential it's definitely worth a rental at least give it a chance tonight just stay away from any old makeup you'll understand when you see it
<START> i should have known when i heard anne rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me i couldn't have predicted that years after it's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry the novels are amazing and while i understand much gets lost in the translation to screen this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work i hope one day someone tries again the right way starting with the vampire lestat they change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason they destroy history the acting of the queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy but i just can't bring myself to laugh the charm and allure of the novels just isn't there the movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and dark imagery as possible into one movie hoping the teeny of america would lap it up part of the appeal of the first movie of louis' story is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world thank goodness i read the books first or i'd have never touched them after this movie
<START> br br very good 1970s movie about mob operations in new jersey when a maverick gangster doesn't play by the rules of the neighborhood sooner or later it's time for elimination br br joe pesci was true to his character smooth and funny he only gets better with age his face and present day fame should not have been used on the dvd cover to sell this b grade movie as he was only the third billed star br br dated 1970's printed wide lapel shirts and lesser quality background music make for a distraction nice to see the 1970's big cars br br however the acting is good br br nakedness on the part of anne johns was not needed to make this mob story work and she does not show up in the database as every acting again in any film other than this one too bad she did a good job br br moral of the story don't get your don upset with you br br if you are wanting to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night then check out this dvd it was part of a three movie on one dvd 5 88 special at the local discount store br br
