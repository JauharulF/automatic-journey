<START> rabbit fever is one of those film oddities it's an enjoyable 90 minutes demands little of the viewer and delivers as much and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot i think that rabbit fever would be rather well received which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas br br the movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the rabbit vibrator the film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product the narrative is 100 tongue in cheek throughout br br the storyline is strong an introduction to some well rounded and likable characters some enjoyable back story peripheral characters and situations develops into an engaging story and pleasing conclusions sadly there's nothing that feels clever or new br br rabbit fever has some sharp moments a few switches that hint at what the writers are capable of and all credit to them it's not just 90 minutes of knob gags and innuendo i could probably watch it with my mother but there's a laziness about some of the scenes that holds it back those moments went you are up for it when you want it to be outrageous and all you get is a dollop of sit com br br i chuckled i left the theatre feeling empathy for the characters but i also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute reel of made for tv light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema br br i think rabbit fever achieves some of what it set out to do it's a quirky subject a rounded storyline a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes but there's nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a movie theatre environment quite the opposite a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer chance to grab a breath of life that rabbit fever seems to lack
<START> by the time the hellraiser franchise was reaching it's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin dr paul merchant bruce ramsey is a scientist in the future whom while prisoner regales his captor of the story of how his ancestors all played by ramsey had first built the evil lament configuration puzzle box that sets evil upon the world and how his bloodline had subsequent dealing with said box the film is a awash with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of coherency in this one yes this could be due to a combination of rewrites massive cuts in the original version of the film or what have you but i'm reviewing the film as is and not what it was or could have been and as it is now it's a mess sure the franchise will go on indefinitely with direct to dvd sequels but this one was pretty much a death nail to it's chances of getting a new one released theatrically ever again br br my grade d
<START> there are so many '10 best' lists which could easily fit the dead best screen drunk best literary adaptation best use of music not specifically written for the film best use of poetry best screen speech best ensemble cast and finally perhaps best film ever made this was john huston's last and greatest film adapted by his son tony from james joyce's short story and set on the evening of the feast of the epiphany in the dublin of 1904 it is confined largely to one setting the home of the sisters and not a great deal happens in conventional terms they entertain their guests there is singing dancing and much small talk but watching this film you can't imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this company br br finally of course it is much much more it is about love loss and regret those stable mainstays of great drama in the film's closing scenes the tenor d'arcy frank patterson sings a song 'the lass of which conjures up in the mind of gretta anjelica huston wife of gabriel donal mccann the ghost of her first and probably greatest love a boy who died in all certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen and suddenly gabriel realises he has never really known his wife and that he has not been the great love of her life after all emotionally these scenes are incredibly powerful firstly as gretta recounts the circumstances of her lover's death and then as the voice in gabriel's head sums up his own feelings this is great cinema the monologues superbly delivered by huston and mccann br br but then all the performances are extraordinary this is ensemble playing of the highest order and while it would be invidious to single out one performer above another has the screen ever given us a more likable genial or convincing drunk than donal donnelly or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that sean the ira man in the quiet man brings to his reading of lady gregory's translation of here added poignancy is to be had of course from the knowledge that huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me the culmination of his life's work death may well be its central theme but viewing this film is a life enhancing experience
<START> i have read a couple of reviews of this film which has recently been released on dvd by eclectic apparently the opening titles are letterboxed but the remainder most is full screen the first release in 1982 by planet video is completely letterboxed though it was a primitive release it did get the compositions right later releases had sharper and better picture quality but they were fullscreen as the dvd is any release of this film should be letterboxed as it adds significantly to the visual experience of the old planet tape
<START> i endured this film just to satisfy my curiosity it has to be one of the worst films i have ever sat through i am amazed that this film currently has a 7 5 star rating the acting is awful script is non existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow for a funny film i cannot remember even snickering once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy do yourself a favour and stay well away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you far greater pleasure check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience i sincerely hope more educated film goers vote negatively for this film in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly
<START> well this was a complete waste of celluloid the preview was promising but after watching the movie it looked like the preview was the whole movie no plot no clear storyline just some misplaced suspense it looks like the director tried very hard to create an atmosphere of mystique and fear but still there are gaps to be filled why the drugs why the number 11 11 btw as sarah the library the clock says 11 14 what's the connection to the murder on the parents what's the role of this woman is she one of the children or not who are those children anyway there is a lot of material lying around to create the ultimate cult movie like the omen but the director just leaves them lying on the floor without digging into the story even the project was more scary than this one all the gaps you hope to be filled like in the butterfly effect stay open as the credits start rolling ok off to the next movie
<START> was a college acting class exercise filmed and released as a movie the formulaic posturing and stylized drivel of a horror soap opera for people who don't like horror films but wish to be able to tell that friends that yes they did see a horror movie it even features soap opera music br br do books falling off library shelves scare you do doors shutting terrify you then this flick is for you have you ever been kidnapped yeah most of us have when you were raped was it simply ignored because the rapist was the cool kid what's scary is not this movie but this filmmaker's view of the world br br and then the little twists aren't even original this is a film for people who've never seen a horror film before who don't want to see one now and who want to see another flick about everyone conspiring against the weird kid
<START> father hood is an overlooked little gem of a road movie fine performances by halle berry sabina lloyd and brian bonsall two really fun over the top ones by diane ladd and michael ironside br br and a downright outstanding one from patrick swayze the movie is helped by an unconventional storyline but badly undercut by it's flashback framing which results in a abrupt ending father hood would have worked much better without these bookends nevertheless the movie brings up important issues of family responsibilities and the consequences of state intervention as long as the foster system rewards state institutions for not placing children such abuses will exist br br pick this one up it's worth the ride
<START> the production value of can be described by one adjective awful br br the script is ridiculous even in the fictional area of what are the good for on the ship why is the predator cleaning up all signs of his influence and than wasting precious time with and even presenting the body of an insignificant human cop why is the predator alone why is the predator himself only on earth but on his home planet why does the predator make his job so uneasy for himself by hunting down the aliens rather than bombing the whole countryside like the humans do in the end why is the predator dropping more more of his few weapons rather than collecting them to keep them together after using one in the end he is even dropping his armor before fighting the in hand to hand combat what a bad plagiarism of the first predators final fight between and the predator the gestures are so exaggerated that he is moving more like a japanese sumo than like highly skilled extraterrestrial safari hunter as one can see immediately the whole story is a mess but it gets even worse because this botched up job is filled up with boring patchwork of senseless interludes like a lengthy pizza ordering episode or some detailed information about the criminal past of the two brothers dallas ricky the sheriff is of course the friend of these two criminals who he puts regularly behind bars not convincing absolutely superfluous for the plot br br in addition to that the cast of actors is horrible compared to the high class of directors actors of the former aliens or predator movies is an embarrassingly bad piece of crap br br at last the action of the movie is really poor there is not a single scene of action combat in which the audience can see the whole set each and every fight is filmed in short shaky bursts with close up zoom at nearly full darkness that results in an atrocious experience for the audience because one can mostly see nothing but a dark shaky screen br br i suggest the two directing brothers to buy themselves a steadycam and get a lesson in modern cg so that the next film contains some visible action of visible figures and might not need to disguise their bad directing abilities in such a manner br br i would advise anybody even die hard fans against watching this film prefer the first one or the original aliens or the original predator films but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time on this failure
<START> this movie is pretty good as it is but the unreleased producer's cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original jamie's story is handled differently the death scenes are done 10 times better there's more footage of ritual type stuff giving more story about micheal jamie and her baby there is also an alternate ending which is also better why they didn't release this version instead i have no damned clue if you can find this version see it
<START> solo is a poor film that cannot be ignored the acting for the most part is very wooden the only exception is adrien brody's performance as solo's creator bill and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it whilst you where watching the film that said such films are more about the action than the plot acting and as such live or die by the action set pieces that after all is the point of such films to give 14 year olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance and even on this solo fails to deliver what little action there is is poorly done dull and uninspired after seeing the trailer for this on television i was hoping for something along the lines of predator with a robot replacing the instead i got a fairly lifeless action film with a poorly constructed attempt at depth by taking on message that robots can feel too watch terminator ii or predator instead both classics that this film desperately wants to be except it lacks the inspiration or to be fair the budget
<START> my god this is funny stuff yes it's puerile in the extreme but also rather witty here's the page with all the on it it's a little early for us i'm afraid well what are you doing up then and the fight sequences are second to none despite what you may have heard the laughs do keep coming and at a surprisingly generous rate the sheer comic abilities of and adrian help keep it riotously funny wringing every drop of comedy from the script i can only compare it to fear and loathing in las vegas you either find that film hysterical throughout or not at all the same applies here it's probably the funniest british film since withnail and i but to say it's an acquired taste is something of a gross sic understatement
<START> what can i say about the series dubbed the new outer limits hmm only that this was one of the best tv series ever assembled you have actors of all ages the actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot everyone playing their part to exact perfection these shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time if not all the time is very true you can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly not only do these shows have great story lines they also throw you into them get your mind racing and your blood pumping the original outer limits was a black and white in the 60's right these shows made a triumphant comeback the likes of which i have never seen the new twilight zone with forest whitaker was fun to watch but the new outer limits is where it's at if you have not seen i implore you to please check these episodes out and you will see exactly what i mean long live the new outer limits
<START> wow i swear this has never happened to me i only watched golden temple amazons yesterday and already i haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film that's how brilliant this movie is i guess by now i only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive dvd cover art showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target i often get fooled by appealing dvd covers Â especially jess franco ones Â and i still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences oh wellÂ after reading the other user comments some parts of my memory returned although i still suspect to confuse this film with another jess franco masterpiece i watched the day before namely diamonds of the and yes that one had an awesome dvd cover as well br br golden temple amazons opens with a posse of hot white african amazons Â i am aware of the contradiction but don't blame me Â slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple several years and hormonal changes later the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge she's accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldn't mind taking some gold back home the rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze eva and the other nameless amazons are all regular franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed you better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves as the rest of golden temple amazons is a boring and incompetent mess there's hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler bits and pieces of national geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff the awesome dvd cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection but opening the box is utter pointless
<START> this deceptively laid back low key casually paced aussie crime thriller unravels with a casual ease and relaxed self confidence that's a delight to behold eager beaver working class kid jimmy an appealingly feckless heath ledger yearns to make something out of his unrewarding ordinary life jimmy gets his big break when local crime kingpin an outstanding bryan brown assigns him an easy courier gig which entails delivering 10 grand to an old lady jimmy finds himself knee deep in serious trouble when he loses money writer director gregor jordan's engagingly simple tale of how things aren't always what they're cracked up to be young love all actions having consequences and that hoary old chestnut about how crime doesn't pay works like a charm thanks to a wonderful wealth of well observed minor quirky details a strong subtext concerning man's duel capacity for both good and evil a nice sense of unforced irony the chillingly matter of fact way the violence is presented and the marvelous grounding of the assorted drawn low life characters in an instantly recognizable and totally believable banal day to day reality e g panda is shown playing scrabble with a flunky and at one point interrupts a business conversation with a fellow hood to talk with his son over the phone judging from his finely shaded and two fisted portrayal of the cunning not to be trifled with bryan brown undoubtedly qualifies as one of the finest actors to ever grace celluloid a sturdy and satisfying little sleeper
