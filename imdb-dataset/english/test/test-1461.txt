<START> the film's subject is poignant and very real it happened one can debate some artistic liberties taken by director and scriptwriter the subject is what makes the film tick nothing else i saw the film for the first time after the real was gunned down in new delhi and had served several years as an elected member of parliament in india by the way she was not the first untouchable elected to parliament as some reviewers stated the so called untouchables have been elected to the indian parliament for decades in reserved br br while shekhar kapur as a director is a hero to many india because he made commercially accepted international films bandit queen and elizabeth and a tolerable kiddie movie called mister india which was accepted by the average indian audiences and even got oscar nominations for elizabeth i do not place him as a top notch film director from india he fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some above average performances from his actors subtlety finesse charm are not easy to find in his films melodrama brims in them br br his idea of using ali khan's vocal rendering of the song in the early parts of the film was perhaps his single major achievement on the undistinguished sound track of bandit queen and then perhaps the creaking doors during the gang rape sequence otherwise the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music one associates with them br br if you are looking for a good living indian film director who makes realistic cinema of international quality it is not shekhar movies you should see it is the later works of three indian film makers sen and girish and of course umrao jaan it is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that kapur had to give them and their films an international viewership for instance sen's katha made in telugu or ray's based on munshi prem are more complete as films to an intelligent viewer dealing on the state of the untouchables in india sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence but merely suggested them of course sen's nugget did not make headlines while effort them br br to credit he is articulate and used his limited talent and modest resources in the mumbai film industry to take his products beyond home audiences for that effort i salute kapur but bandit queen will remain a great subject awaiting an accomplished director to deal with it
<START> following the movie that represents the pinnacle of the 1980's ninja genre namely 'the revenge of the salivating fans were to this bizarre offering that mixes ninja shenanigans with spiritual possession the end result being not dissimilar in nature to that somewhat horrifying experience when one spies a nugget of human poop floating menacingly towards oneself in a public swimming pool br br take for instance the supposed 'action introduction which is set of all places on a golf course here we witness an evil green clad ninja slaying a group of golfers for apparently no discernible reason whatsoever although i must admit that the shallow elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport does irk me somewhat though hmmmm perhaps that's why he murdered them yep i can relate to that after all actually later in the movie we are told that one of the golfers was a top scientist but this story line is never elaborated upon nor alluded to ever again br br anyway back to the intro the police proceed to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the assassin and they have to keep on shooting him because he just won't stay down yes literally hundreds of rounds are pumped into him and still he gets up to slay of the law enforcement numbers br br finally after what seems like an eternity our miscreant detonates a smoke bomb and disappears or so it seems for in actual fact he is merely hiding beneath the soil and upon our decidedly gormless officers leaving the scene to search for his body he crawls out from hiding and staggers away br br we next see the lovely lucinda dickey a truly beautiful actress and in superbly fit physical condition here playing a telephone repair worker from her high vantage point she happens to spot the dying at last ninja however upon closer investigation the man supposedly on his last legs suddenly leaps upon her and grapples her to the ground after a bit of a struggle our feisty heroine manages to break free luckily but doesn't count on the ninja possessing hypnotic powers and she inevitably succumbs to them it is at this point that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine his intention is to use her corporeal form to slay those officers who killed him the few he didn't actually manage to wipe out initially br br from this point on throughout the film whenever our heroine spots one of the aforementioned officers she is subjected to some overwhelmingly awful cinematic scenes of flashing lights smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed unto her levitating towards her in a most wobbly manner br br to make matters more complex a particularly irritating police officer who sports enough back and shoulder hair to put an average yak to shame persists in trying to win her affections in a most bloody annoying manner well of course it doesn't take the gift of preconception to work out that in a rather feeble 'shock' less twist towards the end of the film he is revealed to be one of the officers she must slay br br but wait there's some hope yet br br step forward the one and only sho kosugi br br yes the ninja himself and looking here as cool as ever golf club news obviously travels fast and upon learning of the said events that transpired there he flies all the way from japan to sort the situation out suspecting the worst in a brief sub story that amounts to all of a few seconds sho's interest in this particular ninja is demonstrated to be personal after the said villain is shown to have murdered sho's father teacher and blinded one of sho's eyes thus necessitating sho to wear a really decorative looking sword guard eye patch br br after stealing his dead body from the morgue and then tracking down our heroine who provides an unwitting abode for the evil soul matters climax at an oriental temple seemingly in the middle of nowhere where our man sho manages to reunite the two disjointed aspects br br now reanimated from the dead the evil ninja and sho battle it out in traditional ninja style with swords with the winner being well yes you can probably guess br br really this movie has only two things going for it namely the always excellent kosugi who looks absolutely fantastic in the role as always and the lovely miss dickey what a shame that the material they found themselves in here is such a rancid pile of br br oh well to be fair i've seen a lot worse than this in my time although i certainly still can't recommend this other than to those desperate to complete their sho kosugi ninja movie collections
<START> it' s easier to watch this film if one views it as a scenario created by star fleet lieutenant reginald barclay during his holodeck addiction barclay is a recurring star trek character played by dwight schultz br br dwight schultz is miscast as oppenheimer character is poorly written so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge instead we see a shallow two dimensional figure from a soap opera paul newman is also miscast as general leslie but this movie's problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles br br the factual errors and great liberties taken with the chronology of events in order to advance screenwriter bruce robinson's political agenda make this movie embarrassing to watch that's probably why this movie has found a home on the so called history channel br br fat man and little boy combine bad science bad history bad screenwriting and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be viewed by impressionable high school or college students who know nothing about the manhattan project
<START> i wish i had read the comments on imdb before i saw this movie the first 1 hour was ok though it did make me wonder why everything was centered at chicago and why no one reported any weather anomaly from outside us isolated acts of nature of this magnitude are unthinkable but beyond the first 60 minutes the movie just drags on like a never ending story the screenplay is horrible as for the actors very poor choice only the people hired to run in panic stick to their roles but i do have to agree that this movie has got some good 'special effects' if you rented it on a dvd and would want to watch the movie despite the reviews then play it on maximum speed your player would allow
<START> mockumentaries are proliferating lately so much that the approach therefore needs an injection of fresh and creative material each time it's used to maintain its vitality this film does not deliver anything but worn out retreads of similar stories an aimless script weak ad libs uninspired acting and unfunny self gratifying humor br br the premise would seem promising enough the legend of the loch ness monster is made to order for one of these goofy mockumentary misadventures with a vast array of history and legend waiting to be tapped for outrageous satire the film makers totally waste this enormous potential however we get some fool inserting a fake into the water gee that's original another scene has one obnoxious idiot threatening another obnoxious idiot with a gun sidesplitting some gratuitous shots of a pretty girl in a bikini annette did that 40 years ago and far better by the way throughout the movie somebody always seems to be yelling i suppose this is designed to wake up the audience who have nodded off by this point br br worst of all though is the relentless salvo of those reality show type interview comments made by the characters not only do they nuke you with this tired joke every five seconds but apparently the actors also improvised that's the only explanation for how humorless the jokes are if lines like i've never seen anyone write a book about non evidence were actually scripted then the writer should be shot on sight and fed to br br no wonder got violent it obviously saw this movie
<START> i was 9 when i first saw this on tv on a friday night i remember the full page ad in the tv guide with the picture of the rex amazing how some things stick in your mind after 30 years anyway if your a kid who likes monster movies this one is entertaining enough especially with boone and keats raging at each other special effects are no harryhausen but its worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on late night tv haven't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics fade from cable tv if you do catch it on late night don't be too critical just grab some snacks and enjoy it it might be cheesy but i thought it was a lot better than the kong remake that came out in the theaters a year before
<START> i grabbed la because it reunited jean gabin and julien duvivier whose pepe le moko is a noir masterpiece i'll give it a few points because gabin is in it but the clumsy plot cheap sets and the ludicrous annabella making like an arab princess put the film on my to shelf if you watch it you'll find yourself asking why didn't the idiots build the fort around the well instead of a deadly few yards away from it and why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert but by then the sheer perversity of contrivance that makes up the script should numb you to any further contemplation
<START> i will be honest i rented this movie solely on the fact it was part of the child's play series i was expecting a boring dull 4th part too the series but i was surprised this movie was surprisingly good and i found it to be quite funny there was a lot of dark humor and the idea to have two dolls was a good way to spice things up the two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type fell to the movie overall it was very good for a 4th movie in the series with some gruesome death scenes just watch the marilyn manson type get killed at the beginning not to mention john ritter getting a face full of nails applauds to the writers for spicing things up and the ending although i found it a bit strange leaves room for yet another sequel maybe son of chucky
<START> following a roughly 7 year rocky road on nbc it was decided to do just one last super installment the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block buster of a tv hour it had always had a sizable hard core of hard corps of followers br br it was almost as if the series with the full title of homicide life on the street 1993 99 was a sort of mr in between of series it was too big to just cancel but too small to get a case of 'rabid ratings ravings' over br br during the precarious tenure on friday evenings they had presented some of the best and most daringly artistic of hourly dramas there i've said it artistic artistic but please remember we mean artistic but not just phony pretentious pedantic politically correct preaching br br when at last it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for homicide this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for tv movie br br looking at all the past seasons' happenings and parade of regular characters the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off br br our storyÂÂÂ as we join the story we find that baltimore homicide unit commanding officer lt al giardello has pulled the pin retired from the job that is but 'g' isn't ready to really retire retire yet so instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod we find that al is running for mayor of 'charm city ' br br while out in the city making some campaign stops and speeches the former detective lieutenant takes an assassin's bullet alive but in a comatose state he is taken to the hospital br br news spreads quickly and as if officially summoned we find all of the detectives of the baltimore unit we've seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance there is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead br br the producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story they managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones the whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way but at least for now we'll leave that as classified br br in wrapping up everything into a neat little package this tv movie surely gets our endorsement as for grading the homicide movie we must give it an a or a even but no matter the grade here it didn't score as high as a typical weekly episode
<START> this was just an awful movie i've watched it once when i was roughly 12 i am now 19 and i don't think i will ever forget this movie br br i still feel sick whenever i think about it it was just everything horrible that could possibly fit in one movie i really don't understand what kind of person would enjoy this utter rubbish it's not enough to simply turn off your mind to enjoy this movie i can enjoy the dumbest made for tv disney movies as much as the next person but this is something else completely br br usually i don't like to judge a movie until i have seen it myself but believe me i am doing you a favour do not watch this movie
<START> the merchant of venice was one of shakespeare's most popular plays during his own lifetime but it has fallen on hard times during the 20th century because of its undeniably anti semitic content the play has also been called schizoid in its careening from comedic scenes to tragic ones leading some to say it is two plays trying to coexist as one joseph fiennes who played william shakespeare in shakespeare in love is in love with lynn collins superb but needs to borrow a considerable sum of money to woo her he goes to his sometime gay lover antonio jeremy irons who hasn't the funds on his person but takes out a loan from the jewish usurer shylock al pacino shylock is amused and offended that antonio who insults him for his religion now comes to him for money but he offers it on the condition that the penalty for on the loan will be a pound of antonio's flesh which is of course what happens and offer shylock considerably more then the original loan instead of the pound of flesh but shylock distraught after his daughter leaves him and marries a christian refuses to take it in a scene where the audience is never quite sure where to place its sympathies deprives shylock of what should be legally his and then strips him of his wealth and religion shylock was originally essayed as a cartoonish villain but modern actors and directors have turned him into a tragic figure railing against the injustices of 16th century venice al pacino does an excellent job as shylock and jeremy irons is good as antonio but i think that lynn collins' work as is the best part of the play is one of the few notable female roles in shakespeare's canon and collins is wonderful in the part joseph fiennes is more than a bit dull however i've never particularly enjoyed his often overwrought acting style i give the merchant of venice an 8 10
<START> i watched this movie about six years ago and i recently did so again if i remember correctly i did not like it at all the first time and i appreciated it slightly more this second time br br this movie is obviously on a big budget the effects are mostly top notch except for one or two impacts and the cast is impressive however there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show br br firstly whoever decided that peter stormare should act as a crazy russian astronaut should be fired being a swede and a fan of peter i'm pretty sure he can play a russian character well but his performance in this case is plain stupid both with respect the lines uttered and the acting so something must be wrong with the script i'd like to see peter as a professional russian astronaut instead br br secondly the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is nearly unbearable to watch it is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch one's breath in addition to this the events that unfold are simply not credible i'd like to see a much more sensible and stripped down version of this part of the movie br br finally the scenes that involve flying space shuttles are too action biased the shuttles are maneuvering like if they were a couple of migs at zero safety distance while bouncing off car sized ice blocks like ping pong balls the director should watch apollo 13 to learn the limitations of spacecraft like these br br i like the music score because it is dramatic to a degree making it very touching the overall performance of the actors is great apart from the things mentioned above the story is interesting and quite easy to follow br br with some minor changes this would have been a 8 10 movie i'm sorry it isn't
<START> this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the cast is an international one australian pretending to be british stage american and a character with an english name sporting an unrecognizable european accent what passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity so short were the of this film's budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition in the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and slash thrillers of extraordinary though not necessarily high quality which have been made on no budget at all recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary blair witch project and of course the most recent that low budget winner saw featuring practically unknown leads gary elwes is just someone you don't remember even if you have seen him before in darkhunters it is shocking to find a known character actor dominique and hollywood has been jeff fahey struggling valiantly to save the film it is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man fahey in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines i would have rated this film 0 out of 10 had that been possible
<START> inferno starts off with a fairly impressive for a tvm effect we re also introduced to a scientist who s called heller don t you get it heller hell er inferno so i guess someone on the production had some intelligence however it does become more and more obvious as the tvm progresses that intelligence has been discarded throughout the storyline in order to appeal to an american tvm audience br br the story itself is overwhelmed by subplots featuring umpteen stock tvm characters like the tough liberal schoolteacher who s trying to save a home boy from a life of crime the doctor who s lost his medical licence etc in fact the story concentrates far more on these characters than the approaching disaster that all the potential tension and drama the scenario might have had soon goes up in a puff of smoke and being a tvm we just know that there won t be a downbeat ending br br there is an onscreen problem i noticed and that is everytime there s an explosion there s a massive fireball which looks ridiculous not to mention physically impossible look at the scene where the national guard are in a fight with a gang a soldier fires a grenade into a tower block and the whole building explodes in a fire ball what a small containing no more than a few ounces of high explosive can do that no it can t there s also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with plastic explosive and the same fireball effect is seen can directors please note that high explosive is not the same as napalm br br having said that i did find inferno highly watchable for a tvm and at no time did i find myself wanting to turn it off it did have some potential and let me repeat the special effects are fairly good considering the budget and it s not as bad a tvm as some people are making out
<START> this movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay at a house to get money by renovating it and then they find out that the house has a woman deamon in it and that there is a portal to hell in this movie there are heaps of stupid scenes like at the start of the movie how they are cleaning the house and they start to dancing to a cheesy song and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the professor gets his face ripped of i only hired this movie because i am a big fan of horror movies and its only worth watching if u are a fan of horror movies the acting in this movie is really bad the only good actor is roy scheider from the great movie jaws and over all this movie has heaps of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10
