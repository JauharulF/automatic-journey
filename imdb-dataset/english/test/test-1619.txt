<START> chan is in new york and he gets involved with an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design br br the war was over a year away from reaching america but the second world war was already raging everywhere else in the world and so it colored everything since most people probably realized that war was coming here the war isn't mentioned but the fact that the film deals with the production of planes at the very least alludes to it the mystery itself is pretty good it the notion of plane sabotage lends itself nicely to a couple of rather tense moments to be certain we are talking about charlie chan so we can be certain that he would live to fight another day but there was no guarantee what condition he would be in not whether anyone around him would survive br br i really like this film a great deal its not one of the nest and far from the worst it is one of the truly rare things a truly enjoyable one definitely worth a look or six
<START> i watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively anger in me to see the ruin of hanoi after the 12 day bombard and by living in the country right now with my parents who's been living in saigon for 50 years i understand that we're much better off now and would have been better if the american didn't bring war here watching the movie i learned more of the different kinds of wars that the america planned in vietnam and what disasters they caused br br the series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people but i don't like it that some people only give generic opinions like the analyst near the end of the series i forgot his name br br there should also be more documentary images like the life in the army camp of the south vietnam and those of the north if possible there's also a sudden change from the year of 1972 to 1975 i'm not sure if the in between was censored because i watched this series on tv
<START> from the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible hercules 1983 comes its even more preposterous read goofier sequel right off the bat we get another unwieldy beginning of time prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a superman like scrolling credits sequence narrative wise here we have four rebellious gods who steal seven all important but poorly animated Â a crime which for one thing sets the moon careening on a collision course with planet earth faster than you can say nepotism zeus once again played as a white haired bearded man by the relatively young claudio cassinelli sends his champion Â who has now rightfully taken his place among the elite thanks to one presumes the almighty tasks performed in the first film Â to find his blooming and avert the calamities in store br br no sooner has hercules lou ferrigno Â as if you didn't know touched the earthly surface that he comes in contact with two attractive damsels milly carlucci and sonia in need of his getting them out of distress the former who would go on to become an italian tv personality seemingly has the ability to talk with the little people Â which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from godzilla vs mothra 1964 just so they can swindle as much footage from the first film as is humanly possible the divine quartet of villains resurrect good ol' king william berger again from his skeletal slumber and pit him once more against his eternal enemy typically hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly foes including a gorgon Â an awfully underproduced sequence which ought to have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had the film makers behind the much superior clash of the titans 1981 bothered to watch this flick complete with the same reflection in a shield come uppance and preceded by the muscleman letting the audience in on his tactics before executing them as if to show us how clever he is and just to make it crystal clear that he wears his influences on his sleeve has hercules and turn into a cosmic version of king kong vs godzilla for one of their battles and later still king kong gets to grips with a large snake an encounter lifted straight out of the classic 1933 original i swear it this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth br br as had been the case with the first film the cast is full of old reliables like the afore mentioned berger cassinelli and venantino venantini as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day and up and coming starlets Â not just carlucci but also maria as a younger hera serena pamela and once again eva robbins whose costume here easily her appearance in the first film for what it's worth pino score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in his soundtrack for the previous film if you have stuck with this review so far you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence or spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws i'm sure i've left out some of its but i wouldn't forgive myself if i failed to mention the single greatest laugh out loud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair yes it even surpassed the afore mentioned animated titanic duel for me namely the dÃ©cor of the rebellious gods' lair which is in the shape of a giant br br at this stage one might well wonder why i gave this film and its predecessor a rating instead of a not entirely unjustified bomb in the past i've had various protracted online discussions on whether one's star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its sheer entertainment but these are two instances where i deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating i don't know maybe it's because i'm in a sword and sandal state of mind at the moment with some 10 more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days but after all uncharacteristically for me i decided to add these two films to my dvd collection simply based on the fun i had with them in this recent revisit Â and that alone must count for something no
<START> the seven ups seems like a replay of the french connection which was released two years prior both the late roy scheider and tony lo bianco make appearances as well as stunt driver bill hickman br br but we aren't dealing with french drug baddies instead we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum we get to see unpleasantness and a pre 1990s new york city br br i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action and it is a reminder of a cooler time that said when one compares the car chases mr hickman had involvement in the three most compared this movie bullitt and the french connection each chase scene has its own qualities and this one is simply superb br br and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd
<START> the director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle too bad the producers and writer director michael cimino spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the johnson county war was really about a lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing the cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep on the land to compete for on this cold windswept plateau the entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war br br the worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers the peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of indians would do in much earlier hollywood movies the true fact is that johnson county sheriff william red angus with a posse of 200 to 300 men intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the ta ranch i doubt any women took part in the siege br br ellen ella also known as cattle kate watson and her second husband james were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the johnson county invasion ella was never a prostitute this was a spread by the wyoming stock growers association in order to discredit her the fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the br br i object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction there is no fact in the events time lines or backgrounds of the characters why michael cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the johnson county war and events leading up to it is beyond me br br the movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the federal government intervention in a state government's affairs and what happened after the gunmen were saved by the calvary some effort was made to prosecute the cattlemen who were responsible by the johnson county attorney but since johnson county could not afford the court costs and the governor of wyoming amos w barber backed the the charges were eventually dropped br br overall i think the movie was just an excuse to show isabelle huppert naked for much of the three and 3 4 hours of running time on the dvd version
<START> the first 2 3 of this film wasn't that dissimilar to the american mummy films of the 30s and 40s two lovers in ancient mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die one became an aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love and the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her so far it's all the typical mummy film though it's quite a bit slower and duller than the american versions oh and of course the aztec mummy looked really really crappy br br however into this standard but boring film there is a super villain why i dunno it sure didn't make any sense to have one it seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the aztec treasure is buried why does he need the treasure well to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots dummy but first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy as the mummy has so far been unstoppable br br you've got to see these human robots as they look like the enormous clunky robots from flash gordon and other serials but they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside they really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie both battle in super slow motion like they are bathed in taffy and it's done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles certainly not thrills br br overall the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled mess especially at the end however for bad movie fans it's a must see it's bad but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh at with friends
<START> if you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining then you're bound to enjoy surveillance this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit the notion that this is a thriller is comical that would imply some kind of tension and twists you kept waiting for the story to actually finish starting it never rises above a glorification of weak minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life picture all of the violence of no country for old men without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters thrill killers run amok the acting is good mostly but the script is a pile don't bother and tell your friends to don't bother
<START> this movie features a pretty decent fx sequence of an earthquake for 1936 the reason you haven't seen it is because audiences in the 30s were enamored of the jeanette macdonald picture in which the eponymous star her way through countless songs while plots came to a complete standstill the fx cross time very well macdonald's songs do not and the awkward insertion of said songs to show off her only typical talent is not good br br the hoary device of two friends growing up to become a priest and a hoodlum is given another run through the machinery manhattan melodrama the departed at the 30 minute mark you've already heard the song francisco' three times entertainment in the thirties is generally an accumulation of irritation only grand hotel from the decade foregoes annoyance to the degree shown in san francisco dinner at 8 little caesar stagecoach all quiet on the western front les miserables etc
<START> naked city does a pretty good job of balancing its two a b stories eventhough i'm not all that fond of multiple plot movies and scott glen and courtney b vance make a great on screen dual however i'm not sure what kind of message a movie sends when two flat foot country girls can get off scott free with murder grand theft and to top it off win a free flight home in first class no less at least from the looks of their attire anyway gee i guess that blue wall of silence is still rather think br br rating 8
<START> meryl streep as kate a woman dying of cancer performs her role admirably no wonder she was up for an oscar in the part she proves that caring and nurturing housewives are just as important as their sisters out in the business world and the lesson she teaches about life's expectations and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows that is the most important thing she teaches her daughter we can expect too much of our mates realize that there are many slips and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life this is a sombre movie and the ending though sad shows reconciliation between the father and daughter i give this one a ten
<START> this movie was a modern day scarface it had me on my toes this movie is one of those rare epic films that makes you want a sequel i especially liked damian his performance deserved an academy award which he deserved for his performance in blood in blood out the only thing i didn't like was the behind the scenes because it didn't show the intensity that the movie had and i would have like to have seen less narrated scenes but the movie was great and it is in my top ten movies of all time plus the acting was great there wasn't a bad scene in the movie i loved it jennifer tilly was perfect as well as all of the cast i can't see how anyone wouldn't like this movie it was a great definitely a must see
<START> never having read or seen the bard's original work i can't begin to compare this work to his story so i won't instead i will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects and some that looked a little lower in budget but still decent enough to enjoy i thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing the style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing but i thought it was well done
<START> at first sight the bothersome man seems like several other movies books rolled into one kafka's the trial melville's bartleby the fall and rise of reginald and groundhog day instantly spring to mind a man andreas arrives in a nameless city where he is immediately given a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend however there's a catch his colleagues are all friendly bland and utterly characterless and everyone he knows including his girlfriend seems to have only one topic of conversation interior design welcome to the hell of modern consumerism in which people throw themselves from buildings and no one raises an eyebrow or spend their days reading furniture catalogues and eating food that tastes of nothing br br andreas quickly realises his predicament and spends the rest of the film trying to escape in various ways suicide turns out not to be an option and when he finds a new girlfriend she is just as bereft of feelings as the old one there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in with him and all she can say is 'i don't mind' br br in fact much of what the bothersome man has to say has been said before and after about 45 minutes you begin to feel that you indeed are experiencing a certain sense of deja vu yet its point is one that is probably worth repeating over and over again an unexamined life is one that is not worth living added to which it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls more than one character reminded me of people i've known especially his furniture obsessed girlfriend and if by the end of the film the film makers have run out of ideas maybe that's the point there will no end unless you can find other people who share your sense of alienation
<START> schieder delivers a semi believable part as the president of the united states with politically correct maria conchita alonzo as the female vice president the movie just stinks with so many plot holes its a wonder they got it to stick to the film it was shot on relegated to late night hbo time schedules this film is not worth seeing at all 10 minutes into it you are asking yourself why it was written 40 minutes into it you are wondering why you are watching it save the effort and watch a re run of hee haw or something anything is better than this clunker
<START> in a nutshell skip this movie it's that bad in short this movie is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are being developed because they make bad things they aren't popular so to speak a new female ceo comes in to clear things up and make sure the reputation of the company will be improved she does this by leaking company confidential information to the press do you believe this furthermore she starts to fire people she has never seen incredible uh a pacifistic group tries to destroy the company's mainframe because there are the blueprint located of those secret weapons this mainframe is located in the bottom of the building hidden in a kind of vault of course the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot which is the ultimate killer machine which resembles like an 'alien' from the alien movies the mad scientist likes the female ceo br br the mad scientist instructs the robot to kill everyone and so protects his job rise in chain of command and make the movie interesting the pacifists team up with the ceo and another person of the board of directors to escape from the robot further down the line they agree to blow up this evil computer mainframe whilst avoiding the robot they also discover that the factory was developing a part man part machine soldier they can erase a persons memory and replace it by a veteran soldier's one one of the pacifists is transformed in such a soldier and will hunt the killer robot i guess the mad scientist also wrote the script of this movie this super soldier looks and acts much the same as robocop though not as funny br br it boils down to this people are running being chased by a killer robot are hurt by it but they do not seem to troubled by that besides limping a bit and of course the female ceo is the leading character of this movie and cannot be killed i e survives every attack explosion you name it i won't bother you by the chase let's skip to the end they have lots of weapons yes the pacifist too and they know how to use them when they're at the roof of the building they empty all there weapons upon the killer robot they step into an elevator which is used to clean outside windows and then the female ceo knows some magic as well at the roof she was complaining about being out of bullets and like magic the gun is reloaded this way she can shoot the cables and let the elevator plummet 70 stories or so and let it stop right above ground surface by pulling the brake and to top it all off the police is waiting there for them the robot jumps after them and kills the cops hilarious no the robot chases them down the vault where the mainframe is and when finally the robot is so close to her that he can touch kill her it stops because the mad scientist did not want her to be killed a better name for this guy would be the idiot scientist although he is the one who made this movie watchable at this moment i was already pulling for the killer robot to finish them all of so the movie would end br br i cannot believe that this movie rates this high and this is why i wrote this comment avoid this movie like the plague it's a monster and i'm not talking about the death machine
