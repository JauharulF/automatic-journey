<START> the killing yard is a great film although uneven at times morris chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and jilted prison inmate and the presence of alan alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius the emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's flashback scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured i was not even born when the riot took place however through extensive research i find that the killing yard does the story all of it's fair i would definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educational or activist group as a much needed learning tool
<START> a coming of age story about a teenager rebelling against the church and her minister father in a small norwegian village the countryside setting is picturesque but the story is rather pretentious and plodding with much of the film devoted to quoting scriptures it's like watching a religious propaganda movie who has made only one other movie is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist as are as her strict father and as a woman that is fascinated with the film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired director and co writer who has worked mostly in tv is not up to the task
<START> minor spoilers br br need any further proof that tsai ming liang ranks among the most original and provocative filmmakers working anywhere today see this film br br working from slight variations of a theme running through most of his work the hole represents a study in alienation and loneliness in this case between a man and woman who are upstairs downstairs neighbors and how varied structures real or psychological of modernity wall people off from one another here the woman the downstairs neighbor attempts to endure as her apartment is flooded by a prodigious leak from upstairs a plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor already isolated and desperate both characters are among the few residents of a housing project who haven't fled in advance of a mysterious near apocalyptic epidemic the hole linking the two apartments functions first as yet another in a long line of indignities but soon begins to take on a significance of near mythic proportions br br tsai's sense of humor and sense of cinematic history is displayed with a bit more than usual as the woman's occasional daydreams revolving around her upstairs neighbor are visualized as musical numbers set to the music of grace chang which explode from the screen in brief bits of surreal romance and humor quite reminiscent of the big screen pennies from heaven and for all of the ennui and alienation on display here tsai's skewering of late 90s pre millennial tensions is funny absurd and gives this film a very appealing the final scene is extraordinary br br meanwhile tsai in typical fashion subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions westerners bring to asian cinema with a nonchalant casually revealed directness focusing on both the absurdist tendencies of the human mind and the most absolute of there's an utter nonchalant of almost everything about his characters backstory or most cultural signifiers which does amplify the isolation of the characters making the hole and his other films rather disorienting but also always fascinating and insightful
<START> o m g did you ever think they would make a movie about it well i knew they would but i didn't know when and now its here at last when i received it yesterday through the post i put it into my wicked stereo that plays dvds and instantly had this grin on my face as cloud appeared looking well gorgeous and they followed by all the other fascinating characters from final fantasy the game including and my favourites they are pretty too in this the graphics knocked me out they were truly amazing so real down to the last hair the story line is ok bit confusing especially as my version of the film was in japanese but of course being a long time final fantasy fanatic i did not mind a bit i just read the subtitles all the characters talk the way they would do in the game and reno and rude are still ridiculous the dragon scene is wicked too just looks so good anyway the graphics were amazing the storyline fantastic and the basic idea of even having a film genius
<START> though this film destroyed director and screenwriter michael cimino's career and bankrupted united artists it still stands as one of the top movies of all time there are plenty of reasons to prematurely dismiss this movie for sure among them its length its technical problems its colossal mistreatment of animals on set the list goes on and on and yet for all of this it remains a film that captures something it is a classic example of naturalistic storytelling on par with strindberg its moments lasting as long as they might in reality having not been dumbed down for good cinematic timing it feels real in its moments of anger love and war and hopelessness this film should be seen by any person who appreciates film and storytelling
<START> wow i truly regret watching this picture funny i agreed to see it just for my wife who endured the torture of seeing it about a half an hour before retiring while i stayed in front of the tv but only to feed the the masochistic in me and i because i wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some redeemable aspects which might alleviate the feeling i had of being a stupid for watching this called two girls and a guy br br everything in this picture is wrong totally wrong since the initial absurd premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend until the awful but merciful end not forgetting the horrible acting of the three actors don't believe the rumors the acting is bad and i don't see how graham has made herself a known name within the movie industry br br i wonder why after the producers saved some bucks with just three actors and an only location they didn't hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his br br at least i felt a little fine when i destroyed the dvd and threw it to the trash anyway i liked somehow and just a little the brunette actress natasha something but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of face off changing faces so two girls and a guy to the bottom goes br br stay away from this
<START> heard some good remarks about this film as being very gory and but it's neither obviously the screenwriter wanted to do a scary horror film but at the same time inject some teenage comedy for the young target audience scares and comedy seldomly result in good films the same goes for monster man br br not really funny nor scary or overly enjoyable on any other level br br 39 years of age i've seen my share of horror movies i have seen good ones and terrible ones but the crop of films released these days are so frighteningly mediocre it bores me to watch 'em the acceptance these days for bad films like this is what really annoys me let's face it they produced a lot of crap in the 70's 80's and 90's but they were regarded as such then as well today they're regarded as good entertainment bollocks
<START> this film is a cash in a cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic yul brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values lee van cleef takes over the lead role of chris i can't think of any actor who looks less like brynner than van cleef hey he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache just for the sake of continuity some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders one step out of line and the magnificent seven ride is brought to the fore and wielded they didn't even bother trying to make this movie not look like a tv movie abysmal
<START> they used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the of men the funny thing is you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background br br ok the plot some lady says there should be a society with no men and the crowd in front of her which contains some men think its a great idea so then all the men are killed or something so there are no more br br then this blonde scientist creates a man but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent the male grows very quickly and soon is a full grown man not long after he takes the volkswagen beetle and drives into the city where he's discovered now you would think the lone man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever but no way the police chase him br br i didn't watch the rest but it probably ends up that they've got to race against the clock and some people or something bad will probably happen somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to lead the rebellion these brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan which laid out the details of how they'd single handedly get rid of a planet full of women but i didn't watch and neither should you br br if you're up late and channel surfing and this happens to come on don't watch watch anything but this you'll find those ads for or the ones with women in bathing suits asking you to up the phone to meet women just like in your area will be more satisfying entertainment br br oh yeah there's this funny thing when they're pulling in with their cars i don't know what they did it looks like they drove in real slow and careful but then tried to speed up the film to compensate but it just looks really weird br br the blonde girl was kind of cute and i'm feeling generous so 2 10
<START> i've watched a lot of television in my 51 years but i've never had so much fun week after week as i had watching oz the acting by the entire cast was excellent the writing was just perfect with every character remaining consistent throughout the six year run i also enjoyed the mayhem and the ultra violence it may sound odd but it was at times comical finding out how one of the characters would eventually end up dead i particularly enjoyed the true romance and love between and keller those two men really knew how to throw down in every way possible i truly hope that hbo will continue to show us re runs of this great show forever i've watched every episode at least 4 times yet i still look forward to tuesday and thursday nights at 11 p m for an episode of this fun and very entertaining show
<START> i have read all of shakespeare's plays seen productions of a majority of them and even acted in and directed some i do not necessarily believe that shakespeare must be done in the traditional fashion but i hated this movie br br there is nudity that is gratuitous and unnecessary there is that is far beyond what i believe shakespeare intended some of the dialogue is incomprehensible and there are those elements like the singing and dancing that add no meaning to the movie but replace shakespeare with the director's self indulgences br br i am sorry to say that i wasted perfectly good money to buy the dvd of this movie
<START> i'm not surprised that this film did well at the hamptons film festival it is a shallow film that would appeal well to shallow people two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and look for a lost dog the film is allegedly exploring the dynamics of the relationship however the relationship is far too petty to merit any such exploration this couple has one dimension they fight they tease then they make love and fight some more there brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with each other given their venomous and volatile relationship beautifully shot excellent score but without anything of merit in the script or characters this short is just that
<START> well this movie actually did have one redeeming quality it made up the funniest season one episode of mst3k i wish rhino had released this one instead of the crawling hand
<START> five characters in search of an exit has to be one of the most boring zones ever made it was on sci fi this morning and as usual i changed the channel i put it in my top five list of the worst zones ever produced dull and predictable and not worth watching serling worked this theme to death earthlings in the hands of aliens who often were giants and in this particular version it just doesn't work anyone who hasn't seen it before will quickly figure it out this is another serling philosophical mood piece perhaps paralleling the plight of those in prisoner of war or concentration camps where the imprisoned may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their captors william windom as the soldier who is the last to drop in is the only one curious to make the effort and it doesn't take long to figure the outcome
<START> as this movie unfolds you start to feel the conundrum of human existence if you carry with you questions inner wars unsolved puzzles about the meaning of life then you will feel this movie with every morsel of your body charles darwin begins a war with an utterly predictable ending war with god his theories resemble the fact that god has nothing to do with mankind has nothing to do with the amazing world that we live in savage harsh ironic and chaotic this words surround the mind of the character thrown into an universe of material truth who slowly pushes hope for god out from his mind nevertheless the movie as charles darwin still sees wonder and beauty beyond god in the universe of infinite evolution
