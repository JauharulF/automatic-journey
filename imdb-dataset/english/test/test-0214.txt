<START> few videos in recent history have been as amateurishly produced as this one at least none that have been released by such a reputable distributor every frame of this film is a of better films of the past the word is given new meaning by a talentless writer director who should reserve his imagination for lesser masturbatory efforts that don't victimize film viewers assisting in the amateur night 'horror' effort is a number of less than capable technicians who contribute poor cinematography and laughable make up and special effects unfortunately the one or two of the amateur actors in the film who display a hint of talent that will go unnoticed due to the reputation that this atrocity will produce
<START> this 2 5 hour diluted snore fest appears to be one of the poorest excuses for an adaptation ever clearly possessing a budget allowing for breathtaking location shooting in greece the monies might have been better spent working out a cohesive script with character development and motivations clearly outlined especially since bill has gone through the trouble of doing this already the portrayals lacked passion direction leaving the viewer debating whether they should bother to care about the demise of the protagonists at all which brings out another point the main character of the original work prospero is not so named in this rendition despite the fact that most other characters' names are used enchantment and magic are also markedly absent from this particular piece in fact all aspects that made the stage version of 'the tempest' full of wonder and intrigue have been sucked completely from this convoluted version about a self absorbed pompous arse who can't figure out how to care about anything beyond the blur of his wealth and power over all a lackluster effort at best and a brutally poor imitation of the intended inspiration
<START> i have seen this movie and i did not care for this movie anyhow i would not think about going to paris because i do not like this country and its national capital i do not like to learn french anyhow because i do not understand their language why would i go to france when i rather go to germany or the united kingdom germany and the united kingdom are the nations i tolerate apparently the olsen twins do not understand the french language just like me therefore i will not bother the france trip no matter what i might as well stick to the united kingdom and meet single women and play video games if there is a video arcade that is all
<START> if you like detective and police shows and you like suspenseful movies then you will love this movie this movie is great christopher meloni has amazing acting skills you may think you know who the killer is in the beginning but you don't this movie is about the true story of the murder of martha watch the movie
<START> the mere presence of sam waterston as an indian is enough to put this movie in the must see category he is both beautiful and very subtle with no lines whatsoever he is tender with his and yet we can see he is among the proudest of all young indian men martin sheen is just a dumb who decides to challenge waterston white bull for a gorgeous white horse other sub plots are really unnecessary i don't understand the part played by caroline langrishe as the poor girl who white bull kidnaps i don't know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful indian man it's a lot of fun though especially if you're a waterston fan man he looks good in this one harvey keitel's role isn't even worth mentioning to tell the truth but rent it and enjoy actually i do believe that if the music score was better it would've been a more dramatic film the music is so bad it's distracting still there's mr waterston
<START> some people go down in a cave for some reason and there's some sort of creature that's killing them br br i usually give a more detailed plot but i wasn't paying too much attention to this overall it was dull and the only time you'll be really paying attention is during the action scenes which the director did wonderful on br br the acting is alright but the characters are so dull and forgettable they blend in your mind you'll forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons 1 the kills are boring 2 the characters are boring br br the ending might have shocked me more if i knew who was who br br so you're looking for a creatures in cave movie check out the descent instead
<START> and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice bouncy jugs running around the so called african jungle so no problems there for most males out there br br i watched it as one of those bundled together package forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible just to give you a sense our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles again no complaints br br the fight scenes are laughable and borderline on the pornographic our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie on occasions when she has to fight the fighting involves rolling around in the dirt grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens i am surprised no hair pulling is involved it get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the combatants that i said the one that draw first blood wins in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting br br the witch doctor was a bloody blast from being a big cuddly bear in the beginning he became manic depressive when captured and then outright psycho he spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance br br beside our heroine bouncing around topless you also get to see plenty of other amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons yeah it is that kind of movie br br watch the beautiful in her bouncy glory despite the movie being more than 20 years old the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old
<START> as a czech i am very pleased when i read these comments here i am absolutely sure that this film is great and what you maybe don't know is that story was specially written for mr the man you can see is him and his typical attitude to live and to resist death he was one of great actors and we are very lucky that we he has made so many beautiful films during his life you are lucky you could see at least one of them enjoy
<START> this movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved it's always interesting to see the story from the 'other' side for a change this movie concentrates on a group of german soldiers who after fighting in the north africa campaign are send to stalingrad russia where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of ww ii is being fought br br it's interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the germans simply as the in this movie those are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you're fighting against at first it's kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the are the evil villains but of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in them br br the way this story is told isn't however the best it's hard to keep track of the story at times as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other the movie isn't always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who it doesn't always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around in that regard hollywood movies are always better than european movies br br the production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations though the movie wasn't even shot in russia itself it helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere br br the character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic but i don't know for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism it also helps that they're being played by well cast actors all of the actors aren't the best known actors around thomas kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality br br all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth a look due to its original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and its good production values br br 7 10
<START> an inspired choice of director for this latest brit flick rose who burst on the scene with the budget free tale of ny dykes go fish brings a gently jaundiced view to this tale of a londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths the highlight for me is a scene where the society try to revert to being primitive hunter gatherers but end up ordering a take away the film as a whole is wonderfully acted and who'd never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film relishes the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with go fish 's grainy a really enjoyable film
<START> hmmmm i'm kinda at a loss here i mean i know i liked death bed i know i'll be spreading the gospel of death bed to all my friends and acquaintances and if you're reading this i urge you to see death bed but i can't really say why perhaps that's the secret of its charm br br plot well sort of there's this bed that eats people and fried chicken apples flowers suitcases and any other darn thing that gets near it by sucking them inside its digestive fluid filled mattress amongst its near limitless powers bed has the ability to keep the spirit of aubrey beardsley trapped behind a picture to observe and narrate the events of the film various people then wind up at abandoned mansion habit of eating anything that moves gave the place an unsavory reputation and lay down to have sex or take a nap or because they don't feel well and get eaten sometimes having trippy dreams first and in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between beardsley mom you had to be there and bed br br seems rather straightforward when i put it like that doesn't it well except for the aubrey beardsley part but something feels constantly off kilter and the story seems to glide from one scene to the next even when indulging in cheap laughs or strange gore effects imagine crossed with bergman then left to soak in a big vat of herschell gordon lewis the tone of the story shifts from horror to fairy tale to comedy to existential meditation without breaking stride an incredible achievement for a no budget student film shot in the detroit area br br all in all an astounding little film that quite probably no review can ever completely do justice see it for yourself
<START> i was unfortunate enough to see this movie at a friends' house what an utter waste of time what an utter and complete piece of crap this movie is absolutely nothing is funny in it from the shower scene to the insulting and degrading portrayal of germans there is no plot the acting made me gag and at the end i personally wanted to beat john leguizamo with a stick i thought john woo movies were bad this movie is officially the worst movie that i have ever seen
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen and believe me i've sen a lot of bad movies i love horror but this was just terrible there was not one scene in this film where i felt scared all the actors must have been people that they found at a bus stop 20 minutes prior to shooting i wish that would have given me my 99 cents back the acting was terrible the writing was incredibly bad someone had to screen this movie before it was released and had to know that it was terrible i'd be embarrassed to have my name associated with this monstrosity don't rent this movie if you do don't return it so no other poor souls will ever make the mistake of renting it
<START> i first saw this film by chance when i was visiting my uncle in arizona about 3 and 1 2 years ago the vhs print was a little faded looking but i was very haunted by what i had watched did it all make sense well honestly no it didn't however this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects the beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression br br well when i found out that anchor bay had released this oddity on dvd i picked it up immediately i was very pleased by the transfer though i felt the extras rather lacking though the film concerns the o and sir stephen characters it really has nothing to do with pauline original novel or the 1974 film the story of o however the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystic kind o decides to prostitute herself for sir stephen in violent 1920s hong kong her mission is to prove her unending devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men naturally sir stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds himself a mistress however the tables are turned when o actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer suddenly sir stephen feels the threat br br i feel that the deep meaning behind the film including the tragic score and artistic direction really make this film a classic the viewer is introduced not only to the lives and pasts of o 's fellow brothel mates but the turmoil of 1920s hong kong is also explored like the political setting the prostitutes all find themselves in need of belonging no one is happy in the film even if they believe that they are however o does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer one prostitute tearfully remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress she cannot let that vision go she treats her clients as co stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river br br as for o she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle when he leaves she feels a sense of abandonment of course in that same flashback kinski suddenly becomes her father i was very very disturbed by this image i truly felt for o at this point in the film she hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees sir stephen as her father and caters to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love br br another curious aspect of the film is the young child that ages at the end that sells fortune in a box it is a very random character but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film at one point the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people now if that isn't symbolism for you laugh br br all in all i really love this film i feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience it has erotic scenes but the scenes aren't really meant to arouse like the lives of the characters the sex acts are empty they are motions but lack feeling and tenderness once again the only tender scene is between o and the young man o believes she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor however she finds in the end that she has choices she too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness however she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew the director leaves a lot of unanswered questions however some things don't need answers the viewer will make the judgment that works for them br br i must say that i wish a special edition of this dvd would be released that had director commentary i think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later it is a shame that the soundtrack was never released this film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score there is something about the lingering vocals that send a chill up my spine i can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music
<START> it took me a few years to hunt down this title a major staple of my childhood almost every trip to the video shop i'd pick out space raiders and watch it three times every time my mother rented it for me it was i suppose my star wars br br it's a shame then that it's such a stinker my memories were so hazy that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia so i had to take it at face value a crew of space pirates accidentally kidnap a pretty annoying little kid and spend the rest of the movie trying to get him home br br aimed squarely at the under tens it's got unwelcome slapstick very shoddy costumes and make up recycled special effects wobbly sets and poor acting but even with the unintentional comedy it's no fun to see it as an adult where i can pick out not just the technical faults but wonder at how spectacularly the writer and director managed to botch an endless stream of no brainer fun powerful moments that have been seen in a million other sci fi movies and in the hands of anyone remotely competent should have been successful br br i imagine as a kid i probably found it quite empowering there are lots of i can't do this i'm just a kid sure you can you just have to try type exchanges the kid drinks beer etc but even by low budget 1983 sci fi standards this one's pretty awful with a real snoozer of a finale
