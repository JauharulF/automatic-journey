<START> this was not a very good movie the acting pretty much stunk and the effects were bad most of the time but there were some funny moments but most of those were not meant to be funny the most hilarious part of the movie to me was the part were a little kid in wheelchair falls out thats not the funny part what kind of person do you think i am anyway the kid falls out and starts screaming for his big brother well the brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny he's all stumbling and really over acting i had to rewind it several times so i could laugh some more so if your looking for something to rent but just can't seem to find anything check this one out and watch for the running part
<START> seriously if i wanted to make a movie that makes zero sense never will and features lesbian scenes as its only high point i could have br br david lynch is the worst as is this movie anyone could have made a better movie in which at least some answers were given and the story wasn't so slow and long winded the story means nothing without something at the end besides the credits what a waste of time i will never get those 147 minutes of my life back and hope that others can learn from my mistake
<START> there's not that much to say in the end one would have expect much more from a director who made way better movies in the past it just seems like he did it without actually caring the actors are doing their job though belmondo is far from amazing but you just don't get hooked in a word it's boring this is even more disappointing since i heard several time that this movie could be considered as a reaction to all the big american blockbusters which are considered to be a threaten to the french exception by those who just can't admit they should turn to another job i tell you if that's the best reaction we're supposed to get boy i'm going to be really depressed soon
<START> it's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film men are lecherous chain smoking with one thing on their minds time hasn't changed men all that much but sexual harassment has women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband settle down some of the dialog is cringe worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent passÃ© way i love the opening credits that show a romantic exciting view of manhattan with johnny mathis singing the best of everything on the soundtrack i want to jump right into some scenes filmed on n y streets circa 1959 experience a time i've only seen on film in photographs some scenes in this movie reminded me of melanie griffith's working girl especially when hope lange who's a cross between grace kelly dolores hart gets bombed in handsome stephen boyd's apartment he her in just watches her sleep like melanie she wants to know if anything happened between them the following day joan crawford is definitely comparable to sigourney weaver's horrible female boss except she was outwardly nasty with a soft core but character was sweet on the outside horrible on the inside i found it distressing how the suzy parker character gregg started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress who supposedly didn't need a man to complete her ended up she becomes a stalker lunatic nut job when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her bananas after he's done with her i loved the character mary agnes the office gossip with her thick new yawk accent if you enjoy films like valley of the dolls you'll like this one too
<START> i'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book given the number of characters and subplots during katyn i thought that the movie creators perhaps the writer or director intended to create an epic movie but really there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story aggravatingly there were many unrelated side stories that could have been edited out br br in relating the events leading up to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers i don't think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary was it political philosophical revenge the interesting part of historical movies are seeing personal motivations or emotions instead the murderers of katyn seemed like automatons controlled entirely by stalin who's appears occasionally framed as a charcoal sketch the portrayal of the russians and germans seemed entirely one dimensional are polish people just that angry at the russians besides being badly edited and biased or at least unrealistic choices of music and cinematography felt mismatched to each other and to the movie itself i don't think you can really shoot an epic war film or war event on hand held camera but if the director went with a character driven story perhaps by focusing on a single family maybe the handy cam approach would have worked better and if you use really dramatic music it needs to be better balanced to the type of shots made
<START> i had a hard time sitting through this every single twist and turn is predictable you're sitting there just waiting for it waiting for it and yes there it is just as you predicted at the very beginning of the movie or 10 minutes out et cetera br br smart writing no br br torture porn no there's no nudity other reviews calling this torture porn are most likely written by people on heavy drugs unfortunately there's no torture and no nudity yes no nudity br br there's no suspense at all in this thriller the only good part about this movie is the ending but i'm not going to spoil that br br i'm giving it a 2 10 a 1 10 would be a horrible b movie this movie had better acting
<START> rarely will anyone deny that hitchcock remains one of the most creative inventive and prolific directors of all time because he is arguably all of these things it takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties saboteur however is not creative or prolific at all rather hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster american pride a certain call to arms support our troops title which was a popular theme of the time with that in mind hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film including but not limited to a logical plot characterization believable dialog and a fluent running storyline br br typically hitchcock does great with espionage films only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with the foreign and the 39 steps but seemingly lost his stride in creating saboteur and merely recycled the same once thrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems br br 1 despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across america the only person who recognizes kane is blind br br 2 at the dinner party kane and patricia don't want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were gate crashers logically what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening besides does anyone need to be reminded kane is a wanted terrorist br br 3 since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs br br 4 nobody recognizes him his face is on every newspaper br br 5 the spies catch up with kane in the ghost town and assume he's the man freeman sent to work with them he have some sort of credentials i know spies don't run around with name tags and photo ids but a secret handshake maybe br br 6 cop picks up kane escaping from freeman's house still seems no one recognizes this guy br br 7 how exactly does the fbi come to believe kane with no evidence they don't even show kane talking to the fbi the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher br br 8 when the cops search the carnival caravan how do they know kane is now with a woman the blind man believed kane's story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing kidnapped or even more importantly running with kane why does this movie not employ logic br br this is a running list the movie is not exciting the plot makes no sense and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing hitchcock fails miserably on this one
<START> love this little film that reminds me somewhat of the original japanese gem shall we dance not the overblown gere jlo remake luckily i found it and taped it when it was showing on a starz promo weekend because as far as i know it's not available on dvd i'll watch just about anything with yancy butler anyone remember the short lived tv series mann and machine in it and she positively shines in this she does a dance routine to a disco song that is hot loved all the other characters in it especially the ones played by patrick stewart and leslie caron where's she been all these years this is one of those films that i take out from time to time and always come away smiling after watching it recommended highly
<START> i have now seen the whole of season one and can say i have not enjoyed a show of this standard in a long time it great to see a show like this in the pipeline and hope that there are many on the way the season final was the best bar none cant wait for season 2 as far as i am things can only get better like how will to change will rick get his family back and how will they get off the church roof with acting of this level it is easy to see why the show is such a big hit with people as long as people as making shows like this i will keep watching i think its hard now to come up with an original idea as so many shows have a large range of subjects so to see one as original as this is refreshing
<START> pretty disappointing i was expecting more of a horror thriller but this seemed to be more of an episode of dawson's creek but with out the acting there were some very impressive shots though almost worth seeing maybe future efforts will improve
<START> altman's quintet has to be considered more than just flawed as so many other reviewers have pointed out the ideas behind the film even some of the choices in depicting those ideas ought to work and yet very little in this difficult film does the partially fogged camera lens i remarked to my wife that it has to be the most distracting directorial conceit i've ever seen never allowed me to get into the film's world br br in general there are serious problems with the mise en scene employed here it's clear that no small amount of thought went into factors like costume and production design but neither is very effective in evoking a believable world perhaps it is a matter of scale the film is so stage bound that i laughed out loud once it was mentioned that five million people lived in the city yes i understand the constraints of the film's budget matte paintings here and there might have helped in all the most disappointing altman film i've ever seen great ideas and grand metaphors do not always come through in art it's just part of the game
<START> if love me tonight is the musical for people who don't like musicals it has to be said that the gay desperado is definitely not a musical for people who don't like opera in fact despite apparently being based on a comic operetta it is not really a musical at all but a spoof bandit story with interpolated unrelated arias to show off the voice of one character and what a voice it is br br nino martini as the young singer chivo who joins the bandit troop to get a spot on the radio no the plot doesn't make a lot more sense later on either has a glorious golden tenor whose style hasn't dated a day since the era when it was recorded the and of some of his musical contemporaries belong to a bygone fashion but it's very easy to picture chivo belting out nessun dorma to a world cup crowd and topping the charts in the process unfortunately while he has an engaging grin and a decent dramatic range he is completely incapable of acting and singing at the same time the result is that the otherwise rapid paced film grinds to a shuddering halt every time chivo lays his hand on his breast and starts to declaim and the viewer's tolerance of the result is likely to depend on his appreciation of operatic performance br br aside from this drawback the film is an enjoyable broad brush satire on hollywood conventions and the mexican bandit stereotype in particular which achieves the vital goal of all such spoofs in making its characters engaging enough in their own right to hold the viewer's interest when the joke would otherwise have grown stale the bandit chief and his sidekick have the traditional double act relationship there is an enigmatic with a carved teak face and a spirited heroine a young ida lupino who performs the generic you say you hate me but you love me really routine with a refreshing twist br br overall the film is entertaining and pretty funny and i feel i did get my money's worth but it can't be denied that the musical interludes while admirable in their own way introduce severe pacing problems
<START> this must be the worst thriller i have seen in a long long time the directing the acting and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot into a meaningless waste of time within a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very early on leaving no mystery i guessed this within the first few minutes and i kept hoping i was wrong and much to my dismay i was not br br the film starts off with two fbi agents who drive to a remote town to investigate a murderous spree which has left three witnesses a young girl a drug addict and a cop they are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each tells their account of the day each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts this part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this film better br br spoiler the whole story ends in the fbi agents being the actual killers and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and so left unhurt by them br br why do they go through the whole charade of interviewing three witnesses and bonding with the young girl if their idea had been to kill them in the first place how did they get away with pretending to be fbi agents when you discover that real fbi agents had been killed and their badges were found on them how did they know how to set up and use the surveillance cameras br br bill pullman and julia ormond are so unconvincing from the beginning to the end maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end come on they both look ridiculous stupid and not sinister in the least the character of the young girl is also wasted potential there is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bond with in her ordeal she does not appear distressed but rather detached which again is not explained br br awful film on the whole
<START> what a bloody nuisance you can't get on subjects like these with tv budgets and some director who can't tell the difference between a i ii and iii all the silly clichÃ©s are well in place on the character and human level the story is so schmaltzy and unbelievable it hurts and all those responsible get carried away with joy for the brilliant ratings tech details rubbish flying that close would have kicked each other out of the sky by the dozen single night fighters attacking line ridiculous as i said made up by a director who i bet never even heard the name lancaster before that project and some kid 3d guys who turned into waddling ducks but these are minor things compared to the overall mediocrity of this film although it might be too harsh i dare say this hurts the memory of those who died on both sides tv crap entertaining the dumb masses who don't care anyway shame on those responsible use your brains next time and enjoy the profit you made from it
<START> there are 3 of these movies all similarly crafted and each extremely amusing red plays radio sleuth wally benton aka the fox who gets wrangled into solving real life crimes along with his fiance played by your typical wartime girl next door looker ann rutherford many of the one liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s which i anticipated but just as many actually made me laugh out loud which was unexpected to say the least red skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence surprising i say because i grew up with a much older version of the man who's charm really didnt play well in my formidable years i have to give these movies the go ahead though if your in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare i almost threw in light hearted but in truth people get wasted and beaten up and dare i say it the suspense at times is well above average as with most movies from this era it gets a pi politically incorrect rating for reasons you can well imagine wartime is funny that way i guess and so then again are these movies watch one watch them all
