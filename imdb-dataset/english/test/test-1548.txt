<START> think of an extremely low rent version of heathers and you've got pep squad that sums up the flick in a nutshell i must give credit where credit's due though the film has a nice visual appeal to it i liked the cinematography i liked the wild color schemes i liked the costume designs but without good acting a film has no redeeming value i'd rather watch a film with little visual appeal with good actors and sharp dialogue i e the brothers or any edward burns film the actors either recite their dialogue in or scream it out like they're in a bad soap opera this is why i don't badmouth most mainstream actors let's face it most actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason if they're not great actors they're at least competent people badmouth leo dicaprio but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites the dialogue as if he's reading it off the page it's a shame because the director seems like he knows his stuff when it comes to mis en scene sp at the same time i can't totally praise steve the director he did write the screenplay which contains some horrible dialogue he might be slightly racist too since there's a black principal in the movie who inhabits a culmination of african american stereotypes
<START> i'm seeing a pattern here if you see a movie on mystery science theater 3000 chances are if you go to imdb com there will be hordes of lovers of the film yet it was picked to be on that tv show because it was sooo bad i'm sorry but i read a lot about x m as being some landmark sci fi film that stressed realism well if that is the case i could write for several paragraphs about how even with 1950's knowledge this movie is utterly flawed gravity might be the first obvious observation or as mst3k did as a skit selective gravity also what about when they are plunging to their death and they are just standing there looking out of the window um would'nt the ship being upside down effect that scene i would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over budget or something but i think this movie was just plain cheese as in the from under type just compare this to when worlds collide which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this movie ranks there's no comparison the movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own its not even funny to watch on its own it gets about a 5 or 6 as a mst3k episode as there is no action or much to make fun of just bad bad bad oh did i mention it's bad
<START> i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2 i gave it an extra star just because david keith's gun was cool
<START> the headline describes it exactly this dribble of a film was nothing more than the typical 'group of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is haunting killing them off 20 years later' crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades the only twist is instead of an angry ex classmate or lovable psycho loser it was a nun nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls blah blah girls accidentally purposely drown the nun blah blah nun haunts the girls people die movie ends the only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes which were pretty cool especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat lady's arms but even they couldn't make this a great movie brian yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this refuse i'm sure glad i rented it and didn't buy it or i'd be furious beyond belief if you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses go watch or something stay away from this garbage
<START> like a lot of movies involving little kids this starts off real cute and likable and then after about a half hour or so becomes the reverse br br that's certainly the case here in this time travel story which i usually love where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight great premise and a great lead actor in bruce willis but br br the kid rusty is a smart aleck and whiny brat and willis rusty grown up now as russell gets abrasive with his constant yelling that is entertainment no thanks br br young breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor being involved in a number of films including the cat in the hat opposite a more famous child actor dakota fanning br br overall a disappointing film especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released
<START> twenty years after watching this i still find myself quoting things from this movie like look between the two giant melons or i'll start to sing the pabst blue ribbon theme on the other hand 20 years later i can now make sense of the meat machine as there's still a lot of the stereotypes like this out there that they used for this movie those are signs of a good movie to me i could say this movie stands the test of time which i can't really say for a lot of 80's movies i continue that this movie is still on a list of a lot of people's favorite movie as a kid growing up in the 80's if you like games and have dreams of becoming a game master or find yourself out over these 80's movies to relive your childhood you need to watch this also it's sometimes sarcastic and funny but one thing's for certain about this movie if someone ever invites you to a great all nighter they don't mean an x or acid trip party they mean get ready for some midnight madness oh you'll see everyone will be dying to play
<START> what exactly is the point of pretending to con people out of things like ski passes and pizza i fail to see a point i'd not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless br br skyler stone doesn't seem to be a very down to earth or even a nice guy he has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what he does in this show br br the worse thing about this piece of crap is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are so not only are they apparently conning the poor people on the other end of the phone but they are also conning the audience who don't have enough time to read the that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show br br not only that but he also claims this is how he lives his whole life what an lie no one could live their lives like this and the fact he says this is not only yet another con to get his show watched but it's also one of the most fabricated blatant pieces of bull hit i've ever heard this guy is an br br what makes them think that going to all the trouble of for example write and record a song get someone to pain a huge picture of you and two mates get dance lessons and actually travel to a ski resort is actually worth only getting free ski passes and some food for free what is the point of that it's an awful lot of trouble to go to just for a few ski passes and a bit of snow br br as far as comedy goes this is bottom of the barrel stuff
<START> harmony hate him or hate him on this evidence loathe might be a better word not him of course just everything he does but it could've been so different because the first ten minutes of this film promises so much including a fantastic idea of a michael jackson impersonator falling in love with a marilyn monroe impersonator fantastic and set in paris this could be great but unfortunately may spark the odd decent idea but because he is an awful writer the story fails on every level and the audience i witnessed about an hour in is proof positive that he is the most boring and pretentious film making out there apparently the walk out rate at its premiere in last years cannes festival was quite shocking instead of focusing on the two protagonists he switches the story stupidly to the confines of a chÃ¢teau to introduce a bunch of other impersonators making the whole experience tedious and narratively barren when will the independent cinema stop funding this upstart
<START> i have to agree that the movie is not the best i've ever seen but i would like to make mention that the actors portraying tommy and jimmy dorsey were the actual dorsey brothers as actors they were wonderful musicians the movie based on their famous split would have been better had professional actors played the parts many movies made during this time frame took advantage of the popularity of big bands most often the movies were not that good because musicians are not actors by trade most of the movie going audience didn't go to see tommy or jimmy dorsey playing themselves they went for the plot and the music i've never been much of a dorsey fan but the music is good even today br br i have to comment on a previous post regarding the actors who played mom and pop dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a dublin audience arthur shields and sara were actually irish actors both born in dublin you might remember mr shields as the reverend mr in the quiet man and ms as mrs monahan in cheaper by the dozen
<START> this was not a good film poorly scripted and acted the concept was not new the effects poor and not a showcase for arnold vosloo who really is a half decent actor i watched this under some protest and only remembered having seen it before towards the very end it's that forgettable the acting seemed to consist of a number of glares looks devoid of any sincerity i kept expecting this to actually get going and before long i was just hoping it would finish as for the medical bits well i wasn't expecting a true version of er events but this was just comical i am a dr so know what i am taking about and the operative bits were just plain silly br br do not waste your valuable time unless you have absolutely nothing else to do go out ring up a long lost friend watch paint dry sort out your sock draw do some household task avoid at your peril
<START> i say flick because this doesn't deserve the appellation movie and certainly not film i regret paying for the rental and although i've never walked out on a movie before this would have been it had i seen it in a theatre a society living underground in the future oooh that's original lots of burning barrel drums unexplained ambient light shining through windows an ungrateful woman and her shock muted son the list goes on and on c thomas howell affects the husky voice of the stereotypical loner you know like eastwood's been done to death he needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child yet in the flashbacks he's the same age talk about a poor memory i stared incredulously when the little boy abe randomly pushes a code into a door and it opens no tension pithy religious what religion under overtones saddest of all i expected better from roddy piper br br quite possibly the worst movie experience in my life
<START> i suppose it's quite an achievement to be able to present to an audience a true tail about a frail man a tail in which the protagonist will spend the majority of the film on his back in a bed and totally unable to move and yet the achievement is in the film's effectiveness as a dramatic piece as a recollection of a true story and i guess as an argument as to why people should have the right to die if they so wish to but the film isn't a political statement and perhaps thankfully it shies away from too many scenes of debate although it does include one for the sake of argument anyway more so this is one of those foreign language films that presents its lead character as a cripple whom can do nothing but talk to the people around him and yet is able to come across as engaging and compelling anyway br br so rather than be an out and out argument the film is more a sweet yet timely dramatic piece about another person wanting something or in search of something the only difference is that by attaining this 'goal' it would mean the termination of a someone's life and it would be achieved by not physically going anywhere javier bardem plays real life ramÃ³n an individual who at a much earlier age dived into a clearing of water that was too shallow for such activity this rendered him bedridden for the rest of his life and his wish to die is the focus of chilean director alejandro film we've seen so many films in our lives in which characters have certain or targets one must meet before the film is over to provide a satisfactory experience for the audience but the change of pace in the sea inside is gentle it does not involve young energetic attractive heroes going off to do battle in far off places but a real person after something that means so much to them br br even if you do have a strong policy either pro or anti euthanasia you may find yourself hoping ramÃ³n gets what he wants at the end of it all anyway the film sets its tone very early on with ramÃ³n giving a speech on why he wants to die to watching family members immediately introducing the situation and subject to the watching audience who may not know what the film is about interestingly some of the family members are 'anti' what he wishes which might place any audience member that feels strongly about the subject in their respective shoes but the purpose of this set up is to tell the audience 'no this isn't one man after something who incidentally has the whole of his family backing him to the end' quite easily the film could've gone down a route in which it is the family vs everybody else but some are anti idea some are too young to acknowledge what's really going on and others are seemingly too distraught to even have an opinion other than they just want ramÃ³n to stick around a bit longer they love him after all br br the sea inside is a following of a story revolving around a victim of sorts ramÃ³n is a and it is his perspective we see things from this is something that may viewers or have the film come across as quite odd given we are being presented with a film from the point of view of a victim rather than an instigator or a lead character in a film that is always inducing the cause in the cause and effect drive but this is no criticism and it's a credit to the director for delivering such an approach in the effective manner in which it is the film asks questions it offers a scenario to its audience if you were in position what would you do or think about or dream of or talk about consequently dreams about lawyer are not so much shot for the audience's pleasure as much as they are an ever so slight window into one man's escapist fantasies from his predicament br br the study of julia intensifies somewhat later on when a she begins to share certain similarities with ramÃ³n and that is when she begins to have strokes that are a result of a disease of her own this trait seems timely in the progression of their relationship and adds a further ingredient of connection on top of an already engaging friendship this is because julia feels the physical pain and restriction not in a sense that she isn't able to get up and walk but i think she realises the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt beforehand while the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia it feels like more of a down to earth drama about a man in a situation in which he is prepared to fight for what he wants but must do so verbally it's refreshing to see films like the sea inside as it not only references history and gives us an insight into that but as a stand alone film delivers on an emotional and engaging level
<START> don't hate heather graham because she's beautiful hate her because she's fun to watch in this movie like the hip clothing and funky surroundings the actors in this flick work well together casey affleck is hysterical and heather graham literally lights up the screen the minor characters goran visnjic sigh and patricia velazquez are as talented as they are gorgeous congratulations miramax director lisa krueger
<START> this was on the saturday before halloween this year today at the time of this writing and it has to be the best horror anthology out there i am normally not a fan of horror movies largely due to the volume of crap that's been recently released however the director of campfire tales has the hitchcock esquire gift of suspense unlike other contemporary films it doesn't take every opportunity to scare you silly instead using foreshadowing and 'near incidents that seem like the instant that the climax will occur in the instant before but turn out not to be br br i didn't catch 'the or the first main segment but from what i have read here they were the two you could afford to miss br br 'people can lick too' was full of suspense this short keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she wanders about her yard and house looking for her soccer ball and later her dog she encounters so many near misses that the suspense reaches heart stopping proportions before the climax of the short when the girl gives up and goes to bed thinking her dog is underneath it she reaches her hand down to let him lick it and she feels the touch of a tongue on her hand before noticing that on her mirror written in blood is 'people can lick too' i'll leave the last few seconds for you to find out my reader for at this point the short could have taken any number of turns br br 'the however was the masterpiece of this film it begins with a man on a motorcycle simply driving towards what he does not know but he can feel himself getting closer as he's driving along a storm breaks out and he's forced to find shelter in the house of a mute girl the two quickly cozy up to each other but before they can do anything besides kiss the girl reveals through writing that ghosts inhabit her house they quickly begin packing up to leave but they are caught in the middle of a reenactment of a scene decades past a father coming home to his daughter and her boyfriend preparing to elope murders the both of them and then commits suicide i'll have to leave you to discover the ending here as well i couldn't hope to do the story justice in any case and what i've said so far is just a brief summary of the story i couldn't hope to convey the nuances and sensory details that add to it br br 'the being the connecting thread between all of the stories is a fairly interesting rehash of the car accident theme and the girls are very much attractive in fact most of the girls in this film are good looking anyway despite the fact that it's chopped up the story is given justice and the ending is difficult to predict if you're preoccupied with the other stories however if you pay enough attention to the segments of the campfire spread through the film it's certainly possible to predict the ending especially if you've seen movies based on the same premise mst3k fans remember same premise but without the god awful writing of vivian schilling and the bulk of the movie if you've seen the first 30 minutes of that you should be able to predict the ending all in all the best horror movie i've seen in a long time and the only horror anthology worthy of a buy
<START> this is by far one the most boring movies i've ever seen and if you don't believe me go ahead and watch it for yourself br br the movie starts of slow the storyline makes no sense at all people fighting doesn't make any sense i could not make sense of what they were talking during the movie in most cases i didn't even bother it does nothing to keep you watching the movie the only plus point would be the cinematography new zealand looks awesome everything else just plain sucks br br the actors try their best to keep us awake but unfortunately you will go to sleep instead br br do us all a favor even if this gets on on demand don't watch it
