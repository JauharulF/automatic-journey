<START> an extremely powerful film that certainly isn't appreciated enough it's impossible to describe the experience of watching it the recent uk television adaptation was shameful too ordinary and bland this original manages to imprint itself in your memory
<START> i can't believe the high marks people have given this film on this site the writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at just the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape don't you just hate it when that happens and the acting is so very very bad that you may get a splinter in your eye from all the scenery being chewed br br a nut is holding her hostage children are outside the open screen so she whimpers for help instead of screaming when only a moment ago she was brave enough to be smashing windows to yell to these same children br br she's finally free and alone in the house her chance to go for help so what does she do wanders around the house and lies down she's in the basement locked away so what does she do takes a little nap come on most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when he wakes her up four times what if the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot why should we be paying attention i think the key here is that it was originally a play for the radio so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any action br br and the ending is horrendous br br the whole movie is completely implausible horribly written and almost comically acted beware this movie at all costs
<START> okay you hippies are probably wondering what i have against an education and informative show like barney well i have a lot of hate against it for these reasons br br 1 it teaches that having a personality and individualism is immoral no one on the show has a personality everyone dresses alike talks alike acts alike and dances alike even in the episode called being an individual kids try to tell barney about what they like and everyone on the planet should do what i like do you wanna teach your kid that being an individual is wrong br br 2 a stranger is a friend you haven't met episode while seemingly harmless the show's producers that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children in fact several young barney lovers from across the u s fell victim to pedophiles who were using the show's friendly message to lure children away from their parents the episode has since been pulled but the damage had been done so called innocent mistakes in programming like this one clearly show why parents need to watch television with their children br br 3 if your not happy all the time you are a bad person no one seems to show any other emotion but happiness no matter which situation they are in if the child's parents get mad or sad for some reason the child may think of mommy or daddy differently not a good message at all br br 4 magic solves everything seems like every problem is solved by magic at least in shows like fraggle rock it teaches us that magic can backfire at it is best to solve problems on your own does barney teach this no of course not there has to be magic in there and the problem is a lot of two year olds cannot tell fantasy from reality and might think their parents siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything yet become confused when they cannot use magic and think they are weird another boner pulled again br br 5 barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing he has even specifically said that stealing is okay if the person you steal from doesn't mind kids can learn that if you really want something stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it this is not something that need authority figures to tell them br br 6 if i just have the right thing i can solve all my problems whenever the kids have a problem barney gives them whatever they need to solve it the message being sent here is don't try to think to solve this it's too much work and the solution probably wouldn't work anyway just use this because of this children could stop thinking through things barney said it was too much work and become dependent on the right object the right shoes the right food the right computer the right exercise machine this is obviously a good message for the barney marketers but it's not good for br br 7 the message that cheating is okay in another episode the children are involved in a contest to carry a peanut on a spoon without dropping it one child puts peanut butter on his spoon and easily wins the child is then rewarded for his creative thinking when the child in fact bent the rules and changed the game so that he could win this teaches that cheating is good you win and people think that you are creative when in real life you will often be disqualified or worse and severely disliked by other competitors who played by the rules br br 8 do the kids in this show eat anything else besides cakes cookies and candy that teaches that it is okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food despite barney's so called health food song other than that everyone in the show eats junk food no wonder there are so many obese kids in america and europe br br and finally br br most other kids' television shows teach creative problem solving well without having to resort to magic barney could also have done that but instead decided to use the method that was a best for the marketers and b took the least time and money for scripts it's a blatant sellout that shows just how little the lyons group actually cares about children br br that is my rant for you all
<START> this movie probably seemed like a great idea in pre production let's make a movie about one of the greatest and most controversial athletic coaches of the modern era and let's cast brian as coach bobby knight that's where this movie went terribly wrong why cast an actor who bears no semblance of the man he's portraying and then why let this actor turn his character into not coach knight but brian in a red sweater as i sat watching this movie on espn i didn't find myself believing this man was actually coach knight he didn't look like him talk like him act like him or even walk like him i could not get past this fact and thusly i could not enjoy the movie when paul newman and robert redford were cast as the outlaws butch cassidy and the sundance kid we didn't care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters because most of us had never even heard of these men until we saw the movie but with someone as visible in today's media as coach knight you have to do better when anthony hopkins was cast as nixon it was the same situation but anthony hopkins made us believe he in fact was nixon didn't even try what might have been a great movie was turned sour by this besides the fact that this movie tried to do for the four letter word what saving private ryan did for dismemberment it stunk too little of the real coach knight and too much profanity for the sake of shock value turned this movie into a season to turn off half way through the broadcast the only good thing about this is that it was television movie i didn't have to waste my hard earned money on this piece of trash
<START> supposedly director william shatner had in mind a much film when it came to 'star trek v the final but the suits at paramount looking at the huge box office receipts taken in by its humor filled predecessor insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too so what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six star trek movies with the original cast there are bad ideas aplenty along with a few good ones and if you're in a charitable mood you could look at 'the final the same way you would a so so episode of the tv series on the plus side laurence is a fine actor and gives one of the best star' performances in any star trek big or small screen ranking right up there with william commodore decker his portrayal of spock's half brother consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink which happens all too frequently charles cooper is good too as the fat old klingon general too bad his role isn't as large as he is if the story about shatner's intentions is true then i owe him an apology because i was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and not very convincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet the reason is i've always felt that of all the trek regulars shatner was the least in' to everything that makes star trek work and what makes it special to its fans having read his trek memoirs it's very apparent to me that he considered the show another action adventure series that just happened to have a science fiction setting he preferred the vision of gene over that of gene roddenberry was known for his work on the popular western series 'the wild wild west ' shatner also mentioned that a favorite star trek episode of his was 'a piece of the action ' a silly second season episode co written by so finally given an opportunity to direct a star trek feature film would not shatner follow his instincts and produce an action filled flick with lots of tongue in cheek humor well somebody did because that's what 'the final ended up being shatner himself definitely returns to form as the great ham and as leonard maltin points out the film suffers from a bad case of 'the ' in the opening scene at yosemite national park it's hard to say which is worse the super cheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue running gags about equipment on the enterprise have run all the way from of and by this the fifth trek movie have run themselves into the ground so has the idea of a one new development is an apparent romantic relationship between scotty and uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two it's a pointless subplot and adds nothing the climactic scene where 'god' is encountered doesn't add much either whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable but the scene itself doesn't make much sense the 'god' creature's abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from 'the search for spock ' leonard nimoy manages to salvage spock's integrity even while spouting such un spock like lines as get a grip on yourself doctor and deforest kelley as usual outperforms both shatner and nimoy he really came on as an actor in the final trek films so this trek outing isn't terrible it just isn't very good there was to be one more original cast trek movie before the baton was passed to the 'next generation ' and it was far better suited to the task than 'star trek v the final frontier '
<START> keira knightley and sienna miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of dylan thomas knightley is thomas's boyhood sweetheart he re encounters during the blitz meeting at a bar they reconnect however things become complicated when thomas' brings his wife miller along the next time he meets her the women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become knightly's husband this further complicates things as jealousy begins to show its face br br beautiful to look at extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted everyone disappears completely into their roles this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and the ears it's so nice to see a film about adults being adults on a purely visceral level i really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing rarely have i ever seen a film that is this beautifully crafted br br the trouble with the film is i'm not entirely sure of everything that happened something seemed to be missing and a couple of times i had to replay the film to see if i missed something its not bad but its not completely satisfying as a result i tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but i couldn't find anything still i think this is a film worth seeing it's a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done
<START> i also saw the last stop at the moving pictures film festival in prince george i have to confess the only reason i went to see it is because i am a huge callum keith rennie fan and he didn't let me down he gave a good performance of a rather unsympathetic character and provided about the only comic relief in the whole movie br br the movie itself is the usual of bad people trapped in a snow storm together' storyline but it did have a couple of twists that kept me guessing the characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed fairly well the only problems i had with the cast was rose she was so cold throughout the movie that we didn't get any idea of her character's personality or motivations other than her and a few small problems with continuity this was a well written well acted thriller
<START> dresden had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget i was really looking forward to it and i really wanted it to be good but it is not the only good thing are the special effects that are very well done but like in a really bad hollywood blockbuster everything else is missing br br it is poorly written the screenplay tries to fulfill genre rules with standard suspense love story elements but there is no depth or originality at all it's way below average the next thing it is also poorly directed it has this uninteresting tv directing style with lots of close ups and wanna be great action by fast editing where actually no action or suspense is the actors are not bad but there is no performance that is touching in any way br br i don't know they obviously try to do a typical tv movie and not a film for the cinema where its alway good to have some edges and a clear visual style but why do they try to fulfill typical commercial hollywood rules it really feels like the screenwriter did a weekend class with some american scriptwriting guru and then delivered this mess is there no producer who is responsible for the project who has an interest in dramaturgy visual style or plain in simple this magical cinematic moments that make some tv movies great do they think that an tv audience is stupid and doesn't need to get a high quality movie experience the downfall was a very good example for a good tv movie but there was probably some executive or producer who knew what he was doing br br don't waste you time with this one rent downfall instead
<START> people may say i am harsh but i can't help it the movie is so bad i was absolutely stunned the first movie was bad enough if you ask me it was greatly exaggerated and silly but this one despite the creepy scenes has a seriously ass stupid story they actually went deep into investigating past and found out that she had a mother who miraculously speaks english who was an exorcist and fed evil spirits to her daughter stupid ok it started out with who was an ordinary housewife who had an affair with some bloke and got herself dead this part is still ok because of this moment of rage she became a vengeful spirit who kills anyone who enters her house now her killings began to stretch a little where she actually had the opportunity to travel throughout tokyo just to finish her victims her victims were travelling weren't they this struck me hard now if a ghost could actually do such a thing like travelling throughout a country without paying public transport fares i wouldn't mind being ask someone to come kill me then snorts and to crown things all up the ghost who was once depicted as a very vengeful one in ju on the grudge which was way better than this trash is now depicted as some spectre who truly enjoys herself and felt that it is her mission to finish of people things became worse for me the viewer when the ghost became coming in forms of large strands of hair i mean if a ghost had such power i seriously dun mind being one i never really liked movies depicting ghosts as monsters cause they're not the overall results is just plain bad like the grudge 2 with a better storyline and less exaggeration this show would have been better
<START> blind date is one of three stories made into movie by author vida hurst lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934 mickey rooney as a mouthy little punk he seems to be in the film for comedic and homey family values jane darwell again plays the strong willed mother just as she had in grapes of wrath and the oxbow incident ann sothern is kitty who has been dating bill paul kelly but meets up with rich bob played by neil hamilton who may or may not be better for her you can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the hays production code at one point kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house what a change from just a year or two prior when anything and everything was ok good solid plot but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk it raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice or just find a man with big bucks as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated and how do men change when their situation changes watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene tv viewers from the 1960s will recognize hamilton as commissioner gordon from batman also some weird drama in the off screen lives for some of the cast in this one paul kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle mickey rooney had an affair with norma shearer who was 20 years older rooney ended up being married eight times tyler brooke emory and spencer charters pa both knocked themselves off in real life the title blind date has been reused many times for films tv series and even cartoons but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one
<START> this terrible moovie is fun on many levels the moost obvious is the lame fake looking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets without ever flapping it wings like it was on a string perhaps attacking model trains and toy cars the science is asinine a masonic atom gun and what's up with the enormous amounts of in everyone's hair i guess the 50's were the slimeball decade well this bird puppet apparently comes from some god forsaken anti matter universe and it's here to build a nest lay eggs in new york seriously that they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame i give it 1 hoof out of 4 it's silly and stupid but moore fun than armageddon 8
<START> deepa mehta roy and a host of other so called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because of the fact that they love portraying india and hinduism in a bad light and deepa mehta makes her money from it anyway anyway hindus are too gentle or scared to protest the way muslims protest so anybody can take any liberties with hinduism and it is a fact that during the 1930's women in the west were also when they were widowed just that nobody likes to point out anything bad about the west or anything other than india and hindus she paints an portrayal of india and the situation of widows there nowhere is it mentioned that child marriage is illegal she ended the movie saying there are 34 million widows in india of course among a billion people there will be that many widows but how many are living life she has depicted in the movie deepa mehta finally is selling india and poverty to make dollars how pathetic
<START> contains spoilers br br this movie is utter crap do not watch br br there is no one in this movie to root for or even like except for the wife and she wins by default everyone is selfish and many things happen that make no sense br br the acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything no one can even cry believably br br if you leave the room for even a second then something totally out of left field will happen and it will make no sense whatsoever br br for example i left the room for a second while jennie character was sleeping with her manager i come back seriously about 4 minutes later also i'm pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere in there and she's sleeping with that guy br br i gave up on this movie around the time that was being an ass to his fiancÃ© in the car because she didn't want to call off the wedding br br i wasted 2 hours of my life you shouldn't
<START> did we all see the same movie i can't believe the raves some of the others are giving this really awful bio which believe or not was authorized by shirley temple herself based on her book child star gives me the feeling that some are awfully easy to please br br first of all ashley rose orr whatever her modest talents are in no way shape or form even resembles shirley temple enough to be cast as her in this sort of straightforward biography of the world's most famous child star she gives no indication of why or how this child was so revered except for trying her hardest to do a shirley impersonation which never clicks on any level none whatsoever br br and that is the major handicap of the whole piece but as if that isn't bad enough any drama inherent in shirley's story of her climb to almost overnight stardom has been completely white washed with insipid writing peppered with occasional song and dance moments that don't even approximate what shirley did as for example the codfish ball with buddy ebsen which was probably the high point of shirley's choreographed dance routines br br simply putting a girl in a polka dot dress doesn't make her shirley temple none of shirley's own brand of charm warmth and appeal is even remotely suggested all we see on display is a pale imitation of the original proving once and for all that there was only one shirley temple br br it's worthless to write anything further about this mess none of the others are more than ordinary in lifeless roles my advice for shirley's fans is to read her book or better still watch her movies br br this is the pits
<START> this started out slow then got worse the best parts of this were all seen in the previews br br bad apple has the feel of a pilot if that's the case tnt should save their money
