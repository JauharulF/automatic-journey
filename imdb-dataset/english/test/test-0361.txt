<START> i don't think the number of blunders militarily and strategically contained in this turkey can be beaten everything in this mess was done on the cheap and made soldiers look really stupid examples at the start the 2 star general is given strategic advice by a lieutenant and accepts it unquestionably the map used by the lt shows enemy positions but they apparently have only a single narrow valley to use in advancing on the battalion even though the map showed a dozen more the rear guard takes up position from which they are clearly spotted by the enemy and exposed they pound our heroes from high ground but this superior fire power makes little difference an single enemy tank advances near the end at the beginning referred to as armored division proceeded by a solitary infantry point who moves extremely slowly without cover scouting the area then the tank on when he deems it save to proceed a most bizarre scene the soldiers take cover in a cave all around them is ice and deep snow but in the cave not a yard from the entrance is a deep puddle through which they all wade repeatedly their feet would last mere minutes before they freeze off later the survivors wade pathetically slowly and chest high through a river to return to their unit remember it is deep winter and the ground is frozen yeah right br br and on and on it goes they yell commands to positions on higher ground they lay mines near their own position and warn each other not to trample on them at the start credit is given to some soldier who had been awarded the congressional medal of honor was he blind or did director fuller just ignore him truly the most inept soldiers i've ever seen br br one of them pokes around in his own wounded leg with a bayonet and eventually pulls out a piece of without a wince or a moan he announces that that should qualify him as a surgeon now that was funny
<START> hey it's only tv sure it's star trek the most beloved bla bla and this is a great one but it's all relative what it boils down to is a guy in elf ears grooving with a swatch of pizza colored shag rug br br there's a kind of third man to the tunnel hunt and it's creepier than many episodes of what is after all one of the better tv shows the suspense is actually suspenseful the peril really feels perilous as a little kid i think i cried when spock told me that this hideous creature was as sad scared and horrified as the people it was eating this was one of my early lessons in empathy a lesson reinforced by the episode which was if less thrilling even more melancholy br br what bothered me when i was five was that this thing which looks like meat and tomato barf somehow actually consists more or less of rock now that kind of choice might seem visionary a hippie designer's idea of through the looking glass one but it might also just smack of the drug era
<START> way too many christian films become centered around the fear of the judgment and as a result come across as condescending and cheesy second glance gets it right this is a near perfect evangelical tool it deals with the real reason why so many young people want nothing to do with christianity it assures viewers that one must give up their sin not their fun to succeed in the christian lifestyle second glance even works as a piece of film making the filmmakers obviously were working on a very low budget but they managed to write a script dynamic enough to divert viewers' attention from this obvious fact this film brought me to my lord and savior jesus christ and thanks to christian stations everywhere which show it it surely has impacted more people than just me
<START> it may not have had the big budgets celebrities or endorsements of scream urban legend or i know what you did last summer but campfire tales had one thing these three movies lacked true horror br br this film tackled the subject of urban legends a year before the aptly titled and less than enthralling urban legend did it was intriguing masterfully scripted and logical in a way i know what you did last summer could only dream of finally it held its focus and finished with a flurry while scream fizzled and died br br what's most exciting about the film is the variety of horror that the writers and directors achieved the overarching story of teenagers around a campfire was classic dread at the unknown but certainly expected doom that awaited them in the forest but the tales themselves are where the movie really shined br br the opening sequence is pure fast paced urban myth it's based on a popular legend and the director plays on this with the style and pace of the action making it more enthralling because we know what's going to happen br br the first campfire tale is a straight forward thriller based on another popular myth we don't actually realize this until the end both because it blends so well into the story and because the action keeps our attention being the thriller of the trilogy this one plays off our fear of the unknown and includes several well done jump sequences that don't feel nearly as cheap or contrite as those in movies like scream or urban legend br br the second tale is more suspense this time though the characters still don't know what's going on we do and this provides the horror no need for cheap thrills here br br the final tale contains elements of the supernatural and uses a creepy trippy atmosphere to scare the viewer because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation our fear comes from their intensity and what they can't explain this is the true ghost story of the trio br br i didn't expect to enjoy campfire tales when i rented it i figured that if i didn't like its more acclaimed bigger budget counterparts how could i like it br br the truth is though this film succeeds where the others fell far short of the mark
<START> dear scifi channel how have you been how was your summer i've been ok but i feel like our relationship isn't the same anymore and we're growing apart i don't understand why you don't love me anymore i've just finished watching your scifi channel original skeleton man and once again you've shown a blatant lack of respect for my feelings by killing off every hot girl in this movie i mean i understand that you're just in this for instant gratification all you care about is producing a movie where people get sliced and diced by a homicidal indian spirit creature legend whatever so you really don't have time to put some thought and effort into anything else like finding a costume for skeleton man that doesn't make him like the gay lover of skeletor from he man seriously his robe looks like a satin blanket sheet and his skull is smooth as a baby's behind he almost looks like a killer halloween costume for a 6 year old as he marches through the wilderness on a homicidal rampage so we throw you a bone because we're not looking for oscar winning performances intriguing plot or realistic character reactions to the situations at hand because we realize that even though michael rooker caspar van diem and all the girls are supposed to be trained special ops agents they are all mysteriously transformed into keystone kops who can't shoot or see straight whenever skeleton man appears and we also fully expect that nothing bullets explosions electrocution nothing can kill skeleton man until there is one minute left in the movie and we need to find a way to tie things up neatly we expect to see blood and guts but you have a knack for taking the least attractive actress in the entire cast and making her the only female who survives and quite honestly i think you do it just to me because this movie as silly as it is has the potential to be a so bad it's good classic and just killing off all the hotties ruins everything and forces me to lower its rating all i ask is that once just once you take my feelings into account and let the sexiest girls survive the movie please
<START> i grew up in winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday there are good and bad in every race why make them all out to be bad that goes for all races today john harper was an educated man he graduated from high school he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve how do i know this john harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation he was a kind and gentle soul he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right i wasn't very old when he left our house but i can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother couldn't be bothered he even taught grade 3 the year before he came to winnipeg none of this is mentioned in the movie and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as i'm concerned what happened to john is unforgivable not only in the native community but also in the white community not everyone in winnipeg think like the police do i knew the person inside and what he was like as a person not an indian
<START> the film listed here as having been made in 1980 is not the film which is available from something weird video in their driver's ed scare films vol 5 for one thing the 1980 version is in color has on this disc an earlier version 1972 of the film made in b w for television channel 5 in cincinnati either way this film is notorious however unlike most other driver's ed films this was intended for television broadcast and viewing by the general public thus the level of carnage has been down it's still a pretty grim exercise in exploitation of bloody death for a purported educational intent i live in the cincinnati area and i remember this thing being shown every year around prom time on channel 5 if you're looking for one film that demonstrates the tone of this uniquely american film phenomenon the last prom is pretty typical morose hyperbolic extremely didactic heavy on melodrama whether it really affected any teenager's driving at all is anyone's guess
<START> there are a lot of people that put down on these type 80's movies but those people may not have been coming of age during this time i was just starting college when this movie was released so i could really appreciate it at the time and my friends and i still to this day will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie as much as i liked sean penn's character jeff in fast times i actually enjoy chris penn's character tommy more because he is the lead character with more of a actual speaking roll opposed to just a series of one liners such as with chris penn should probably pop this film in his vcr and use it for motivation to lose some weight yes the subplot with the randy quaid vietnam vet character does seem a little out of place but he does a convincing job in the role if there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie but liked the other similar type movies such as fast times etc i highly recommend it
<START> firstly let me get this of my chest i hate octopussy with an absolute passion what is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence unfortunately post the opening sequence it all goes downhill firstly there was absolutely no plot to begin with just an excuse for moore to tell his corny jokes next there are several sequences that would make a bond fan cringe for instance the sequence in which bond turns up to a bomb dressed as a clown the villains are pretty poor louis fails to make an impact as kamal khan and bollywood veteran kabir bedi is equally poor as his henchman it's funny that when people debate over what the worst bond movie is and octopussy gets overlooked when it can easily give them a run for their money
<START> playwright john look back in anger the entertainer dramatisation of oscar wilde's only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original perhaps too much so nonetheless the dialogue the acting with a cast headed by sir john gielgud jeremy brett and the brilliantly cerebral production marred only by a too quick ending make this worth the while of any lover of theater with a capital t
<START> i've heard that this move was put together by a bunch of high school students as a high school art or theatre project it's not too bad unless you lived near in the seventies or knew someone involved in the making of the movie this is pretty awful most of the actors are clearly not actors but locals who volunteered bob wilkins the original host of creature features on in oakland appears but only for about a minute some of the monster effects are done with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster suit and each works okay on it's own but there is no continuity between the two watching without dialog you'd assume that the movie had 2 monsters i guess the most aspect is that even the main characters who i assume are the kids behind the movie cannot even pretend to act these kids must have been involved in theater in some way to want to do this project but they display zero believable emotion in front of the camera
<START> each frame in the movie is a lesson to new directors or existing directors to know how a movie should be taken hats off to he is underestimated in indian film industry the director has got all the qualities in taking this movie in the range of ray every character is portrayed effectively in the movie though it's simple story it's been taken to such extent it can be considered to one of the best in india i don't have enough adjectives to praise the movie just as the way the life goes in day today atmosphere the movie has been taken though the songs in indian movies are considered to a weak area songs in this movie has given extra energy to the potential of the movie especially background score it's amazing
<START> let me first just say that in the past i have been a huge carlin fan i think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way and give us his unique perspective on those things it wasn't always meant to be funny but you always respected his opinions because they were presented in such a clever way but you are all diseased is just a long rant he doesn't give us any unique perspective on anything he just gives us a long list of stuff that he's p o 'd at there is no insight no cleverness just an old man complaining for one hour straight about things that we have all complained about and on top of that it wasn't even funny you are all diseased appeals to dumb people who can't handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct i don't mind anger fueled comedy but george could have done so much better i really hope that george carlin's next show will live up to the quality that george has shown in the past
<START> this film infuriated me for the simple fact that it was made only because shepherd was gay the men who murdered him are clearly wicked what happened to the poor man was truly horrible and a tragedy however where was hollywood when four religious white kids were executed after being forced to perform a host of sex acts on their killers and each other by two evil black men in wichita just two years ago the celebrities only mug for the camera when it serves a political purpose also laramie is portrayed in a poor light by this pseudo documentary which of course is hardly surprising because they are the backward hicks who must be educated by omniscient and enlightened californians still it's always a treat to see laura linney
<START> i saw this movie many years ago have tried to locate it but perhaps understandably it is nowhere to be found it was so esoteric yet one of a handful of movies that remains with you for a long time i am still not sure what the reality of the movie is and perhaps like the uncertainty principle the obscurity is the definite thing acting is superb the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of foreboding an overall permeates yet it is hard not to be absorbed in the story i rented it thinking it was science fiction it was in the sci fi section with some totally misleading blurb but quite clearly it is not or horror or even suspense in fact one feels thankful the director took the courage to make a movie like this for which obviously there is no solid audience i know some people have complained about klaus kinski's short role but i think it is very appropriate his limited exposure is critical to the formation of the mystery of this movie
