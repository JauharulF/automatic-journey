<START> predictable gory over gimmicky mediocre don't waste your time there are many much better movies out there br br resurrection starts out ok but the plot quickly becomes repetitive my interest level fell off steadily by the end of the movie i was just glad it was finally over the characters never fully developed the cinematography is muddy and the quick change pov rotations while impressive in 1999 perhaps presently merely serve to label the movie as attempting to substitute gee whiz flash for plot and character substance the film shooting gimmicks serve some purpose convey tension and anxiety but are constantly overused and ultimately become counterproductive a shame overall the film story obviously had potential and the producers directors and actors obviously have technical skill a disappointment
<START> i like to think of myself as a bad movie connoisseur i like to think that the films most people label as the worst of all time i can easily withstand br br but there are exceptions i can only recall three movies i have had the misfortune to see that i have repeatedly used the fast forward button for large chunks of the story those movies are the mighty gorga night of the seagulls and this little crap deep blood br br in the world of jaws ripoffs this falls off the scale deep blood doesn't have the realistic storyline of the original crocodile nor the incredible effects of the sea serpent nor the commentary of tintorera no instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed '80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff br br shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors thrashing about in the water occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orange ish paint thrown into the water not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump br br normally i or somebody like me would read a dismal review like this one and say cool i gotta find a copy of this that's the same thought i had when i read another viewer's review on this very site how wrong i was br br so from one bad movie fan to another let this collect dust on the shelf grab up from the depths or the great alligator instead to satisfy your need for something evil lurking in the water
<START> this movie is so predictable when you know the modern american dream do nothing be a loser and then suddenly whoah you're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on br br and surprisingly all the other smart people are losers they don't know anything and are bitter when our solves problems so easily and what kind of problems they are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds br br every movie has something good in it anyway and robin williams is it in this one
<START> spoilers warning i cannot say enough good things about this movie it is a great horror comedy spoof that does everything right for a change the humor is great and ranges from funny to so funny you'll cry funny in one scene ed goes edit crazy and deletes a big scene when his boss is looking at ed's edit he yells out where in the fu is my beaver rape scene hysterical there are also many other great humorous memorable quotes and moments throughout ed yells out don't you fu ing look at me while punching some poor schmuck repeatedly in the face very funny stuff the plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that it's priceless ed is a mild mannered everyday guy that gets moved over to the horror film editing department and after a while goes nuts sees monsters and attacks people while quoting the horror movies that he has edited this movie has it all and is simply hilarious the dvd only costs about 7 and is a great bargain as it is the unrated widescreen cut i own a lot of dvd's most of which cost a lot more money than this one but not many are as great as this movie my evil ed dvd is one of the highlights of my collection and i would beat someone with a telephone receiver if they tried to steal it evil ed oozes style and quality something that hollywood filmmakers need to majorly learn evil ed is a rare gem and i would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie you did everything right and i love evil ed 10 out of 10
<START> br br it wasn't the worst movie that i have ever seen however that is only if i get to count home movies made by 8 year olds this movie was horrible from start to finish nothing about it made it worth watching unless you wanted to show new filmmakers how not to make a film
<START> this is a children's tv series about a mary sue who is at the same time mean and bitchy i couldn't bring my self to sit through 3 episodes of not to mention that jamie lynn spears can't act to save her life what message does this show bring to kids if you're not perfect like zoey you're unworthy br br it's absurd how character is exactly the type of person who would be despised in real life yet she manages to become so popular then there is chase who is basically a lovesick puppy who worships the ground zoey walks on then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been dumbed down in order to stop them from outshining zoey i'm sorry but the characterization in this show extremely unrealistic
<START> i really wanted to like this film however after an amusing opening few minutes i hardly cracked a smile i agree there was no chemistry at all between the two leads and the other characters were cliche ridden the script totally wasted the talents of bud tingwell and kim br br it must be said however that there was plenty of laughter around me and even a smattering of applause at the end perhaps i just couldn't relate to it enough i'm just glad i went on cheap tickets
<START> from the perspective of the hectic contemporary world in which we live the so called good old days' always seem so much more serene and innocent an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen as with christmas in connecticut ' a warm and endearing film directed by peter godfrey barbara stanwyck stars as elizabeth lane a popular martha type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in connecticut always with the latest recipe at the center of the story one of her biggest fans is alexander yardley played by sidney greenstreet the publisher of the magazine for which she writes yardley has never visited her farm and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse mary joyce compton he decides to spend an old fashioned christmas with elizabeth her husband and child and as a special guest a certain mr jefferson jones dennis morgan a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss but there are problems not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a high rise in the city it makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor dudley beecham robert shayne as the one thing mr yardley demands from his employees is total honesty what follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place to share a christmas past where a warm hearth good food and kindness prevail br br barbara stanwyck absolutely sparkles as elizabeth with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor whose trust in his fellow man is admirable even with the deceptions being played out around him he's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet and in the end it's elizabeth you really feel for one of the true delights of this film however is sidney greenstreet his yardley has a gruff exterior but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as texas it's a straightforward honest portrayal and it's a joy to watch him work the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him br br the supporting cast includes reginald gardiner john sloan the terrific una o'connor norah frank jenks and dick elliott judge crothers a feel good movie that plays especially well during the christmas season though it would work any time of the year christmas in is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be it's a true classic and one you do not want to miss i rate this one 10 10 br br
<START> the film was half over before i managed to figure out what was going on it's a dog's breakfast of a movie about four family thanksgiving dinners the cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other when it's all over ten hours later well it seems like ten hours you're puzzling over what it was all about i don't want to see a movie about dinner table squabbling there is enough of it in my own family the turkeys looked pretty good the rest gave me indigestion
<START> background info the movies octopussy never say never again were both made the same year 1983 and so naturally people compare them moore vs connery bond vs bond br br i've heard many people claiming that the official movie octopussy is far superior well i just watched octopussy bond is riding an airplane at 100 miles an hour impossible the wind would blow him off using his feet to force the plane to ground and then jumping off at some 60 miles an hour again impossible try jumping out of your car you'd end up with a shattered body how is that octopussy scene supposed to be good in any sense of the word suddenly bond has super human strength a titanium body and he does all these stunts at the ancient age of 56 complete crap unbelievable farse br br now let's contrast the above scene with connery's unofficial never say never again it doesn't have the same polish due to its independent film status less money but at least you can believe that connery is a real spy in real danger br br the movie starts off with bond showing his age he is 50 after all and being sent off for entirely believable but of course there's no such thing as a day off for a world famous spy and bond quickly finds himself a target even inside the hospital from that point the story spins off into another adventure with bond trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weapons br br as usual sean connery did a brilliant job and avoids the over the top unbelievable stunts this movie feels like a natural successor to connery's last film diamonds are forever the old style of bond before the franchise got silly br br recommended
<START> the guy mentioned to sue for the 1 5 hours wasted of his life i cant disagree on that one the movie started as some kind of class project cam thing and ended up in a dark room whenever the girls where fully nude there magically appeared light all over i know i dint write the script or having anything to say about it but this one is like a bad remake copy of saw with a bad ending to think of a man who actually wrote this story sick this is really a shocking movie cant say ist horror cause its not its mere the brutality and the violence that made me sick it really is frustrating to watch a movie without ending its like bang in your face the movie is done now you can go home br br cons cam lighting i think is was supposed to overdone sickening br br cons real in your face acting was good in my opinion it sucks you in br br overall the movie is not my taste of movie the wanted us to know that these things happen and the man wrote his own little fantasy if you ever saw the movies saw they all had a moment of comfort in it something to hold on to this one does not maybe its just me that im too soft but this movie made me tremble and the story is real short sick man kills girls slowly but the actors sucked you in this movie every blow every scream you could almost feel it br br and to be honest i was to quick to judge about this one its a terrible movie no its not its an overdone example of reality this is a real as it could get but don't watch this movie if you expect great mystery or a real plot or even some kind of story man gets girls in a dark room and kills em one by one thats really it
<START> loved this movie kicking it old school love the idea love the script love the characters i really really really loved the geeks i was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored this was right up with my such as saturday the 14th and pandemonium if you are a big fan of scary and silly then this is your movie only taken off one star because i would love to have had better sound not bad sound but would have liked to have more great blood splatters great murder weapons great costumes i really love the nod to the great 80's teenager stereotype ala breakfast club and i can appreciate the non cgi suspense really good camera action and light suspense instead of cutting to cgi i would rather have good fake that really fake fake br br kisses to the cast and makers oh loved the making of too
<START> this movie is just brilliant srk's acting is just amazing the end is so incredibly sad i cry every time i see this film it's the kind you never get sick of and can see again and again an absolutely amazingly brilliant movie
<START> if you speak french or can put up with sub titles you will really enjoy this movie if on the other hand you just want to see god's most beautiful creatures this is a must see not an ounce of silicon in sight zalman king eat your heart out sophie body is the epitome of perfection and everything i had ever fantasized about her part is even in english even the fact that she was nude with john malkovich did not detract for her beauty sophie is a ten if ever there was one chiara caselli and are 9 5s oh yeah it is a pretty good story several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of six degrees of separation style
<START> the most fertile man in ireland revolves around manley who is 24 year old and still happens to be a virgin he lives with his mother in belfast he is also a very shy guy towards women everything has changes for when he is seduced by a woman as far as i can remember a neighbour it is not because he looses his virginity but he discovers that he has a super power despite having protection this neighbour becomes pregnant he is told by the doctor that he has very high sperm count his mother brilliantly comes up with an idea which makes us see ginger headed babies all around in the end of the film he starts helping out women in both side of belfast to conceive babies first voluntarily then with the help of his colleague runs a business out of it the most fertile man in ireland has its funny moments but needed to come up with better jokes and with a better script i couldn't help thinking that it gave me the impression of a tv sitcom rather than a movie kris marshall is a different name on the silver screen but does not shine as star it's more like the guy you saw in such and such movie like him being in love actually i think he was very funny in that one well it was okay to watch but couldn't help dozing off from time to time out of
