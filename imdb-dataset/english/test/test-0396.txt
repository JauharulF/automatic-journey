<START> the first time i had heard of guest house was in the er washroom after having just seen fight club in each urinal was deposited a small round black circle when the circle came into contact with moisture to put it delicately it caused a colour picture to form with photographs of the two stars and the tag line you'll p yourself laughing when you'd finished washing your hands the circle had dried and faded to black again waiting to spring it's surprise on the next victim br br okay maybe the punchline wasn't terribly sophisticated but you have to admit it was innovative in fact i think i can honestly say i've never seen anything like it in my life before and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing that's a real feat what a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise br br i hate to pan guest house and i am indebted to richard and adrian eddie elizabeth for many years of laughter through their appealing television series be it the invention of the young ones 1982 1984 the sitting room plays of bottom 1991 1995 or even solo work such as in the new statesman 1988 1993 in fact this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special unfortunately its an 89 minute film br br there's definitely some merit to be had and i laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale which spoofed the exorcist and raiders of the lost ark and involved well you'll have to see that bit for yourself yet often the pace is leaden and a sterile atmosphere is throughout the two stars taking his usual backseat this time due to the fact that he adequately directs never really get into first gear only sporadically showing the foul mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen indeed the writers' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being to the audience the slight hints of depth seen in the series richie's effeminate failed social climbing for example are not present here and instead we are left with parodies of parodies br br the fawlty towers accusation does pass water complete with drunken chef and unseen called for waiter which uncannily rhymes with manuel some of the ideas such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens' swing hanging over a cliff face are very very funny but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn't there and all the dead laugh areas patched up with incidental comedy music that would have been dated in a carry on film two decades ago br br brand of puerile sadistic perverse humour is funny and i feel sure it will make you laugh just not as often as it should
<START> this is one of the best films made about the 80 punk scene i saw this a few years back on a bootleg copy and was amazed very few of todays kids know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80s punk legends such as the germs and shows how it was back then nowadays so much punk has gone mainstream with mtv and radio and its nice to see the true underground rebellious movement of the original scene darby crash of the germs is one of my heros and this film shows why a must see for all punks and anyone curious about the 80s punk scene
<START> a texas community is beset with a rash of mysterious killings involving some of the students from the local college the sheriff investigating the death discovers the startling identity of the killer responsible for the murders a nasa experiment involving cosmic rays has mutated an ape and turned it into an unstoppable killing machine with a thirst for blood according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br or could the creature really be a mutated alligator returning from a space bound noah's ark br br a long opening with laughably straight 1960s couple ralph baker jr as chris and dorothy davis as judy suggests night fright might be a joyously bad movie but don't get your hopes up after some innocent cavorting the attractive collegiates discover another couple has encountered a monster naturally the creature is hell bent on terrorizing young romantics sheriff john agar as clint crawford isn't trusted by the younger set but he really wants to help br br mr agar was a friend of my aunt he spoke about very few movies and this wasn't one of them
<START> has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet i can see that a lot of people have inquired but i can't tell if any of them have been successful it's hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country how can this be true and what can we do to change it as an aside i agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site this is an excellent story about events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today lots of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway now we want to share it with our children but we can't if that is true what would some good written materials be that would relay the same information
<START> this is ten times better than who wants to be a super model on bravo i think it is more true to the business tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiring model the photos look for depth in each of the models in personality and beauty strength and demure attributes and the ability to endure and work for what they want i enjoy seeing personal experience brought into the photo shoots and on the runway i don't always agree with the judges or comments and at least one of the winners i feel did not deserve to win but this is just a show and every girl on there is very lucky to have this chance
<START> like 'singin' in the rain' girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl in girl' phil silvers genius is the comic relief he corresponds to donald o'connor's funny man part in in the rain' in cover girl gene kelly's love interest is rita hayworth and in it's debbie reynolds that's where the comparison ends br br whereas singin' in the rain' is a classic american movie musical girl' is mediocrity incarnate the story isn't very complicated rusty parker rita hayworth is a dancer in danny low rent nightclub in brooklyn rusty decides to enter a cover girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher john who made an unsuccessful play for grandmother years ago introduces rusty to broadway producer noel wheaton who makes her into a star danny feels slighted when rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick genius at the last minute with rusty at the altar with noel she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to danny they live happily ever after br br gene kelly has the least developed part in the movie all we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with rusty and wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward rusty and phil silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick the most interesting aspect of rita hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk this foreshadows what happened to her in real life anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked hollywood away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full blown alzheimer's during the last years of her life br br almost all of the songs in cover girl are old fashioned and not very tuneful gene kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his ego' earlier the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of 'make em from 'singin' in the rain' br br the most annoying thing about girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal a couple of decades later raquel welch had the same problem both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities they wanted to be known as and not girls' unfortunately girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain
<START> this is what james cagney is all about wisecracks cockiness hard as nails and no nonsense charisma br br although the plot sounds serious the film is anything but it is done in the 30's screwball comedy style and works well with his with fiancÃ© mae clark and his reactions to the tall stories of his colleague james burke br br what raises it above normal is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it dialogue is good but it is nothing unless delivery is spot on and can bounce about the characters involved this is done well by all throughout br br good entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable
<START> the beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980's new york this involves fighting with the other street gang that they directly share a high school class with trying to stay in school as well as going to local shows that involve bands that look like the dead kennedy's and have the name skulls for their band name rex played by david jacobson plays an autistic kid who starts to get a long with all of these kinds and starts to show them that poetry is really beautiful and if applied to what these kids do in life can really make things work out for the better billy kane played by william mcnamara and kate kane played by kara glover are brother and sister although they roll with this crowd of thugs these kids are not the same type of people as this group they care for rex and they care for others and really show an enlightened side of themselves while his sister sleeps with the head of the gang she is also falling in love with rex trying to show him that she is not a slut but in the end the teachers at the school finally get to him and want to put him in a mental institution he finally feels it is time to end his life while animals of sound played without him but they like to think that he is not dead he is just living his life to the fullest riding sharks and being happy living in the ocean this movie was one of those movies where i was glad that i watched it while it was extremely entertaining it also had a big message to it something a long the lines that these kids had no direction no future no figure heads to look up to but because a troubled kid came along they all realized that there was way more important things to life then fighting the local black kids or being destructive to everything rex showed them the beauty in angry music rex showed them the beauty in rats disease and murder rex showed they the beauty in almost everything while some of those things have no beauty involved they still were able to see that when used in poems these poems speak to people rex played an important part in this move who changed everyones heart from depression to see that there is hope for them and thats why he started to show them the beat
<START> only the valiant qualifies as a gritty good western this gregory peck cavalry versus the indians oater is a solemn suicide mission without a trace of humor veteran director gordon douglas has helmed a grim harrowing outdoors epic with an ideal cast of tough guys under considerable pressure even lon chaney jr registers superbly as a powerful arab trooper ostensibly colorado territory scenarist edmund h north a place in the sun scribe harry brown drew their screenplay from western film maker charles marquis warren's taut novel about a group of die hard cut off from any escape route who must prevent murderous from launching a devastating raid against helpless white settlers north and brown stick to warren's novel for the most part and the last minute revelation when it seems that there is no way that our heroes can survive another onslaught of native a corker this turn of the century tale develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action douglas and company take studio bound sets and make them look convincing during the nocturnal hours the crisp black white photography of going my way cinematographer lionel linden imbues this western a grim look that accentuates its tension and atmosphere actor michael who later played the chief villain in guns of the magnificent seven is extremely effective in a small role as the hated indian leader br br only the valiant opens with over voice narration by army scout joe harmony this is my stamping ground i'm a scout for the army had my work cut out for me for a long time behind that pass there is the whole nation there is a graphic of the territory with the mountains stretching across the screen with a pass they used to come swarming out of the pass killing everything in sights then we built a invincible it plugged up the pass just like a cork in a bottle things was fine for a while but them is pretty smart one day the bottle blew the cork plum apart we are shown the burning remains of fort invincible with a dead man pinned to a stockade wall and a lance sticking out of his belly captain richard lance gregory peck of 12 o'clock high and his men boil in on horseback and capture michael and joe harmony jeff corey of true grit wants to shoot him on the spot harmony points out is the fella that started this whole business captain lance intervenes the army doesn't shoot prisoners joe predictably harmony is aghast at this prospect he's no common injun he's just as near to a god as a fella can get if you shoot him now things will quiet down without stirring them up the rest of those indians will get reasonable just as fast as they can you take him in alive you'll have every in the territory coming after him we have had three years of this you can stop it now just as predictably captain lance refuses to kill and lance's decision to take the indian back sets things into action br br colonel drum herbert of union station surprises lance when he tells him he should have shot as it is they need to get to another post everybody from the troopers to joe harmony knows that taking to fort grant is asking to die the apaches are poised in the mountains and the fort is under strength meantime we are introduced to the daughter of captain cathy barbara payton of kiss tomorrow goodbye and young lieutenant william holloway gig young of they shoot horses don't they and they play a part in a major narrative complication you see lance and holloway both want to marry cathy clearly cathy wants lance colonel drum refuses to let lance take to fort grant because drum cannot spare lance drum changes the orders and holloway is given the mission at the last minute and everybody is shocked lance has never changed an order furthermore lance saw cathy and holloway kissing in public and everybody thinks lance has reassigned holloway out of jealousy indeed one officer observes that rewriting orders is about a possible as rewriting the bible predictably escapes and the surviving troopers and harmony bring back a dead holloway br br although drum expects a relief column of 400 troopers to arrive any day harmony points out to lance that will attack has seen the fort and knows their lack of strength lance requests to take 6 or 7 men of his choosing to man fort invincible and prevent from assembling a war party the in the mountains keeps the indians from riding through in strength instead they must come through one at a time lance believes his men can thwart them until the relief column arrives drum gives him permission and lance picks the worst men all of them hate him and would willingly kill him br br only the valiant exemplifies the new breed of military western after world war ii this is not a gung ho john ford cavalry western indeed lance's own men want to kill him and this foreshadows the attitude of troops during the vietnam war when they their own officers lance bears the onus of the few who know about the circumstances that brought about the change of orders putting holloway in charge of the detail the black white photography enhances the dire nature of this western only the valiant amounts to a last stand western until the last minute reprieve reportedly peck hated this movie but then this is not a spit and polish western in technicolor if anything only the valiant lives up to its warner brothers origins it is small but significant and it is grubby with loads of drama and unsavory characters virtually a dirty dozen western
<START> this has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies charles band made the best movie of in this little seen gem highly realistic and incredibly stylised with a visual flair david fincher would envy its not hard to see why band went on to make such classics as 2 deliverance from evil' 'the regina pierce affair' of sherwood and tales of the saddle br br with a highly sophisticated story a tiny body with a large head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer but for those who see it band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece the head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for one's inner self that we all must face at one point or another and for this reason i was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level although many earlier critics have compared band's film to re animator and other lesser works this stands head and heels above the rest it is gorier but not pointlessly the gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline rather than to just get a cheap shriek out of the audience also the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch easily the best work done in a horror film since well ever the work in this film makes savini's effects look like the work of a blind limbless hobo br br the only problem i have with this film is the copious amounts of full frontal nudity which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the composer's goal to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time if it were not for this slight problem i would have given this film a perfect 10
<START> daniel bruno in petites is a middle aged model of his pierre in christian vincent's la separation of 10 years ago in both films youthful confidence in left wing ideology and love mutual metaphors crumbles into paranoia manifesting itself as trapped aggression in pierre and desperately comic womanizing in the more recent bruno br br unfortunately for auteuil fans the actor has become reliant on a uniform world weariness not unlike johnny in recent l'homme du train acting it ain't and becomes rather frustrating as the film progresses pascal doesn't help as the writer director of the project his sequencing of episodes overlaid with connecting symbolism fail to mask the film's lack of rhythm i was particularly furious that the dramatic romantic backdrops of were made virtually redundant by a cameraman who was obviously shivering in the cold br br scott thomas almost rescues the show with her female counterpart to bruno beatrice she dramatizes the dizzying contradictions intended as bruno in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surreal cannot sustain this though and the flagging plot demands beatrice to even out into another bourgeois mannequin in doing so shows then denies scott thomas the oscar cabinet br br all the characters' into the bourgeoisie may be a viable and indeed tragic outcome but in this case it's a cop out of a cadence unlike the brutal painful denouement of la separation a serious disappointment 4 10
<START> the film makers went well out of their way to find only the following demographics palestinians that have the appearance of peace loving solution seeking good will palestinians particularly older women and families with children who are especially inconvenienced by the security fence and israelis that don't believe in the security fence sympathize heavily with its alleged effect on palestinians and consider it unnecessarily divisive and or a waste of money oh yes they do put in one member of the israeli government that does support the fence but they do what they can to portray him as inhumane and uncaring and ask him very leading questions that are really statements e g the wall is bad for the environment it is destroying everything br br i have no problem with any well most of this being presented in the movie however much i may disagree with the people they interview their opinions are valid enough for a documentary however there are at least two sides to the issue of israel's security fence and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of israelis and many others support the construction of the fence and believe it is having an overall positive influence this documentary does not present the opinion of even one such person they even go so far as to interview an israeli jew who claims that all israelis support the fence and are thus insane and then stubbornly refuse to interview even one such crazy israeli oh and to top all this off they set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young israeli children truly exceptions to the rule i've been there that are laughing at about their arab neighbors from across the fence br br a documentary is a film that explores an issue and presents a full array of facts opinions and perspectives unfortunately this is not a documentary this is an unabashed propaganda film that very clearly very pointedly offers a battery of support for only one side of a heavily disputed emotionally and politically charged issue it is no more of a documentary than say fahrenheit 9 11
<START> a variation of the same plot line was used in a simon simon episode thin air that originally aired in dec 1982 br br the gender of the victim was changed the surviving spouse is one of rick's old flames it's also interesting to note that gerald mcraney had a role in this rockford file episode br br both episodes were based on a story by howard browne as noted in the list of 'writing credits' br br anthony james plays one of his classic tv bad guy roles br br the continuation of the concept between the rockford files to magnum pi to simon simon quite interesting
<START> i have been trying to track the age of kings down for many many years my theater life was filled with the actors in this series at the time in 1960 i was not able to follow all of it as i was myself working in the theater lots of night work now in retirement i long to have this and keep it to myself please please can it not be issued on dvd i would not mind what it cost i see that there are others out there who feel the same what can we do to get this done something as great as this should not be sent into oblivion i have to write two more lines ok i can do that by saying that i want this series more than anything in the world just to be able to watch some of the finest actor of our age playing out the finest words of our wonderful shakespeare isn't that enough a
<START> as a south african living in south africa again after a 32 year stay in the uk i am sorry to say that this movie is a huge disappointment the three main problems i had with the movie was a why swank and an american and a to play the leads this country is bursting with talent and has no need of imports b gillian has been trading off her struggle credentials for years now she's a very mediocre writer and even her novel doesn't stand up the flaccid direction of mr hooper and c hilary swank again such a great actor as proved in million dollar baby but that's eastwood too here dressed in the contemporary new york style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director yes the film is ultimately moving how could it not be but the overall mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous letdown heart's in the right place but needs a pace maker
