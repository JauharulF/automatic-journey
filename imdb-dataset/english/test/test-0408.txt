<START> once again woody allen seems to be completely devoid of any inspiration other than recycling himself here we have a mock documentary like zelig the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes radio days broadway danny rose set in the 30's zelig purple rose bullets over broadway about a low life deconstructing harry who believes being a genius him from being a jerk ditto given this film and deconstructing harry one wonders if this is allen's justification for his own actions with mia adopted daughter yes i was a jerk but i'm a genius so you gotta love me br br allen has only produced two good movies in the past ten years the fine but overpraised bullets over broadway and the excellent but largely ignored manhattan murder mystery his other efforts range from trifles new york stories mighty aphrodite to edgy yet experimental husbands and wives to pure drek alice scenes from a mall shadows and fog celebrity deconstructing harry his films no longer even try to have a narrative arc and his humor seems to aim at wryly amusing not funny after deconstructing harry i stopped seeing his films in theaters after sweet and lowdown i may stop renting them as well
<START> simply put the only saving grace this movie has is settings costumes and an ok punk concert how h r giger must feel about his cyborg picture on the cover of this movie i wouldn't like to know right away all i could do was make sardonic comments about the films protagonists i was hoping that the freaks in this movie would execute them in gory fashion i sense spoilers a comin' i was wondering if this film in the spirit of the first 20 min was intended to be as humorously half baked as the rest of it examining all the obvious political police trying to rape a freak the discussion of superficialities between the freak and the frat boy and the punk concert w the female vocalist and the use of slow motion in the fighting sequences which screams martial arts coordinator i just don't know the character named steve irked me since he tries to pick fights w people off the street he shoulda been mugged and raped and looks bad when he broke that guy's neck towards the end want me to show you how to do it i must say this though if they would've developed other characters better than they did splatter this might have gone somewhere if there was a 0 to give this movie it would've got it but alas it's a 1
<START> kite runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books i have read in the recent past i perhaps had very high expectations from the film but none the less the movie was good the entire setting seemed realistic nothing was made to fancy the dialogs were not very attractive or powerful they were just right the movie was not a bad experience at all especially at the last 15mins where it got real emotional and even the hardest man would probably cry but my imagination was far better than the movie i cried more upon reading the novel than seeing the movie but overall a good movie to see for those of u who are not readers but the readers the novel would be a better experience so if at all u want to see the movie read the novel first and then compare it to the movie
<START> i am a big fan of deepa mehta's work especially fire and earth 1947 unfortunately this movie of hers lacks all that is needed for a good film br br the movie attempts to showcase the plight of the widows in india in the early 20th century and the new wave of ideas of their rehabilitation around the same time shown with a child widow as a central character although the plot too banal from an indian standpoint it could still have been a very powerful movie alas the movie lacked both the sensitivity of fire and the intensity of emotion in earth 1947 br br even if one assumes that the story is a given although there are hundreds of things i would have liked different in that as well the movie making is especially unfortunate everything is said everything is shown straight absence of sensitive implied sentences absence of things left unsaid i just couldn't believe that this was a deepa mehta film br br there were some very standard hindi movie characters like an old widow with her own vested interests or a father who has double standards of the highest quality can one not write a script without having these old style standard indian movie characters br br many people acclaimed deepa for making a movie and proving a point against hindu fundamentalists well i agree that she took a bold step but should one not worry about the quality of movie or is it being a controversial one an end in itself its obvious that if you start with a story as in water you will end up feeling the pain of the widows in consideration it doesn't take an accomplished director to achieve that and the movie had nothing more than that so where is contribution to the film br br and talk about acting etc pathetic lisa ray has a pretty face an extremely pretty face but thats where it ends she can't speak hindi she can't emote john abraham is no better most widows seem unnatural the saving grace are seema biswas and the young girl they are fabulous br br and this was a period film but the hindi dialogues suck big time even there utterance is also as unnatural as it gets no rustic accents no local no nothing the only thing right was probably the shooting locales i thought that the set of the ashram was reasonably real the overall blue tinge in the whole movie is also apt br br but all and all don't watch this movie you won't get anything there is nothing in the story or direction if you have to watch it watch it for the little girl's acting
<START> christopher nolan's first directorial effort a year before he did memento and this is almost as brilliant as that classic he uses time in a similar manner to tell his story and it's a very clever one br br bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about one day he follows this man cobb who turns the tables and confronts bill who breaks down and confesses what he's up to br br cobb is a burglar and he takes bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them br br but there's an ulterior motive for cobb nurturing this relationship and it all ties in very smartly at the end no i won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and i'm beginning to think christopher nolan is a genius br br if you like suspense films with surprise endings this one is a must see
<START> another example that we should stay away from trying to do spectacular action movies in sweden it doesnÂ´t work except for still unsurpassed stormare does the best he can i suppose and some scenes are mildly effective but the plot is full of holes why does hamilton continue the attack on the base knowing that his wife is held hostage it was fun to see mark hamill but his bad guy part was very underwritten iÂ´m constantly amazed that relatively big swedish movies like this get made without a sensible functioning script 1 out of 5
<START> the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such 'taboo' subjects such as paedophilia the set the suits the smug presenters the men at the scene shouting about things you can see behind them the pointless cgi and stats the whole thing was a satire a very very funny satire the way c list celebrity's will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it'll be good for their career there is no evidence for it but it is scientific fact it may be hard to watch with milly and the girls as well as 9 11 but satire is supposed to be challenging and we shouldn't be afraid to stand up against the blatant and headline grabbing media just because it's a delicate matter how this show failed to win any tv awards for it's intelligence observation courage acting and thought provocation is shameful but as watching it will show you not in the least bit surprising
<START> i came across this movie while channel surfing one day and decided to give it a chance to my surprise i enjoyed this movie i felt some genuine chemistry between cates and malcolm jamal warner it was such a lighthearted and warm movie that when it was over i felt upbeat sure this movie was predictable from the very beginning but i give it high marks for the way that it made me feel when it was over i must admit that i have never seen cates before but i feel that she can definitely act when you combine her good acting with her cute face and attractive figure she has the makings of at least becoming a well known star
<START> by far this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life i watch practically every movie that is on at night either showtime hbo cinemax etc three aka survivor island keeps you in as much suspense as watching paint dry only to let you down even more miserably if you want to feel like you just wasted what seems like an eternity on the worst film ever created then by all means watch this movie i must have screamed at a minimum 900 times from the idiotic twists if i had 4 hands i'd give this movie 4 thumbs down br br in my personal opinion i believe the only people who would like this movie are those with terrible morals
<START> a very carelessly written film poor character and idea development the silly plot and weak acting by just about the ensemble cast didn't help seriously watching this movie will not make you smile it may make you retch
<START> this film is a very descent remake of the famous fritz lang's masterpiece m murder it is well made and with a entertaining key to speak about pretty serious events and contemporary problems in but not only the whole world the ethnic intolerance is such a huge evil and very nowadays so children of wax or as it is known in us distribution reveals the question of german and hatred in an amusing way no doubt it is well appreciated to be taken for distribution by the great brothers and there is another fact i liked most is the participation in this movie of the favorite actor of lars von trier the great udo kier who shows to play with such a pleasure for the bulgarian film director ivan
<START> with some wine some friends and some good humor i had a really good time watching this film i particularly enjoyed the performance of as randy who was such a kick in the pants his scenes with charity michelle were wildly amusing i wouldn't want him coming on to me but it was great watching randy try to score with michelle and even better seeing the results of course the girls in the film are lots of fun to watch too and a friend of mine showed me the playboy issue that had pilar as the playmate of the month she's definitely a looker all in all this film totally served its purpose which was to entertain us in a light and care free way
<START> we loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat not your usual hollywood drivel br br my husband had a blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent hollywood stuff he was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance there was only one copy and with some glitches in the dvd that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling but it was worth it cathy bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role and she can sing too br br if only hollywood would learn from independent film makers maybe we would go back to the real movies but for now we're sticking with off beat and really entertaining films like this one other examples we've enjoyed include a box full of moonlight pieces of april delivering milo the celestine prophesy most of the ones by christopher guest such as best in show for your consideration a mighty wind and waiting for guffman
<START> this movie was one of the best i have ever seen just the other day i was reminded of this movie by something on tv it came back to me like a dam flooding over i have never been more touched by a movie than by this one after the movie was over i actually could not quit crying for about 2 hours no movie has ever moved me that way before i was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping i can find a copy to buy so that i can watch it whenever i want to if someone suggests you see this movie with them go you will not be disappointed br br peggy fries
<START> i can't believe i'm wasting my time with a comment but this movie is weirdly bad if 20 different directors were brought in to film different parts of the movie without having any idea of the storyline being filmed by the other directors this is pretty much the result i would expect br br i also think some of the scenes were spliced out of order things don't always seem to progress in order the movie acts like we're already supposed to know about half the characters br br and steve guttenberg tries to do manic a la robin williams comedy in this movie ewww and the whole premise of putting an ex con in charge of a bunch of kids just doesn't seem realistic in this day and age
