<START> this movie is funny in more ways than one it's got action it's got humour it's got attitude it's got dolemite's all girl army of kung fu and that's just what the movie offers as a film it's also badly acted by some the mic makes more than one cameo appearance and some punches miss by feet but when you make a movie this cool who's got time to pay attention to those details this movie rocks rent it tonight if you can find it i had to buy it to see it but i don't regret it
<START> cowardly and cynical the represents the nadir of paddy special brand of celebration of the status quo disguised as satire br br thanks to ham handed director arthur hiller this ludicrous script gets the visually ugly poorly paced presentation it deserves br br only a great performance by george c scott in the sort of mean spirited role he was born to play keeps the from being a complete disaster br br ironically though scott's performance does viewers a disservice his magnetism keeps them watching when they might more turn off the vcr and clean out the closets stare at the clouds or watch re runs of baywatch ' br br certainly anyone who emotionally invests in the set up modern medicine apparently gone amok will feel cheated by the dismal payoff where reveals that the system works just fine so quit your carping br br while the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy it all turns out to be a red herring before that becomes clear though gives some good lines to scott as his middle aged middle class white male stand in br br bitter alcoholic impotent scott's dr herbert has alienated those who know him best and he has the bile to keep alienating them in worldview all that of course makes a magnet for a hippie chick half his age br br playing a collection of adjectives the long haired long legged and almost bust less diana rigg struggles in the part of the girl ' the british rigg is miscast as a southwestern free spirit but any other actress would struggle as well like the rest of a good cast gone to waste rigg can't overcome a script that isn't interested in any character except or any philosophy beyond banality br br for fans of george c scott this is another star turn and worth watching for fans of black comedy turn it off after the first 45 minutes for anyone else don't bother
<START> maybe this wowed them in the 50's but this is one of those flicks that doesn't age well it's got that preachy earnest downtrodden working man vibe of a 2nd rate rod serling live tv playhouse broadcast the plot is by the book the cassevetes character's troubled background seems tacked on and the love interest is unconvincing and half hearted br br sidney gives an ok performance but man he sure was an annoying haughty snot if i had to work with this guy in a warehouse i'd probably want to hit him with a grappling hook too jack warden is good because as usual he plays jack warden br br like 90 of the films rated on imdb whether they are classics mediocre or crapola somehow this one gets rated with 7 point some stars it is in no way deserving of that save your time
<START> i am almost a two decade old human who's been reading comics most of my life i'm not a huge fan of the fantastic four but i'm fairly familiar with them in 1994 roger corman b movie legend produced the first i think feature length fantastic four film the result was such pure schlock that it was never given a release still copies exist mostly on the net and at conventions if you're looking for a laugh and can find a copy do yourself a favor and check this thing out br br the film basically retells the origin and an encounter with doctor doom and a villain named the essentially the mole man with a penchant for petty larceny as is the case with these comic book movies everything has to tie into everything so the ff play a vital role in dr doom's creation and he and the play a vital role in theirs br br first i'd just like to mention that despite everything that went bad in this movie i actually sort of liked the guy that played doom he doesn't get many decent lines but when he does he hits them the armor looks pretty good too br br as for the rest it's a dirty dirty mess bad plots bad acting bad effects bad everything basically boos especially to jay underwood bringing new meaning to the word overacting as johnny storm he's not overacting he's br br as for the ff well they all sort of look right and sue's played by a very attractive actress but they just don't seem like a real team for one thing they have no reason for sue and johnny to go into space in an early section ben and reed go to visit the two johnny's like 8 and sue's about 12 it only stands to make their eventual romantic pairing a helluva lot creepier the thing costume looks more reptilian than anything else not very rocky and the only time the human torch is really a human torch he looks like the silver surfer tinted red br br i could type for hours but i think the scene that best sums it up is a climactic encounter featuring the aforementioned not so human torch he's racing a laser beam and he eventually destroys it with a punch yes a punch a laser beam with a punch then he flies around and goes a whole lot whereupon the camera tilts down and he flies back toward earth evidently reed the intellectual forgot to inform johnny that fire doesn't exist in the vacuum of space this and many other scenes operate like looney if the character doesn't know they are over a cliff they don't fall br br i laughed i cried i was glad it was never released
<START> this all but ignored masterpiece is about the monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie head and that everything they do or say had already been written in an unseen script they seem to be following head was written by jack nicholson and peter during a three day lsd trip in a suite at an expensive hollywood hotel the other three monkees only acted in it br br they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script they deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge br br for instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch frame by frame you can see sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror he is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells cut br br the monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are that ends up being the core of the revelation soon to come br br at every turn they realize their increasingly bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they can't escape being in you say they went crazy and walked through the sky which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the set's background no problem hey hey they're the monkees and those wacky guys just keep around br br in the end even their deaths did not set them free that was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production br br this is made all the more poignant by the fact that the monkees really are fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world they did it through the power of their music br br ironically near the end peter has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens br br peter realizes it doesn't matter if we're in the box the film he means that it doesn't matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur you need to just let happen as it happens without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid by some abstract definition br br when you can't even tell the difference will being free or not doesn't matter tying to figure out if you are the real you is just a pointless waste of time br br i saw this film at a very important time in my life i was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun i e sex like everyone else did but the revelation in head broke my self imposed recursive trap and helped me more than or nicholson or will ever know br br for decades i've watched head and wished i could thank pete br br was this a good movie br br uhh how about like br br yes
<START> i saw this movie in the early 1990's when it had been out on vhs for a little while at the time i found it to be interesting and was especially struck by the ken russell segment with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgery br br last night at a 2nd run showing of the latest indiana jones movie the vision of john hurt prompted an unexpected flashback to aria which i had not thought of in years and the sudden memory of the russell piece itself was enough to cause an outbreak of tears for a little bit br br if i can make this observation i note with interest the love hate reaction that people have expressed to the russell segment and i have found this interesting difference in other movies that delve into deep trauma and its aftereffects some get it others do not interesting br br i see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways this is how it affected and affects me
<START> this was a rather unnerving look at an ostensibly functional family confronted by their daughter's druggie boyfriend father tangles with and ultimately kills druggie boyfriend wallowing in guilt he reveals to a drunk redneck what he has done things spiral rapidly out of hand before degenerating completely the ending you dread stalks the viewer throughout but is still able to startle when it finally arrives

<START> maverick director seijun suzuki finally was able to film his dream project princess raccoon and in a way it's lucky he didn't try this in the 1960's special effects and computer graphics certain made this sort of production easier to achieve than the old film matte technology would have br br some familiarity with japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film much as familiarity with shakespeare's the tempest would help with peter greenaway's dense prospero's books these two films actually have a bit in common although princess raccoon is much more colorful and easier to watch for someone without the background to fully appreciate it br br while the art design acting and direction are fine for most of the film it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the last third of the film most of the interesting sets have been already been introduced and the camera seems to step back for more of a filmed stage play experience br br this is certainly a unique film experience and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in alternate forms of film performance it's not really meant for children although nothing happens that would upset them if the last third was better i would have given it nine stars
<START> dire beyond belief obviously set on the isle of man masquerading as the us very badly and full of cut rate british actors who can't do american accents a monster that looks like an promotional cut out for alien from a movie store with the most inflexible feet ever seen girls in the shower undressing blah blah blah you get the idea don't watch it run away hide avoid
<START> robin williams is a national treasure specially when he cuts loose and puts aside his maudlin approach to drama he manages to liven up the usual restrained pacing of barry levinson and there are moments in this film when he truly shines br br as the funny elected american president in man of the year williams recaptures the hilarity and outrageousness that used to be associated with him what makes him so appealing is his humanity and likability here is a man who can lash at his audience but truly loves them too his humour is like barbed wire and yet it is cathartic it is what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life br br laura linney is once again portraying an intelligent woman in distress she is a fabulous and very talented performer but i think she has boxed into a stereotype and unfortunately it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case walken pretty much walks through his thankless role and the climatic scene in the snl skit barely floats above water br br go in for a few hilarious moments and those are priceless enjoy williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie
<START> i have to say that this movie was not what i expected even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of 3000 years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit this is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most but not a crocodile either way this film was like that it entices you to think about ruins of mayan or inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd as for this movie it will hit the 'b' list in no time i have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see but it didn't make up for the rest of the film and a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder
<START> a compact crime drama with a good amount of action the unique nyc location shots adds to this tough little film technically well done with good direction and acting needless to say the wild car chase that seems to begin in downtown extends through the upper west side washington heights across the george washington bridge and into nj has to be one of the best ever on film all around a fine flick that for me gets better with time 8 out of 10 easy
<START> that's right we've got a 2008 film using themes of brief encounter and the bridges of madison county it's basically the story of lost loves redemption and a triumph of the human spirit br br the performances by richard gere and especially diane lane are very good gere gives the kind of restrained performance here as a doctor who is searching for meaning after a patient dies on the operating table lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a nice young son who has split from her wandering husband and has also sustained the loss of her father in the same year br br scott glenn steals the show in a one scene meeting with gere he is the heartbroken husband and he recounts his love to his departed wife it will bring tears to your eyes br br fresh from her triumph as an mother in doubt viola davis appears as an understanding friend in the film and literally hangs her hair down in a rather benign performance
<START> to answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the u s official mentioned in the name of the character is mr carlucci frank carlucci is reported as having been at that time second secretary at the u s embassy in the congo subsequently among other assignments he was appointed u s ambassador to portugal deputy director of the central intelligence agency secretary of defense and is now the chairman of the carlyle group it's hardly surprising that biographical sketch on his www com web site fails to credit his service in the belgian congo if his name was deliberately censored from the hbo version of it may have been to avoid the possibility of hbo's being sued in u s courts name however is clearly mentioned in the theatre version of that i saw recently in the event i expect that he would deny any involvement in murder br br others have commented on the evenhandedness with which the film treats the parties concerned supporters other even belgians a somewhat more sinister view emerges i think from the bbc documentary entitled who killed based on the book the murder of by belgian historian de witte when examined closely these films demonstrate that the fate of and the history of the congo is not just a matter of black and white only murderers believe that
