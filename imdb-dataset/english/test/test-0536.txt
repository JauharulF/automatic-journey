<START> tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his old lady owner in the same baggage car also in a cage is sylvester br br in no time sylvester has grabbed tweety but a comes back and slaps the feline as he calls him back in his cage he puts tweety in a safer place up high and tells the cat now remember no tricks sylvester puts his halo on and looks innocent yeah right br br i found the funniest stuff however didn't involve sylvester versus tweety but the dog that is in another cage next to sylvester the cat gets mouthy with him and pays a big price in an extremely funny manner sylvester just doesn't learn but that's one reason we love him i know a number of imdb reviewers don't like tweety but i like both main characters they both crack me up br br also the train and the passing scenery is beautifully illustrated in here really nice visuals
<START> the end of suburbia is a very useful film it's also important and provocative there seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment the anti sprawl meister james howard br br while i am not a big fan of the new my criticism of it is because of its small vision in the case of new peter another talking head you finally hear what's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added out takes just doesn't understand peak oil br br i've used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production a fact long diminished by economics and also as a vehicle for educating about peak oil our wastrel land use global warming our threatened food production public transit our compromised future br br move over south park made by canadians from toronto for 25 000 and released in may 2004 this video sold over 24 000 copies by october 2005 one major dvd rental vendor recently ordered almost 400 more copies br br the end of suburbia sales were actually climbing 1 1 2 years after its release and it has also been available on one of the major online video services since september 2005 br br a sequel escape from suburbia is in the works with a possible release by august 2006
<START> over the last few months i have seen a lot of reviews for the italian job many of them negative the gist of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that for all its modernistic bravado and high budget technology the film doesn't have much substance where it counts look people it's just a fun movie this is the type of picture where you're supposed to sit back relax and just enjoy the steady moving pace of the film like ocean's eleven 2001 you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking lucky for some of us granted ocean is a better movie but who cares the plot may have some holes there's a huge one about 3 4 of the way through the action may not be as gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be and some of the dialogue may seem pointless and cheesy but again who really cares cool characters mini coopers big explosions charlize theron what more do you want i think it's time to drop the fake roger ebert meets gene act and enjoy yourself for once oh and another thing whatever you do don't compare it to the original because to reiterate what f gary gray has told the press a million times this is not a remake my advice if you're interested in nit picking your way through a good humored fun flick don't even bother seeing the italian job but if you don't have a severe inferiority complex and or want to see ed norton get jacked by a bunch of go ahead the bottom line my fellow moviegoers is lighten up and have fun dammit
<START> okay if you discount the production value the ugly outfits and the big hair this adaptation is still far inferior to the 90's version first ann playing anne elliot is literally ten years too old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired amanda root playing the same role in the 90's version can express more in her big brown eyes than can with her entire face in a four hour production anne is turned into a peevish whining boring character and what was with the scene during the long where she stops to spout off poetry henrietta and louisa looked so much alike that the only time i could tell them apart was when they stood next to each other henrietta was taller and louisa never was there a more obnoxious character it was ridiculous to think that wentworth was supposed to be interested in her she is supposed to be high spirited and pretty and charming not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that's like nails on a chalkboard when she starts to chant to to to ' i started yelling shut up shut up shut up ' the best part of the movie was when louisa falls those three feet at the cobb because i knew i wouldn't have to see her anymore in the movie speaking of the fall at the cobb scene it was the poorly acted badly directed and edited scene of the entire film how does a person fall three feet down land on her feet and still be knocked unconscious br br on the plus size the character of elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90's version they also put in many more scenes with anne and frederick at the end br br i'll admit i have bought this movie even though i knew how sub par it was but i'm a huge austen fan so i'll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels watch this move if you're morbidly curious or to appreciate the 90's version even more br br the bottom line is this version may follow the letter of the novel but the 90's version follows the spirit
<START> this is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production martha coolidge herself said she only had 350 000 dollars to work with this is a movie that i loved growing up in the midwest i remember friends and i having the nostalgia trip on this movie 10 years ago great things about this movie great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director bad points of this movie to small of a budget calling for way too much improvisation if martha coolidge had been given more money and time on this movie then the results would of been even better they should have taken the story from an early 20's prospective and not from a 15 17 year old high school stand point most of the actors actresses were in their early to mid 20's trying to play 15 17 year olds come on the music is extremely memorable and the two soundtracks get played all the time in my car the best scenes in this film take place in seedy hollywood clubs by nicolas cage's character i gave this film a high rating of 9 10 for five reasons nicholas cage's improvisational on the spot acting the camera work and angles are excellent given the budget they had and only being able to have one take of each scene the music and lingo are captured perfectly and forever again the music is incredible and carries the story along from scene to scene and finally martha coolidge could turn a weak script unknown actors and a very very low budget and 20 days of shooting the entire movie into such a good and memorable movie is astounding
<START> this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever see yet once i started it was just like the really bad car wreck on the side of the road you can't help yourself you just have to look my eyes the acting was awful the production was awful the filming was awful awful awful awful i was glad the priest got chopped would have loved to have done it myself because of his poor acting i mean suck acting to the tenth power i would have cheered if chris had just axed the lot of them before turning it on himself and what was with that freaking wig from hell on his head i sincerely hope no one got paid i mean if getting paid were to be considered here they should be paid to never attempt another film project again everyone that was involved never never again that was just a huge piece of garbage that i am embarrassed to say i just had to keep watching until the very end don't watch it it's about an hour and a half of your life you will never get back and then you'll have to spend time registering on this website so you can write a comment like i am doing now which you must do as a catharsis in order to survive the of having viewed this film and i use the term film loosely here
<START> don't be fooled by the plot out line as it is described on the cover at least the swedish version the story on this seems rather interesting with speculative hints nothing can be further from the truth this is the absolute most sad movie experience i've ever had it is plain and right awful and should not be sold or rented to anyone if you still think the plot seems intriguing reflect on this telephones can move run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance it can throw things at you haunt you and run after you please do not watch this movie it is a disgrace for the horror genre
<START> let's see this movie is many things to different people to finns as shown by the comments it can be ok or dreadful or boring to other folks it can be something different first off if you do not speak finnish i do you will understand half of what is going on as subtitles are dreadful and even the title is translated incorrectly maa would probably be translated as badlands in uk english br br why did i not like it because it is a tarantino style movie it simply takes a very harsh reality and throws it back at you as brutally as possible i however am not american and thus i am not particularly fond of this proceeding because all it does is show that the director has really nothing new to say technical prowess camera work is brilliant script not that unoriginal do not rescue this movie from the bottom where it belongs should you wish to see a finnish movie then go for any of the brothers' movie who match talent and directorial skill with very good actresses and actors br br this director ought to review his intention and priorities none was intelligible and thus this film failed by not watching it you won't miss much
<START> man i remember this show with nostalgic i really dug because he wasn't the conventional hero he was more than a futuristic texas cowboy the man had the strenght of a bear the vision of a walk and the agility of a i can't remember that one br br the action sequences were great i remember that would always use his bazooka named translated to spanish anytime he was in big troubles br br this was a quality action cartoon i loved the characters the dialogs the music and of course the opening credits sequence long live to him a cult classic in my opinion and a must see
<START> the 3 stars are for phillip seymour hoffman nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a wee smidgen of a star well ok amy adams deserves a wee smidgen but the doesn't seem to be working so i'll stick with 3 tom hanks nothing julia roberts nothing mike nichols do you see a trend yet aaron omg not a chance br br i could rant on for several paragraphs about the way charlie wilson's war glosses over history morality legitimacy and so on but i don't think any such rant could outweigh the gushing of aaron fans the rest of you beware spend your movie money elsewhere br br still if you're looking for a pithy comment here's mine you can put hot fudge sauce on a pile of garbage but it changes nothing garbage is garbage and so is charlie wilson's war
<START> karen and her boyfriend jerry move into their new los angeles apartment they discover an old brass bed that karen takes a liking to unfortunately it has a really sinister history involving kinky sex murders deathbed tries to be a creepy supernatural tale but fails miserably the action is slow the acting is nothing special and there is no suspense whatsoever even the sex scenes are lame the climax is pretty gory and violent so fans of splatter should be pleased however the first hour of deathbed is deadly dull and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scares definitely one to avoid my rating 4 out of 10 and that's being generous watch re animator or castle freak instead
<START> i would recommend this for anyone who is an admirer of the late john cassavetes and for those who have never known of cassavetes it is an excellent film i really don't have the time to go into the details of why this is my opinion but if you're looking for something gutsy with lots of scenes to mull over then this one is for you the cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film as well as the story itself this review does not do the film justice it is an experience one must view for themselves lots of character very genuine
<START> this is one of the worst films i've ever seen don't watch it even if your life depends on it br br this laurel and hardy film is when they inherit an island become shipwrecked and are set to be hung an incredibly boring film that is no where near funny br br this was the last laurel and hardy film and what a very low note to end such a superb career the 40's films weren't great this film was made in 1950 if you want to remember laurel and hardy remember them in their prime the 1930's the short talking films are better than the feature length films my favourite is me and my pal another reason this film is awful is because it's dubbed the actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later crap but let's end on a high note laurel and hardy have been in my opinion the best double act ever
<START> slaughter trail is a b western with some grand pretensions but it's come down in hollywood history for a most ignominious reason br br watching this film with it's musical score which can only be described as overbearing i have a feeling what howard hughes was trying to do is recruit a singing cowboy for rko films they already had tim holt who was as reliable a b picture cowboy hero there ever was but he was not a singer i guess hughes saw what money herbert j yates was raking in with roy rogers over at republic and decided he'd get one as well br br so terry who was a very good performer and much better song writer got recruited and sang some of his material which was not his best and worse looked like they were shoehorned into the picture but worse than that there's this annoying chorus which sang a lot of the story and frankly overwhelmed the actors extras even the horses needless to say terry never got to be a singing cowboy but he did write such classics as the bare necessities and dean martin's great hit memories are made of this br br the plot concerns an inside woman on a stagecoach jewel robbery that's right the outlaws who are gig young myron healey and ken plant virginia grey in the coach as a passenger which they receive word is carrying some valuable jewels br br it's a great act grey and young pull off young takes her away from the coach to presumably a fate worse than death and they do properly act out the scene within earshot of the passengers but what he does is slip her the swag last place the authorities might look if she doesn't run off with it br br but when they flee the robbery it's on tired horses so they stop at a cabin to take some replacement mounts and shoot three navajos who object that puts the navajos back on the warpath didn't help that one of the casualties was chief ric roman's brother br br that's the situation that captain brian donlevy at the fort has to deal with when the coach and the outlaws arrive there for protection how it all works out is predictable but in a gaudy sort of overproduced way br br in fact that's the problem with slaughter trail it's a simple no frills b western that got souped up into something almost grotesque br br but the real reason slaughter trail entered into history is that this film apparently marks the official beginning of the blacklist originally howard dasilva was to play part and may have in fact completed his scenes when howard hughes officially fired him for communist sympathies his scenes were completely re shot with brian donlevy in the lead br br considering what a fiasco this film turned into i'm not sure whether donlevy or dasilva ought to have thanked hughes or kicked him in his private preserve
<START> i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat plus i still think bryan brown is the tops brilliant film
