<START> this movie is like so many biopic tv movies i have seen formulaic exaggerating poorly acted and most importantly happening too soon br br what i mean by that is the movie was filmed and for that matter aired before michael jackson's acquittal from his child molestation charges which i think was one of the most significant periods of jackson's life and career so far it probably would have made a great ending to this docu drama however this movie already bites off more than it can chew cramming too many details in this overly ambitious project br br it's no doubt that michael jackson has led perhaps the most interesting life so far of any musician let alone modern day pop star to date and his story would probably take six behind the music specials to tell accurately this movie tried to tell too much in three hours and needless to say it failed br br flex alexander did what he could in playing jackson but he came off more like an snl caricature by the likes of tim meadows and amy poehler it would admittedly be pretty hard to find someone who accurately portrays jackson without meeting with the king of pop himself and studying his methods of madness on a shoestring budget though one can only depend on what they see in the tabloids and those do not necessarily give an accurate representation br br furthermore the director's efforts to make alexander look like jackson are completely foolish the caucasian makeup on alexander's face makes him look more like a reverse minstrel show and everyone who has been in a grocery store knows that jackson's nose is not as big as alexander's it's also amazing to me that the film documents jackson going under the knife to get cosmetic surgery yet in the next scene alexander still has the same size nose this kind of suspension of disbelief that the director expects can't hold up to tv viewers in the 21st century br br it was even more distracting when footage of the real michael jackson i e the time he hung his infant child over a balcony in germany was interspersed into the movie in real time it was a nice try but it just didn't work br br if this movie as it is was released into theaters it would gain a profit only because of its tackiness it even pales in comparison to mommie dearest and that's saying a lot above all this was a movie that was probably rushed into making like many tv movies that aren't on hbo it could have been done a lot better if it had just told of one aspect of jackson's life even if it just covered the child molestation allegations it probably would have been done a lot better and would have even been more intriguing
<START> a fantastic cinema experience i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out there is nothing to add except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still isn't accepted by the ampas american academy after roles in such films as tom jones murder on the orient express under the volcano to name only few for these he was nominated for the oscar the dresser is arguably his highlight yet br br i know oscars are just popularity contest but if americans like british actors and actresses and the oscar goes to jeremy irons daniel day lewis anthony hopkins emma thompson glenda jackson etc and they all deserved the award why they always left sir finney with empty hands br br on the other hand they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei in cousin vinny i don't know should i laugh or cry br br if you have seen the two leads in the dresser you won't forget what is the art of acting watch this film and enjoy i recommend it to everyone who loves art br br i give 9 10 for this excellent film 1 point missing for non cinematic material after all it is just a theater br br note my criteria is much stronger than this on imdb 10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should could last forever
<START> it takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it o brother does that and then some the first time i saw it i have to admit i had never seen anything like it then i wanted to see it again and now i'm up to double digits with this great movie the coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done with fargo and hudsucker proxy coming in a tight second and third for me br br george clooney gives the performance of his career playing ulysses everett mcgee a fast talking know it all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all tim blake nelson and john turturro are the perfect sidekicks for clooney particularly nelson and his portrayal of delmar a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee john goodman is my favorite bit character as big dan perfect it reminds me of his part in raising arizona he's just a perfect actor for this role coen brothers' favorites holly hunter and charles durning also provide memorable performances br br joel and ethan coen are masters of their trade it's not like they try to win academy awards every time they make a film they just try and tell a story that they want to tell and it's entertaining it's a loose adaptation of the odyssey and i mean loose for all of you homer fanatics it's just great br br the most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring i've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and i am still in awe just thinking about it the coloring does become an important part of the movie great great movie
<START> first of all no one with any law enforcement experience not er or but real law enforcement takes this show seriously walker would be drummed out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics on top of that he is a comic book character no acting ability incredibly trite lines no character development the fact that alex cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are and is the ultimate clown in black face come on if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias then explain why jt is treated as a dolt always is the subject of walker's jokes never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime and never rescues walker who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them and believe me most cops are dumber than dirt the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured the jerk needs to be put of his misery but then again norris produced the show as well as starred in it so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time what a terrible series it is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger roy rogers the cisco kid and wild bill hickock though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows but like those shows in the same way as those shows walker tr is just as insulting and just plain silly
<START> if you have been to the east of europe or even in their armed forces you might find this movie interesting i don't know why calls this a comedy sure there are a few funny moments but it is not a good movie if one of the orderly officers talks for 15 min about the achievements of socialism on a christmas dinner and the officers in general act like funny oafs the soldiers are running of the base to meet their girls at night and surprise surprise one of the girls is the daughter of the commander the east german army was known for its abusive and humiliating service of its conscripted men and the comedy was basically not filmed on the facilities or with the equipment to make a good movie of the east german army and their time now gone by despite this some of the actors and actresses tried to act well but it came out only in the roles they're known for from east german tv and some small films i would not recommend this movie to anybody it was basically boring and very cheap made
<START> its been years since i have seen these shows i have been searching years for anyone else that has seen these or know anything about them i thought i made them up the one i remember most is the soldier and death i'd ask movie fanatics if they had seen these mentioning its a jim henson and people still didn't know these are great fables i was very young when i was these not even 10 and it left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs i would recommend anyone to watch these just remember they are from the 80's so they don't look like the movies today just give them a shot jim henson was way ahead of his time and died to early
<START> i had already heard of ali g in madonna's music video music i always think he's funny in fact he really is just last year i always thought of buying a vcd of ali g that's why some months later i bought it cheap and i started watching it br br but the movie surprised me my older brother and i were expecting it to be a great laugh out comedy it turns out that is just a stupid piece of garbage it was really really bad it also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor it also didn't made me laugh even just a big smile we definitely hate that movie oh by the way i have plans to sell it br br ali g was really different in his movie compared to his tv shows in such a negative way maybe he wasn't really well focused and enough serious to make this flick just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious because sometimes too much isn't that laughable anymore for the first time ever i was disappointed at him that really made me sad rather and happy br br i gave this movie 1 over 10 actually i really want to give it a 0 rating it's one of the worst movies i've seen in my entire life i wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible
<START> all i can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters this is city of god meets happy days the of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a diaper commercial is completely unconvincing you can approach it in one of two ways 1 a gritty realistic movie turned sappy or 2 a sappy abc afterschool special with profanity violence and animal cruelty either way it just don't fly do it why then has it received so much praise as others have implied it gets the conscience vote from the west show us pictures of poverty to contrast against our fluffy double wide theatre seats and 44 oz cokes and we'll applaud in a heartbeat but oh don't forget to candy coat it because the bitter pill of reality tantalizing as it is is hard for us to swallow br br i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there all i can say is beware of any film that receives awards hollywood oscars sweeping syrupy tripe cannes film festival beard stroking artless propaganda to find the real gems you'll have to work hard at it
<START> i know the girl who did the figure skating for the lead girl she once dated my brother and she was always really nice i also live in b c about 15 or so minutes from fort steele haha i used to go there for field trips when i was in elementary school it was kinda weird seeing it in the movie i also had the chance when the movie was filming to be an extra because there was a casting call for them at the mall but i didn't feel like going to it at the time because i wasn't interested in acting now i totally wish i did this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay it never came out here which is kind of weird seeing it was partially filmed here so i was excited when it came i really loved the story line and the bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away
<START> i get really fed up with sitcoms you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny on the other hand hi de hi you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny i have just purchased the second set of the series series 3 4 and i am surprised at just how much i am enjoying it all again i have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors or the many unseen crew members because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait the gems that have come from this series and the respect that the actors achieved through it speak for themselves croft and perry created some pure gold some of which shines through hi de hi
<START> this an extremely horrible movie and if your thinking you've seen another horrible movie exactly like this one before you probably have you probably saw scarecrow 2 made in 2003 yes thats what i said brian the director stole the movie idea and not only did he steal it he actually might have been able to make it worse i bet the even the actors were scared to tell people they were actually in the movie also i have to mention that the director was trying to make up for the cheesiness by showing as much tits as possible also the kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie in fact that is probably all that the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent movie which will never work
<START> i went to see glenn i sell the dead in it's north american premiere at the toronto after dark film festival seeing as this is the second showing worldwide i didn't quite know what to expect of this film especially having not seen the short film that inspired this big screen adaptation br br i'll start off with a slightly more elaborate plot synopsis without giving away any spoilers br br this movie is about arthur blake how he became a grave robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries that both he and his mentor discovered br br the costume and set design in this film were excellent i was amazed to hear that the entire film was shot in and around new york the costumes were very accurate to the time really bringing you as a viewer into the mindset of the time this movie works just as well as a period piece as it does a horror comedy br br the interaction between the two leads was very fluid they played off each others acting with ease the dialogue between the two was very well written with glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations br br the story is very encompassing and the ball gets rolling from the very start i'd compare it to a visual page turner always wondering just what will happen next the characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself br br all in all i recommend this film for anyone in the mood for some dark humour with a bit of horror mixed in br br 9 10
<START> a friend of mine who is even more into 1970s cult films than myself recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that i watched however i was not as enthusiastic about the result as he Â or for that matter michael elliott Â was the film is a hybrid of house of wax 1953 and the texas chain saw massacre 1974 indeed i would venture to say that it served as the basis of the 2005 remake of the former much more than the 'original' did so we have a remote and derelict wax museum of incredibly lifelike dummies guess why that is with its apparently harmless curator a hammy chuck connors being by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers among them tanya roberts he also has a mad brother Â shades of psycho 1960 incorporated for good measure down to the self same twist Â who is supposed to be a mechanical genius showcased in a 'poltergeist' which unaccountably accompanies the first murder the film does benefit from a pino donaggio score but being so derivative and not especially well made to boot essentially ends up merely a redundant and fairly muddled genre effort
<START> a quite easy to watch tale of 2 thieves with that love hate type relationship between them walken stars and is very good as the silent rogue with a scam bigger than he's letting on
<START> i had high hopes for this movie i even gave up a night of watching stargate for this movie i found it had a rushed feel about it and a lot of the key biblical moments and facts were missing i might be a bit jaded and spoiled for the 1956 version as i have watched that one every year for the last 20 or so years i doubt this one will make it to the realm of yearly classic as the other one has if you have not seen the version you might like this one but i seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one this has some nifty special effects but that is not what i look for when telling a movie like the ten commandments i was kind of looking to see how they told the story and the writers did not do a good job with this one
