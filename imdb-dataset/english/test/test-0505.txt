<START> mickey rourke who was once a famous movie star plays martin fallon an ira terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the ira and goes on the run in london br br mild spoilers br br the movie's opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in northern ireland which gives a prayer for the dying a stark realism however as soon as fallon decides he's going to give up violence what he's a terrorist and he's never blown up innocent before realism disappears and clichÃ©s and ridiculous plot twists take place martin is employed by the london underworld don't they have their own hit men to commit a hit while he wears an ira uniform never knew the wore uniforms at a cemetery in broad daylight wouldn't an ira man use a bomb placed under a car where he's spotted by a priest who recognises him while he was in the sas hands up who thinks i'm lying i'm not and we're half way through the running time and there's still several clichÃ©s to come br br this all sounds very silly and it is but what do you expect from a novel by jack higgins everything is clichÃ©d contrived and stereotypical and the bits that aren't are just plain bizarre the critics slaughtered this movie when it came out most notably they stated that it might have some potential if the movie had bob hoskins playing gangster jack and alan bates playing the sas soldier turned priest and for once the critics would have been right they should also noted the film might have been less dire if fallon was played by someone who was capable of doing an irish accent rourke might be hunky and macho oh gawd another movie with an ira but accents aren't his strong point any more than character acting is to give you an idea how disappointing prayer for the dying is the director ended up disowning it which is always a bad sign br br as a footnote the original release of prayer for the dying in britain was delayed for several months because of the bombing in november 1987 the provisional ira exploded a bomb in the centre of where a remembrance day parade which britain's war dead was being held eleven 11 people were killed and scores more injured it wasn't an accident and no one left the ira because of it
<START> the film begins with a 30 minute explanation about the war the human cyborgs battles history and then dumps 2 actors into a gravel pit they run around this gravel pit desert area for about an hour shooting at each other that's it must have cost about Â£10 00 to make with change avoid br br marks out of ten acting 9 sets 1 costumes 9 direction 50 production 1 titled intro 4 br br i think to improve this film would be to lose the commentary let the watcher decide what's going on remove some of the awful cgi add some techno rave music to it they might just rescue it
<START> i was really disappointed by this movie great actors in it and potentially a great plot but it just seemed to limp along br br charlize theron was masterful in her role and beautiful but it seemed like 90 of her on screen work was in car chases done with austin minis product placement gone wrong so very wrong br br the direction seemed off too edward norton is the bad guy and it was so obvious right from the start every time the camera would pass over him it would linger too long and norton would grimace or something c'mon hollywood give us a little credit it's okay to surprise us with a plot twist without having to telegraph it br br sorry but this movie was just below average i have always been one to appreciate the work and talent that goes into a movie but this one just didn't have it
<START> yet again director j lee thompson unites with actor charles bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick in fact this is probably bronson's most brutal film quite a feat for a man who appeared in death wish ten to midnight and chato's land however brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film and the evil that men do is ultimately a disappointment if you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest br br the story is about a retired hitman bronson who lives a cosy life on a caribbean island he is persuaded to come out of retirement to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has been plying his vile trade around various south american hell holes throughout the film especially at the beginning we are treated to some graphic torture scenes to show us just what a nasty piece of work he is br br these themes are actually quite serious torture does go on in latin american dictatorships and everyday folk are made to suffer some despicably painful experiences simply for voicing an unpopular viewpoint but the evil that men do for all its worthy posturing isn't really bothered about the plight of these poor people it is bothered purely with giving charles bronson an excuse to blow away some unpleasant scum bags it's just an exploitative actioner which hangs its coat on genuine issues the torture sequences make you the viewer feel like a dirty sick in the head voyeur rather like someone who gains pleasure from viewing snuff movies the script is full of horrid dialogue including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture the evil that men do fails to explore its disturbing ideas its serves them up as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them sorry but that's just wrong
<START> i was giddy with girlish glee when i found out about this movie shortly after seeing spirits within br br after years of anticipation they gave november 2005 release date well november came and went followed by december oh look today's january 31 2006 no us release as of yet br br oh well i'm so glad i had a friend with a bootlegged subtitled copy d br br well the cg was great not as good as expected but near perfect i cringed however at the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the movie i had thought that we were passed this by now also i didn't really care for the anime look given to their faces i was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film and yet most of the characters have larger than norm eyes especially the girl characters they had personality though i'll give them that br br even though i'm not a big fan of anime i do have to say i was impressed with the wild fight scenes they were animated beautifully and had me hanging onto the edge of my seat br br for about the first two br br and there in lies advent children's biggest flaw it's mostly just a bunch of hyper stylized fight scenes br br a sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years instead they gave us a pretty piece of cg with barely a plot to excuse it's just under two hours running time br br where final fantasy is famous for its intricate stories this movie falls short you don't really get to know the characters the only way you'd have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game we barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threat br br what hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of characters were given they were nothing more than cloud's i'll call if i need you but i probably won't back up singers and to add to the hurt they had each character individually throw cloud higher and higher this little part here was so cheesy i almost turned it off i would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own off of walls to get himself up higher br br it hurt even more when they reduced the turks to less than just comic relief that was fine for the game but this is cinema people do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle they took away their dignity br br and spoiler yeah right most of you probably already know anyhow who remembers darth maul being hyped up in sw episode 1 yeah now picture that but with that's right he had maybe 5 minutes of screen time maybe that end spoiler p br br if this movie was made for the fans then way to go square if this is any indication of the direction you're taking the ff series i doubt you're going to be seeing much of my money i played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters br br you had a chance to make something epic something truly beautiful a masterpiece that flies in the face of all of the disney cg films br br instead you gave us a pretty piece of flesh with hardly anything underneath to hold it together way to go br br and i'm sure if the rest of the fans paused for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything but the cg they'd know what i'm talking about well i was gonna rate this a 5 10 but after thinking about it while righting this i'm giving it a 3 10 because they could have done better they have done better and this is just sad br br if they're gonna remake anything they need to do this one first
<START> i have to admit before i watched this film i thought this is one of those soppy love stories where everything works out fine and dandy all the way through but i was proved wrong when i actually sat down to watch this i found that it was in fact a really good story about a family who go to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and there the youngest daughter baby finds love but has difficulty getting there with her new found love due to disagreements with her father but along the way helps another dance instructor and risks the whole relationship a truly heartwarming film like no other br br 10 10
<START> the true story of a spanish ramÃ³n who fought for decades for the right to be this film along with the best picture winner of the same year million dollar baby caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons desiring death both advocates for the disabled and unfortunately for the disability advocates conservative pro life groups protested both films and their oscar nominations the nominations also came during the entire terry debacle just to put it all in some historical perspective the protests especially from the disability groups against million dollar baby make some sense Â the film clearly depicted without wavering the life of a as worthless the film's central character maggie fitzgerald becomes a doesn't seem to get any counseling whatsoever no help whatsoever and immediately wants to die the film is honestly pretty dumb and the sea inside based on the true story is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject it most likely got railroaded into the same category as million dollar baby without its protesters having even seen it an incredibly common phenomenon the film does give time to many different sides of the argument and it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone it is guilty of a couple of crimes though and i'd still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it first and foremost there's the protagonist's meeting with a bishop i don't look kindly on the way he's depicted his orally operated wheelchair is depicted as absurd and there's almost a comic sequence where his effeminate boy toy servants are dragging him in his chair up the stairs he can't even reach the room in which ramÃ³n is located and one of the boy toys is forced to carry the conversation between them i had to think gee maybe if ramÃ³n lived in a slightly more wheelchair accessible household he wouldn't spend his entire life in bed and might find life more fulfilling who knows how closely the film depicts the reality director amenÃ¡bar the others also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more life affirming like a cross cut sequence where ramÃ³n looks thoughtful and his lawyer's baby is born but besides a few ugly moments the film is very good it hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others however in the end our lives do belong to us shouldn't we have the right to choose the film's strongest asset is its supporting characters and the actors who play them it depicts how fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision the family members in particular are great and final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking and had me in tears my favorite performance in the film comes from lola whom i also felt gave the best or at least certainly most undervalued performance in almodÃ³var's last year
<START> the main problem with 9th company 9 is that it is not sure whether it wants to be saving private ryan or full metal jacket the attempts at spielberg sentimentalism are embarrassing such as the sergeant crying in a field of red flowers the training sequences have none of intensity or realism that kubrick gave them in his masterpiece br br a further bone of contention is that the afghan fighters are called ghosts because they strike and are hardly ever seen here they attack a russian strong hold almost in formation with no attempt to use cover i am sure tactics have move on since waterloo br br every scene in this film has been seen before in other war movies and done considerably better br br i have to ask why do all talented need to chew on a match br br finally i am always suspicious of a film that starts with no narration yet needs to qualify the end br br we won no you didn't
<START> the big knife a movie about the dark side of the hollywood motion picture industry is ironically far more like a filmed play than a film itself apart from a few very brief expository scenes all of the action takes place in the living room of the film's hero played by jack palance he's a movie actor who wants out of his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they put out his on again off again wife ida lupino is also fed up with the studio not to mention her husband's philandering ways unfortunately for them both the head of the studio rod steiger is a real bastard he has blackmail material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract but it's only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far br br this film is not i repeat not a film noir rather it's an exceptionally theatrical sitting room melodrama the plot proceeds at a snail's pace and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static setting and carefully contrived blocking of the actual scenes the acting is overwrought in the extreme and veers sharply between out and out histrionics and softer but no less unsubtle soliloquies that are obviously meant to be poignant but come across as pretentious twaddle especially in the hands of the woefully miscast palance aldrich was obviously going all out for a stylized something here but i doubt even he knew what it was and certainly the audience never does br br i think the main lesson here is that films and plays are very different mediums what might have worked in a play did not come across as even remotely natural or plausible on film the result a big waste of time there's little to enjoy here
<START> i'll say this first the film would've been a 70s sci fi classic if it had been executed a lot better br br that said let's examine the plot it starts with peter graves or is that clarence running for president then cuts to a goofy college campus like full of in goofy trucker caps and headsets and retarded athletes who all act like they're perpetually age 8 it then shows one guy apparently going to america having a party then taken to a medical lab where he is drugged wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors were bagging vegetables for steamers packs okay actually he's being put on ice so the doctors can extract the organs they need br br it then cuts to another dopey man thinking the place he's living in is a bit strange after a beer can of all plot devices possible he finds in a river makes him look suspicious damn those beer cans he and some equally stupid love interest of his feel they need to get to the bottom of it all so he makes her stay behind as he escapes through what is basically a large college administration building with some evidence he discovers on the way about cloning and how he's a part of it br br he escapes his after being shot some and an old reporter guy helps him find his 'father' the man he was cloned from it just so happens he's a clone of the brother of peter graves after debate about what to do with him and his evidence he goes back to the facility to find his girlfriend who has been lobotomized in the meantime to be even more stupid harmless and ready to host a talk show according to the sol crew he is captured and put into cold storage just like his nazi build retard friend from the beginning of the film br br meanwhile a confrontation at graves' brothers house results in several deaths including graves' the reporter guy and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation by a bomb it seems the conspirators have won to some extent br br then peter graves turns out to be able to survive being run through with a metal poker by the miracle of cloned parts and giving another for me' speech just as reporters confront him about the cloning thing br br definitely mst3k fodder but on the low end of the spectrum as far as overall badness goes
<START> i was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight i must say i was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot i was completely mistaken this movie was not only incredibly entertaining but everything about it i simply loved bruce campbell was as amazing as ever the biggest surprise was none other than ted raimi you know sam's little brother he played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue he did nothing but shine but i really cannot ignore the magic that is bruce campbell though i did think that ted raimi stole the show bruce did what he does best on the big screen somewhere between the sketchy nasty american business man and the tragic victim he displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly attractive to audiences the movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers the crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie took br br this movie may not be oscar material but my goodness it was amazing i would highly recommend this to any bruce campbell fan also anybody that likes campy sci fi movies do yourself a favor and watch this can't wait till this makes it out to dvd br br take it as you want to br br the fed
<START> no words can describe how awful this film is its like the director literally took a s in a roll of film and sent it out to the viewing public br br the acting in this movie is horrendous the plot is so dumb and the deaths of each character is laughably bad some stupid scenes include akshay kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram yes a hologram akshay kumar carrying a bazooka around the town bedi getting beaten up by a poorly animated skeleton bedi and double penetrating how did they think this was straight also i'd like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible the scene that supports this statement is when has the motorbike and somehow gains the glasses the shopping job looks like it was done in microsoft paint br br the best parts in this movie are with sunny deol this man is so strong that he makes even god feel scared in one scene he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it chuck norris' round house has nothing on that he is even so powerful that he can fly from london to india in a matter of 10 minutes overall this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe if you were to watch it watch it for the hilarity that ensues throughout btw this movie is supposed to be serious
<START> this is absolutely beyond question the worst movie i have ever seen it is so bad in fact that i plan on renting it again as soon as i can find it this movie makes 'plan 9 from outer space' look like an oscar contender just looking at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud i cannot say enough bad things about this movie it's awfulness perfection br br the plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in san francisco i think that's as far as i can go i am laughing too hard i know it shouldn't be funny but br br move over ed wood br br
<START> i've seen many dustin hoffman's movies like straw dogs or rain man and i liked them but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons i expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in straw dogs but i saw a totally different person he was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of al pacino in serpico the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son this movie is also revealing personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue
<START> this show is based on the concept that loud obnoxious repetition funny the comedic writing is non existent in fact i face serious repercussions by even comparing it to entertainment of any sort here is the premise two girls accidentally get their shenanigans posted on the internet and hilarity ensues after their initial success they contrive the idea that they should make a web cast to showcase their brilliance br br ok so where should i begin let's start with the laugh track the oft used but never successful reminder that we the viewing audience should laugh according to the foley guys this show is the funniest thing on the planet we should all be dropping loads into our pants because of the brilliance of the humor placed before us the laugh track seriously goes every few seconds it quite possibly scooby doo for the king of laugh track over use br br then the in your face shout at the top of our lungs the craziest grouping of words to seem silly trick is also employed with little to no success whoa and let's not forget creating new words to sound funny trick that is web o licious and poop tastic what the hell br br finally the acting i can't entirely complain here the actors are young and inexperienced but this should and can be corrected by good professional help because of the inexperience nick should be helping the actors define their craft instead in usual nick fashion the actors are placed in front of the camera and told act which for the most part is robotic recitation of lines missed timing and overall epic fail br br the lack of anything in this show makes it a disgusting representation of how not to be funny don't waste your time this show is to all of humanity
