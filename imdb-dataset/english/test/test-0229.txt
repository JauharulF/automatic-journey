<START> if you enjoy suspense this movie has it the fact that marina portrays a mute adds to her and increases the suspense alec guiness's appearance was nice but didn't really add to the movie i'm not sure if evan richard's part as andy clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot i thought the cinematography was excellent this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well the bathtub seen with the water in slow motion was wonderful also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done i would call it overall good entertainment
<START> the box 2009 cameron diaz james marsden frank langella james rebhorn holmes osborne sam oz stone celia weston truly disappointing adaptation of genre legend richard matheson's sci fi chiller button button by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker richard kelly who truly stretches a small well crafted piece into a grab bag a thon mysterious and ridiculously maimed man langella posits a million dollar offer to couple diaz and marsden both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt a box with a red button that when pushed will kill some stranger in the world sure strings are attached but does that really matter here what does is why in the name of god does kelly trowel on so much oddness i e nose bleeds watery transport systems Â that's right Â watery transport systems when the tension should be strung as tautly as possible oh the possibilities if this sounds like a bad twilight zone episode you are half right the '80s tv re boot actually did a decent small screen adaptation in fact rent that instead one of the year's worst films
<START> i have done a lot of international travel both on business and as a tourist for both types i assure you the best advice is also the oldest always drink the wine of the country in this movie the archangel michael comes to earth on business wraps it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little touring boy does he drink the wine of the country br br could man be drunk forever with liquor love and fights br br he'd rise up of mornings and lie down of nights br br these are things you can't do in heaven so he enjoys them while he's here of course it turns out he had a couple of other jobs to tackle and if he is less direct about them than he was about the first one he is just as successful the final scene is a little schmaltzy but it is also wonderful jean stapleton gets to dance with john travolta
<START> oh dear oh dear oh dear my lifetime was drastically wasted by this pile of stink i would rather chew off my arm than watch this film again painful story line painful characters and a painful two hours br br the best way of describing this movie is a follows i would rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my brain than watch another minute of this tripe br br advice is to stay well clear and let your local do you a favour of removing this rubbish br br lin you told me this was good br br
<START> it's always a pleasure to see characters in a movie who are wholly good hearted and well intentioned even when they're surrounded by those who are neither the film's moderately silly premise is that the conservative religious franklin family mother father teen boy and girl are involved in an accident wherein the parents and brother have a near death experience during which they meet jesus a pleasant but somewhat exasperated soul who removes from them the burden of sin ' when they return to their lives many of their views and attitudes have changed much to the consternation of the daughter who didn't share the experience the religious side is i think presented with a good balance from the good jesus to the starkly awful those of his who are obsessed with the sins of others and utterly oblivious to their own it's a movie to make you think give you a few good laughs along the way and leave you with the pleasant feeling that the world just might be a nicer place than you think it is
<START> spike milligan was one of the funniest men i've ever seen and a huge influence on my life br br this movie is limp and awful and does his memory no credit the script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact the leg jokes here are incomprehensible the actors' performances are uniformly ineffective a great cast wasted and the lead sean hughes delivers milligan's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine which misses the point completely br br the gentle pacing is a killer as well farce should accelerate towards the end the goon shows often did the novel definitely did but this film if anything slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax br br milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of in 1980 with t p mckenna dermot kelly norma ronald and jack hobbs now that's funny ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film i believe the lp was transferred to cd but don't know if it's still in print br br there is a movie of adolf hitler my part in his downfall with jim dale and arthur lowe it too is a godawful mess but it's funnier than this thing br br it's possible that milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen the other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking this film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint
<START> history teacher mrs tingle seems to have it in for student leigh ann watson who has her heart on achieving a writing school scholarship she receives another low grade from tingle which doesn't help when one of her classmates luke steals the paper of the final history exams and pops it in her bag mrs tingle finds it sticking out she threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it but he's not available so before she reports it the next morning leigh her friend jo lynn and scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal however due to stubbornness that find themselves reverting to drastic measures to stop this getting out br br wasn't fan of it when i first saw it and after another viewing i'm still not one writer kevin williamson was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films 'scream 1996 ' 'i know what you did last summer 1997 ' 'scream 2 1997 ' and 'the faculty 1998 ' he was riding the success also not to forget the tv show creek but this project would be the final bump the difference there compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay he was also making his debut in directing the strange thing though was that i found his direction to be competently done but material he stormed up to flavourless and tired it seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight out thriller without making it gel the script is cluttered with quick wit on going gags trivial stretches and gimmicky references towards other films but the problem is that it's too watered down with so many contrived developments and sappy moral currents disrupting the flow the fractured script had to be more strong and potent since it's a small scale production that feels like you're watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets it tries to play mind games with the characters but these moments are there to only serve the story's poor progression into a puddle of stupidity and senselessness the film's ending takes the cake williamson's polished direction is sound but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really plod on you eventually feel it after the halfway mark and it shows up how minor the story is the performances are tolerable enough although if it weren't for helen mirren's classy icy portrayal of manipulative prowess as mrs tingle and a buoyant marisa we would have been stuck watching a vapid goody to shoes katie holmes barry watson is modest in his slacker part and molly ringwald has a lesser role the soundtrack packs enough energy but i found it terribly overwrought and shapeless in its choices br br watchable but mechanical all round
<START> thank god i have fast forward i think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls whatever it's a stupid clichÃ© it doesn't make any difference there's this guy javier bardem who constructs buildings or something it doesn't matter he is handsome this javier bardem who cares i think there is a car wreck but i watched this in fast forward so who cares car wrecks and handsome heroes who struggle back from them smells like a melodrama to me javier likes someone but he marries maria de instead she is magnificently poetically beautiful with a heart shaped face then javier has an oral interface with who washes her beforehand for some reason you would think with her hand washed would be sexy no she is not this is a tedious story about a bunch of people who don't interest me javier and maria have a threesome how boring this film is annoying i think this might be a minor theme of some spanish language movies the rise and predictable fall of a little guy who succeeds against the odds let me just clear this up this is a high class melodrama or perhaps soap opera it is not worth your time except for a laugh
<START> i've seen this movie n i can say that this is really a bad movie the director's gone nuts of course he does know a lot about the army but then he certainly is a cheap guy there are a lotta technical flaws in the movies as well br br okay here's my doubt in the end when they rescue the family including a girl who was just raped why do they leave them there outside their place i didn't see any ambulance around there are a lot of aspects in the movie that are real but then i just wish the major had narrated helped assisted some other good director n made the movie br br mohanlal surely does deserve a better director
<START> hmmmmmmm cheerleader massacre let me think high school girls get sliced up except the cute one survives got it next movie br br i was actually surprised this one was made in 2003 i really thought they quit making these movies in the 80's this was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy dumb male horn dogs even dumber male adult and hot teacher it continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods we have seen it all before br br however this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal me too slashers so if you have got a few brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill you could do worse
<START> with all due respect to joel and rosemary and their characters department s will be forever associated with peter jason king br br most people remember him as this camp flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of austin powers but that will do a disservice to the character he's far more nuanced than that br br jason king is lazy he often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end he is egotistical his appreciation of people is based on whether they've read his novels or not a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever annabelle is right and she often is he's clearly a man having a mid life crisis and drink drives but jason king is brilliant if wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero it wouldn't have worked but he shows king often as a paper tiger led by his libido love of finery and prone to and it gets in the way of his detective work at times but he has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history and by not playing him as whiter than white the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it br br watching it again on dvd recently you get to see just how much depth wyngarde put into jason king
<START> when uwe boll cinema con man extraordinaire released the first house of the dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel hollywood's per capita ratio of morons must indeed be high for not only do we have a sequel it was distributed in the antipodes by sony a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write offs released direct to television in america the sequel does improve on the original in most respects but in so doing it becomes bland rather than interesting the scale of the scenario is enlarged with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring in particular the action is spread throughout the university where the first infected denizens can be found put simply the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found br br the cast on the other hand is a real step backward emmanuelle vaugier was specifically made up to resemble a low rent angelina jolie while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming it jÃ¼rgen prochnow in fact the only name that will stand out among this cast is one sticky who probably did not want to be recognised that easily by the people he faces at home put simply these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen even under the best direction say what you will about boll but he at least inspired actors like ona grauer to fight against his ineptitude that said the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was crafting some kind of misunderstood masterpiece and he took himself seriously unfortunately with the actors failing to take their characters or the predicament seriously what little dramatic tension there could have been is undermined br br much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise or to translate into more practical terms they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans how this would help when a non mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is anyone's guess but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own the we have to go back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic we are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by cruise missiles in ten minutes yet the heroes drive back into the university locate the sample they are looking for and fight off enough zombies to eat the army of china all in this space of time filmmakers take note it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension br br the special effects used in house of the dead 2 leave those of the original in the dust where uwe boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks michael hurst instead uses all the graphic details his budget can allow necks are bitten arms are cut off heads are shot it all makes for a much more convincing but it also disallows the mockery of obvious fakery the photography is also much improved as dvd crypt put it the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of the writing is also both an improvement and a setback throughout the script references to other horror and survival horror games the most obvious being run like hell are offered the first couple of times they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary everyday dialogue after the eighth time however they just get on the nerves because they remind gamers of things they would prefer to do with their time br br interestingly house of the dead 2 cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across america given that tom savini on his own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays i have to say i am somewhat impressed with the visual results in contrast to the much reviled original the zombies here look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly in a further contrast to the original the actors appear to have a clue what they are doing sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout the characters speak like real people however the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already when aliens the real dawn of the dead or the evil dead were released to acclaim the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before or did it so well that we did not really care house of the dead 2 is competent enough that we do not mock it but it brings nothing new or particularly brilliant to the table so we end up not caring either br br for that reason and many others i gave house of the dead 2 a two out of ten it is too good to be bad but too bad to be any good unless you are into sucky films as much as i am you are best to steer clear of it
<START> we picked this up as a part of a brentwood set under the title the broken skull shot directly onto video with widely varying sound and lighting quality this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness confusion and irritability and not in a good evil dead kind of way br br without going into spoilers what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre while there are some interesting ideas here the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying hunh br br this is a very very gory movie the gore effects range all the way from full bloody head appliances to a silly video toaster effect that has to be freeze framed to be dis believed the fangoria level of gross out effects in this film is really amazing and should likely please the gore hounds while making anyone with a weak constitution feel a bit on the queasy side br br the broken skull is also an extremely noisy movie it features not only ambient noises captured by mikes and not replaced in post but there is a lot of shrieking no no i mean a lot a lot a lot characters scream wail howl and yell and laugh maniacally turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves but you can't fault the cast for their enthusiasm they really eat up the scenery and sometimes the effect is rather entertaining in particular the actress playing a certain vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto br br in fact very few of the actors were wooden some of them may have overacted a bit oh just a wee smidgen but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off the cast is ethnically diverse and kudos to the filmmakers for that the two middle aged white women however are two of the most spiteful exasperated characters since the shopkeeper in the mst3k classic the brute man just watch them seethe at all the other characters it's fun br br in closing the may not become a horror icon on a par with jason voorhees michael myers or freddy kruger or even the leprechaun but we can definitely say this this was a movie
<START> seems to me that joe estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appearing in really bad movies joe spends most his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody he takes orders from a puffy faced angel of death who you might recognize as the puffy faced villain from tango cash and as the puffy faced cyborg from future war well joe and puffy have a job to do and it involves taking some souls of some kids in a big car being driven by a dumb who questions led zeppelin well the car crashes and the chase is on the lucky kids to escape joe look like harding and rick springfield they're chased around town break things and gets leered at by her mom while she's undressing for a bath the action winds up at a hospital where we learn that heaven is an elevator ride away in the end some green lights flash joe shouts and puffy vanishes without a trace wish i could say the same for this movie watch it from the relative safety of mst
<START> several years ago i saw this film without subtitles on television and despite me not understanding a word of what the characters were saying i still got the general idea and the mood of the film fascinated me no ends br br at long last i saw it again a few weeks ago my heart skipped when i saw the picture in the television guide and for 8 days until the film was really shown i told everybody i knew to go and see it the story reminded me a bit of alfred hitchcock's vertigo a slow brooding film about a guy who one day believes he sees the girlfriend that disappeared years before what follows is a wild rollercoaster ride of flashbacks changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot and at the end of the film i was left breathless i had definitely not got what i had expected and i had actually already seen the film be prepared to be confused br br 9 out of 10
