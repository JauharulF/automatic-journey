<START> there is only one word to define the whole movie that is awful how mostly martha was remade is awful the title of the movie is awful the actors are awful and the idea of combining good cooking and usa is awful if you have seen bella martha well that is the original title and it means beautiful martha this one is a punch in the stomach the acting of ms jones is so poor and unnatural that even jessica alba considered one of the worst actresses http www razzies com history would have done better not to mention the cook who would better play a different role and the little girl not worth mentioning bella martha was a very nice movie an authentic one why was it remade there was a story here they took it out there is no story what shall it represent in one way also this movie was perfect you know when all ingredients fit together well this is the case here a perfect crap
<START> i've seen worse which is a backhanded way of saying how crummy this film was the plot is ridiculous a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage in a dimly lit smoky new york school and somehow this clichÃ©d hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve are you serious a day long hostage situation with a wounded nypd officer no less takes all day i realize this film was made pre 9 11 but still i looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly drag this overdone plot on for another hour and 10 minutes br br the acting was mediocre at best all around and the characters were seemingly thought up by 7th graders the child abuse kid the pregnant scared girl the violent gang wannabe a confused unfortunate victim the wise cracking white guy please br br trying to make this hostage situation into a mission for more textbooks and better school conditions please this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a kid who shoots a cop they're confused ignorant idiots who get involved in a dumb far fetched situation don't try and paint them suddenly as noble the most laughable is ziggy who lives in the school's attic and admires michaelangelo so much so that he paints these striking scenes on the walls you've got to be kidding me br br the no racism signs in the protesting crowd a black kid shoots a black cop and a black negotiator tries to patch it all up this is a random message br br i understand the overall message which was poorly portrayed albeit by some actors who have gone on to respectable careers br br this was a joke though the red sniper lasers on the roof the worst scene was the kid fake snow falling dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof promise me etc how original br br the epilogue of i went to prison but now i'm pre law at university a fitting way to end a joke of a movie
<START> i cant go for long describing this simply because i do not feel strong about it i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it that's all i can say br br boring long sometimes even stupid br br p s 7 4 out of 10 the viewers must be going crazy br br i cant go for long describing this simply because i do not feel strong about it i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it that's all i can say br br boring long sometimes even stupid br br p s 7 4 out of 10 the viewers must be going crazy
<START> 'steamboat willie 1928 ' is often erroneously touted as the first mickey mouse film though that title actually goes to crazy 1928 ' the source fuelling this common misconception is probably an episode of the simpsons which places the origin of itchy the mouse in a 1928 short called 'steamboat itchy ' obviously a parody of this cartoon interestingly 'steamboat willie' was itself a parody spoofing the latest buster keaton release 'steamboat bill jr 1928 ' though the connection stretches little beyond the title and the general story setting in this walt disney short mickey mouse takes charge of a river steamboat much to the annoyance of captain pete the cat who casts him aside but mickey is not to be outdone in nastiness far removed from the pleasant wholesome mickey that more recent generations enjoyed this little mouse cares only for numero uno inflicting pain and displeasure on a series of farm animals in order to provide music for his own amusement br br first there's the laughing parrot which cops a bucket and a large potato to the head then a goat is cranked by the tail to provide music turkey in the straw from a guitar it has swallowed a cat is swung around by its tail a goose throttled about the throat and a piglet viciously booted for a children's cartoon 'steamboat willie ' directed by walt disney and ub certainly has some mean spirited humour though i also noticed similar elements though not quite to this extent in some later disney shorts like mickey 1934 ' let's not forget minnie mouse of course who suffers treatment for which she could today sue for sexual harassment the jokes may be crude and the animation perhaps even more so but this cartoon delivers a bucket full of laughs and it's easy to see why this little rodent became one of the most beloved characters in cinema history if you're a fan of mickey mouse or disney in general this is one steamboat you can't afford to miss
<START> is a nice surprise a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not funny or romantic takes actors like will smith kevin james and eva mendes into a fun light as a feather journey that actually had me laughing and yes a little aww how sweet br br meet alex hitchens will smith aka hitch he's a self proclaimed 'date he helps hopeless guys like albert kevin james win guys like amber unfortunately hitch has to deal with sarah eva mendes a gossip columnist bent on breaking the date doctor br br is actually pretty funny and it even makes the standard slapstick scenes work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly having fun i have to wonder why will smith hasn't made more movies like this his sharp rapid fire delivery is perfect for this genre and his chemistry with mendes and james is wonderful james is a real discovery i have never seen his show 'the king of queens' but he is funny and heartfelt and he proves once more that fat white men cannot dance hip hop smith's responses to his attempts are hilarious mendes is hot and bouncy not that way geez as smith's perfect match and amber is sweet as br br isn't perfect it's a tad too long and things get too dramatic near the end although this is redeemed by the happy ending filled with funny dancing it a great refresher from the cookie cutter romantic comedies that keep littering theaters
<START> scratch it just as created rhythms with the of an ass and virgin islanders oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands so did urban dj's itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression scratch is a wholly documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip hop rap movement and explore the genesis of the art of scratching vinyl and the ultimate dj mc entertainment expression the film reveals some surprisingly intelligent and articulate with startlingly unique abilities in concert and competition where the beat meets the street good stuff for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto gutter movements in sound art b
<START> a man wonders if his hunky co worker is gay at a yard sale he finds a ray gun called gaydar you point it at a person pull the trigger and it tells you how gay they are he tries it out it works and he sets out to find out if his coworker is gay like him br br promising idea ruined by an unfunny script after a promising beginning and terrible acting the entire cast overacts and basically scream their lines at each other constantly it gets annoying and really embarassing after a while the saving grace is that's it is short there's a scene stealing cat love her fall out of the kitty bed and charles nelson reilly is hysterical in his brief bit but none of this saves the movie i can't recommend this at all
<START> no matter what you've heard fame is not a good movie it's not worth the investment of over two hours to watch stereotypically troubled teens dancing singing learning and staring at girls in the dressing rooms br br every clichÃ© finds a cozy little home in this movie there's a gay teenager looking for acceptance that would have been great if it had been treated as anything more than a secondary plot point there's a ghetto kid who has too much attitude what was i surprised and guess what they all want to become big stars finding fame and fortune and they'd all be willing to crawl over their own mothers' smoking corpses to get it br br oddly enough this film is remembered for its music but in actuality the only moderately good song is hot lunch jam which is still too cheesy to be of any real quality the two most popular songs are nothing either fame is meaningless fluff drowned out by the sheer spectacle of a massive dancing in the streets scene and i sing the body electric what in name does that even mean is just an incomprehensible joke br br bad acting tasteless dialog and hack direction it is after all from the director of evita are only marginally helped by michael appropriately ordinary camera work but cinematography alone cannot carry a movie especially one as uninspiring and pointless as this
<START> i'd never heard of this aussie horror prior to michael elliott's enthusiastic review in fact after having read it i decided to check if the dvd was available at my local rental outlet and it was albeit a german edition i e sans the r1 extras so i opted to check the film out immediately br br while i wouldn't go so far as to give it full marks Â only a select few titles get them from me let alone an obscure modern flick Â i have to say that i was quite impressed with black water rather than looking back to previous crocodile movies such as alligator 1980 and lake placid 1999 it evokes the memory of two which saw a small group of people who go on a trip get lost and find themselves at the mercy of the elements and the creatures inhabiting the place Â namely long weekend 1978 itself a little seen but impressive australian production and open water 2005 br br the compact simply plotted film involves a couple and the woman's younger sister who decide to go fishing in a remote and forbidding part of the australian wilderness known as crocodile territory very soon in fact before even 15 minutes have elapsed their boat is and the guide killed by an alligator Â so our luckless adventurers take refuge up a tree the dvd talk reviewer believes the film suffers from spending too much time in this one location Â with the three arguing about what they should do attempts to retrieve the boat seeking a way out of the jungle through the trees only to be met with nothing but water and the occasional attack by the monster however i think the makers take the situation as far as it will go without slipping into tedium this is due to the palpable suspense and as michael said the believability of the characters particularly the two women Âbut also the fact that the crocodile here makes for one of the scariest and most memorable in recent memory i wonder how they got it to br br i also agree with mike that the film contains some really effective shock moments Â the alligator leaping out of the water to take a bite at the petrified heroes its head suddenly emerging in front of the women as they're making for the boat even though one of them does reach the vehicle the monster manages to lift its massive weight and get in the boat with her towards the end as the same girl manages to find a gun on the mangled body of their guide loads it and lies in wait for the alligator to appear the latter sneaks up from behind her incidentally the creature is bestowed with the craftiness of the shark in jaws 1975 with this in mind the finale is just as crowd pleasing though on an obviously smaller scale as that of the classic spielberg blockbuster Â even if it has a downbeat follow up another definite asset is the film's sparse score Â which is generally rather lovely but becoming unnerving at just the right moments br br at the end of the day black water emerges as a breath of fresh air in the face of the slump into which horror cinema has fallen of late for this reason alone it deserves greater exposure so as to remind us that there's hope yet for our beloved genre without the real necessity of resorting to the gimmickry of a cloverfield 2008 to command attention Â

<START> this is one of the best movies on the french revolution ever produced being a person well versed in the the period i was amazed at the level of detail the costumes are spot on even the detailed little day to day items such as ink wells serving plates etc are all perfect as an american living in france who has access to the sites in the movie through his membership in various historical associations such as the napoleonic alliance i can not over state how impressed i was with the visual accuracy of the film br br the dialogue where known is virtual quotations and the where not recorded is in character i was extremely pleased with this movie and am disappointed that it is not out on dvd yet this is how historical drama should be done must see
<START> having seen only once and in the dawn hours i can't seem to forget this haunting film a mix of mystery suspense and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of vertigo the actors though not that well known are good especially joan hackett in one of her best performances you believe in her in her love in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love and in the end in her overwhelming pain the plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility the direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect and it has one message don't let revenge blind you you can became its last victim a real pity it has not been remade but perhaps it is a period piece better left alone
<START> a truly remarkable film that takes you on a journey through your hidden emotions a deep and enlightening story the story takes you through the lives and beliefs of gay and religious cultures with excellent performances from an superb star cast it will touch the deepest reaches of your emotions for those who belief that a love that risks nothing is worth nothing the film starts with introducing us to the characters that on the surface seem to have everything later we find that beneath the surfaces of each character they are looking for a journey of self discovery we learn from this story that we all must chose the path in life that we are destined to be on despite what difficulties we encounter an all thumbs up film
<START> worst movie ever its not clever or funny or thought provoking 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best with an awful script br br acting was so bad that you can see the dead people breathing br br maybe the writer director combination believed they were quentin tarantino or something you know make a movie about nothing still cool but failed miserably br br i hope the writer never makes another movie ever not everyone is born a writer sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom attendant or whatever br br please don't watch this movie even on mute with the stereo going its still a painful 84 mins
<START> george barry is a genius death bed the bed that eats is a prototype for much of the fiction and camp surrealism that is so chic now truly innovative maverick and just effing brilliant hyper strange acting subtly nightmarish atmosphere i recommend reading stephen book nightmare usa there is a chapter devoted to barry and death bed the bed that eats available from fab press on a related note death bed the bed that eats and beyond dream's door make a perfect double bill furthermore it's trite and tired and ultimately stupidly ironic to criticize a low budget cult film for being made' or inept ' the b movie aesthetic is part of these films' charm no amount of cgi could duplicate the cumulative effect death bed the bed that eats has on the viewer with an advanced palate
