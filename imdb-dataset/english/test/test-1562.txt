<START> five star final was one of the best films of the early 1930s it starred edward g robinson and was a very gritty story about a sleazy newspaper and their willingness to do anything anything to sell newspapers in particular an old story of an innocent woman is plastered across the pages and helps to destroy her now happy life many years after she was inadvertently involved in a scandal the reason i loved the film so much was that it was unflinching and pulled no punches showing just how low the publishers can be to sell papers br br here in two against the world it is a remake of five star final with a few changes instead of robinson this film stars humphrey bogart and he is the head of programming at a radio station not a newspaper otherwise the story is essentially the same except that it's a bit less edgy and lacks some of the grit and sensationalism of the original this isn't to say the film is bad it just doesn't pack quite as good a punch as the first film in other words if you must see one of these films see the first though this film is quite powerful and enjoyable as well as for me i loved the story so much i saw both films and enjoyed them both br br two against the world begins with the ubc radio owner complaining to his programming head bogart that all the high brow shows he's put on are getting low ratings the owner demands muck lots of muck in order to get more listeners one way they discuss is to do a multi part dramatization of a famous killing that occurred two decades ago even though the killer was acquitted and she killed only in self defense however they decide to play up the story as if she was guilty and they even go so far as to both send a writer to the lady's home pretending to be a minister as well as broadcasting her current name and whereabouts needless to say this ruins the woman and leads to a horrible tragedy then and only then does bogart feel any real remorse for producing such garbage leading to a dandy finale about journalistic integrity and decency br br well acted a great story idea and a message that is just as important today as it was back in the 1930s this is one story you have to see in particular notice the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene where the daughter attacks the owner and bogart it is one heck of a great example of acting and writing
<START> a fine ironic visual gag takes place in front of the spectacular backdrop of a twirling windmill but who are those people who rush across screen at the end customers relatives one of the earliest enigmas in cinematic history perhaps well worth a minute of your time
<START> kind of a guilty indulgence nowadays this used to be required watching when i was in high school it really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in la in 1980 as the bands play prints the lyrics in subtitles which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the guy is screaming into the microphone but also it turns the camera's pov into that of tourist passing through this alien world the band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn't exist anymore then again it's not as easy to come by 16 month former church closets like chavez of black flag does how many unheard of bands do you know that aren't trying like the dickens to get a record deal these guys just didn't care and who can't love the commentary of the little french dude who used to be the singer for catholic discipline of which was a member his gritty voice delivers one of the best soliloquies ever captured on film i have excellent news for the world there's no such thing as new wave whew what a relief
<START> there's something intriguing about disaster movies the simple primal premise can lead to several great stories granted most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but i can usually live with that br br unfortunately flood probably marks the low point in the history of this sub genre robert carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie even though screen time is split between different locations and characters he gives a barely decent performance as well joanne whalley is very uneven veteran actor tom he played in doctor zhivago for heaven's sake is particularly bad i mean his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor what an embarrassing performance for that man the rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception whom i thought might be there as a plot device eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance doesn't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared br br the script is really bad confusing and clichÃ© some of the worse lines i have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other you've seen this story a thousand times it employs every dramatic hook and tear jerkers you've seen in outbreak armageddon the poseidon movies original and remake and many others br br the direction is awful no sense of timing nothing inspired the shots are bland dialog and action both fail to flow editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess without a doubt this movie tried to rely way too much on rather poor cgi the human factor the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done the made for tv feel gives nausea some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter no problem let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground in the most obvious way possible br br the movie score is rather poor all over the place no timing br br the ending is probably the worse i have seen in quite some time very much like they ran out of ideas scrap that you can't run out of something if you never had it in the first place must have ran out of budget br br this is a really amateur job i give it a 2 for using london as a location which is a nice change for being actually decent in a key support role and for the few cgi shots that were decent those of the water closing in on london and the gates br br do yourself a favor and check out day after tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one this includes older classics like the towering inferno
<START> im sure he doesnt need the money for a life saving operation or transplant in all honesty i think this review qualifies as a better movie than thanks for listening
<START> all budding filmmakers should watch this movie it is like a masterclass in digital film making in itself some of the scenes look like they have been shot on much higher production values than what they really have been it is very encouraging that such a well crafted piece of work can be made on a low budget the acting is very good and the characters are very interesting particularly that of the lead boy john who manages to play a teenager experiencing difficulties whilst remaining really likable his beautiful but fading mother was also very well portrayed and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing this is a very quirky interesting piece and i will be looking for anything else made by the same team the director is certainly one to watch
<START> i think that this short tv series was absolutely wonderful and gave both a in depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time this was by far david attenborough at his best i personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade this is definitely worth peoples money br br i also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part it was incredible to find out that the 'blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life br br in this documentary almost certainly lived up to his high reputation br br this was a masterpiece and will always be considered to be one of the best modern documentaries br br many to the 'blue planet' team
<START> set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural italy it's a story of madness the landscape may be quite picturesque but there's madness herein concealed behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal this person kills little children br br in style and tone this film resembles dario argento's famous italian giallos those fascinating whodunit horror films except that argento's films are much better looking still the visuals in fulci's don't torture a duckling are competent with some interesting compositions and lighting lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence wherein one of the is vulnerably alone br br in one sequence the gore is a bit overdone but this is no slasher film a legitimate theme the story and that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic br br plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer doesn't assume an agenda on the part of the director don't dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect the twist near the end provides good misdirection however in one scene midway through a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters one of whom is the murderer the film's finale takes place on a beautiful with the wind whistling in the background we see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killer's mindset br br i don't care for the film's widescreen projection but background music is effective and ranges from jarringly creepy at the beginning to low key jazz to indigenous italian songs acting is generally average though in a couple of cases it's a bit overdone br br though not as visually brilliant as argento's giallos don't torture a duckling nevertheless is a fine film one that contains a thematic storyline and enough of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries
<START> this game is a good looking first person shooter hang on br br but of course a story must be put around this genre so a quite innovative plot about soldiers now driven by drugs to save the world and kill the terrorist nectar is the drug of choice which creates a super soldier br br great now just give us some fun challenging missions throw in some great new weapons and free terrain vehicles that can be driven at our leisure and i will be quite content br br no br br the maker's of this game decide to create a military driven game that tries to make sense of our fears of terrorism and embracing democracy the game has twisted ideals that just re enforce morals that we learned when we were in primary school nothing new is told to us but drugs are bad then pushed in a type of yvan join the navy of how standing up for the common good given rants on normality and abnormality right and wrong we get it let's kill something br br no br br you can't you are forced to endure extremely long gaps of completing bullsh t objectives such as run to helicopter go to group of troops then once this is completed cinematic takes over you sit there for at least half of the game watching little played out by the characters one's you cannot skip but sit and wait sometimes when people aren't even talking we sit and wait for a helicopter to land br br bad game by a laughable group of programmers don't bother making another because i will rather see the movie
<START> one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance adventure movies as if those weren't reason enough to love it anyone who after seeing this movie complains about connery's accent or the lack of historical verisimilitude or the realism of the political motivations or any other extra movie concerns simply doesn't love movies see it and be awed by the star power of the two leads the exotic romantic photography and music and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film this is proof that hollywood can make 'em like they used to when it really wants to a solid 8 10
<START> all i have to say is one word sucks the only reason i gave this a 2 is because josh hartnett was in it and he's cool should have beat that klein guys ass stupid dumb and brainless by the end of this movie you can't stand klein and you really don't care what happens to leelee hartnett was the only good thing about it
<START> if we really want to get serious and find osama bin laden then we should take this stinker down to gitmo and force the to watch it they'll be singing within minutes of course i'm sure that making them watch this god awful dreck violates the geneva convention in several ways br br look my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch tv at home so take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little tv zombie she got up and walked away after about ten minutes that's how bad this is br br you know when the person responsible for this garbage was a young writer i bet he or she had dreams of the great american novel now they have to look in the mirror every morning with the realization that they wrote what is possibly the worst hour of television in the history of the medium br br and we wonder why the rest of the world hates us
<START> taste is a subjective thing two people can watch the same movie with one of them loving it and the other one hating it as it concerns 'halloween the curse of michael myers' i fall into the latter category br br i'm of the opinion that john carpenter in 1978 made one of that decade's finest fright films which despite its flaws still holds up well into the 21st century it reused many of the old horror film devices but utilized them in original and effective ways it had no pretensions that it was anything other than a movie about an escaped mental patient stalking babysitters on halloween night and yet there were 'ideas' in the film but they were subtly introduced and not hammered into your skull it juxtaposed the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what was taking place in the story and it did this with a wonderful ambiguity br br the of this 'film' probably wouldn't even understand that previous paragraph that's why we're saddled us with this miserable and inept piece of disposable celluloid direction script acting are of the lowest strata imaginable this is the type of film that is so mind numbingly dull and nausea inducing as to make you want to crawl back into the womb and die it is also truly truly sad to see veteran british actor donald pleasence wasting his acting abilities with this saliva puddle of a movie he seems drained of all his energy and resigned to the fact that this may be his last film maybe that's what killed him
<START> clouzot followed le where no one knew who was penning the poison thus everyone was suspected with another masterpiece quai des four years later in which we know from the outset or think we do whodunnit top billed louis jouvet doesn't appear for forty minutes by which time clouzot has established a rich milieu of music hall music publishers etc and a fine cast of colourful characters angela lansbury lookalike lansbury appeared in woman of paris that same year suzy scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husband bernard blier who follows her to the home of an elderly letch only to find he is already dead from here things go seriously wrong his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his pre arranged alibi is out the window whilst meanwhile unknown to him his wife confesses to the murder to the photographer neighbour a closet lesbian in love with her who volunteers to return to the crime scene and retrieve scarf and as long as she's there thoughtfully wipes her prints of the murder weapon a champagne bottle at this point investigator jouvet gets involved and from then on it's a case of keeping the plates spinning in the air clouzot's output was relatively small but virtually all of it was as spencer tracey said in another context with le de and les diaboliques still to come in short this is a must for french cinema buffs
<START> i have a letter from ms knight who went to college with my older sister in it she tells of the hardships of making this film she herself was pregnant an interesting conjunction with the movie's plot and the novice director was unsure fairly green and having great difficulties with all the decisions logistics etc they were on the move all the time and it was a very difficult shoot br br the film however with a strong debut for james caan remains effective and affecting it's a great showcase for the talent that ms knight has demonstrated her entire career on television in movies and on the stage where she won the tony for kennedy's children br br this film has aged well
