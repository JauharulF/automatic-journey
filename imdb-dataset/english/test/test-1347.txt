<START> i recently got the movie and all i can say it is a good movie there's a lot of famous rome monuments and historical locations it is from the same writer and director from the da vinci code tom hanks stars along with ewan mcgregor and the movie starts out with the space and time experiment in sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the the plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything its a race all of rome following the trail to get to the secret meeting place while racing against time to find the path of the over all its a movie worth seeing hell i watched it 3 times and i still like it so in the end go buy it it is a lot better than the movie 2010 and the ending has one awesome plot twist
<START> fun bad movie which should amuse one of joan crawford's last performances as the driven successful editor vs all those young beautiful eager beavers fresh out of the elite seven sister colleges great '50's ambiance of new york wonderful period costumes and hairdos terrific art direction trite story but tearjerker interesting cameo by robert evans as a rich cad
<START> i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles the fact is that there are no volcanoes in los angeles this movie should not be filmed in los angeles it should be filmed in honolulu hawaii hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this movie should be made in hawaii's state capital this movie should be filmed in hawaii because this is the real idea and not in los angeles there are earthquakes in los angeles but there are no volcanoes to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense
<START> i purchased a dvd of this film for a dollar at the big dept store that's probably the best and kindest comment i have to offer on it at least it didn't cheat me out of the cost of lunch br br the problem with chiller is craven's problem as a director the man has his apologists who claim his traveling papers prove he's a really smart guy and all around sharp but it's no secret that as a director he has never possessed one iota of the visual and story telling sense of a hitchcock as vigorously attested by chiller he's much closer to that legendary flat foot gordon lewis what craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film making br br let's be specific the transitional moments of this film are sleek the establishing shots give it the feel of a quality production the film looks professionally put together in the way a film shot by a tv commercial director would a thought the films only visual distinction these transitions that at least look professionally handled may very well be the work of some second unit directors it's the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions the drama that fall flat br br the core of the proceedings are invariably perfunctorily handled the critical shots after say the departing car drives into the well positioned camera then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital then to the waiting area and hallway then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action are quickly dispensed so we can hurry up and get to the next part craven never comes anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment the net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts and the fumbling rush to keep things moving is a film that feels like the work of the fledgling art student who sharpens all his pencils adjusts his easel and lighting set up grinds all his stretches and primes his canvas and then has nothing to say craven like the art student never gets to the meat of the exercise br br for craven apologists who will point out that this film was made for tv i will point to spielberg's duel and say no more
<START> latter days br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format stereo br br trouble flares when an la party boy wes ramsey falls in love with a handsome mormon missionary steve br br a huge hit on the festival circuit and on limited theatrical release this likable movie the feature debut of screenwriter c jay cox sweet home alabama is an exercise in in which ramsey's shallow minded character is changed forever after falling hard for vulnerable beauty who is constrained by the dictates of his religious convictions here the path of true love is paved with hardship not least of which is the reaction of fellow mormons to his newfound sexuality which results in his excommunication from the church and the wrath of his indignant parents mary kay place has a small but devastating cameo as the boy's outraged mother but cox's script focuses chiefly on ramsey's path to redemption as his hedonistic lifestyle is thrown into disarray by influence and by the responsibilities which emerge as a consequence of his developing maturity he volunteers as an outreach participant delivering food to aids patients living at home leading to an unexpected friendship with former party boy erik palladino tv's er whose illness provides ramsey with a much needed wake up call br br cox's script is laced with juicy one liners and various pearls of wisdom on mormonism your church doesn't like alcohol or homosexuals well i'm definitely not joining i can't imagine heaven without both and the characters are surprisingly complex and well drawn ramsey has the sexier role he's first seen doing something rude to a willing participant but it's who has become something of a gay icon with his sensitive portrayal of a sweet natured innocent whose journey from darkness into light leads to a startling revelation about his place in the world around him he and ramsey are well matched and their inevitable sex scene brief but memorable is followed by a compelling sequence in which ramsey describes a childhood trauma which has defined his life to date br br filmed on hi def video and transferred to 35mm for theatrical exhibition the movie's meager budget places limitations on the scope and grandeur of cox's ambitions though the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this minor drawback jacqueline bisset shines as a worldly wise restaurateur at the diner where ramsey waits tables for a living and joseph gordon levitt third rock from the sun steals everyone's thunder as fellow mormon opposed to his friend's relationship with ramsey on religious principle but only on principle though a little stilted in places the movie with romantic longing and deserves plaudits for its honesty and compassion best seen with a crowd of like minded viewers preferably with a loved one by your side
<START> this event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that i believe is not equaled today the colorful characters in their stereotypical garb brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then a kid could watch it without watching an episode of jerry springer br br looking back now i was 5 at the time although i loved both warrior and hogan i think i enjoyed warrior more because of his mystique hogan was the branded hero who an impressive public image the ultimate warrior on the other hand was a masked man of few words an out of the limelight hero for a different audience br br this rivalry was so exciting as a kid because of this duality in me duking it out for each combatant i had a place for both of them because there was bloodshed too in this long heavy battle the stakes were high at least to me as a kid on a similar note because of hogan's defeat this made him more human i remember feeling kind of sorry for him br br all of these emotions at play in the juvenile boy's soap opera made wrestlemania vi such a great time to witness this game
<START> it's not often i feel strongly enough to post something about a film this was however simply the worst movie i have ever seen the performances were laughable at best at worst they were well there's no other word for it awful especially the lead female who's random sexual come ons have to be seen and heard to be believed honestly the plot is nonsensical the dialogue appalling and the characterisation there is none i'm surprised it's not an alan smithee film i can't stress this strongly enough avoid at all costs how do movies like this ever get made this is no budget film making at its very very worst
<START> this starts out interestingly as there's a carnival right next to someone's house with an oil rig right there too and some kind of store front church across the street with a neon jesus saves sign all right in one tiny area now that's pretty dazzling if improbable and then we go right into the movie which takes improbable to new levels of course this is a lame remake of the 1979 thriller starring carol kane as the babysitter jill johnson now jill is some chick that ran her cell phone minutes up so high her evil parents are punishing her by making her work it off probably something that the audience this movie targets can identify with jill is taken to this huge and fancy house on a lake in the middle of nowhere of course by her dad to babysit for the family the children are already nestled all snug in their beds when jill arrives and the housekeeper is still there huh she couldn't babysit of course despite the remote location one of jill's friends pops by one whom with which she apparently has issues as in boyfriend stealing or something anyway of course the alarm in the house goes off for no reason and then calls from someone start coming in calls from someone that wants to kill her of course jill calls the cops and since there hasn't been any actual threat on her life they blow her off but tell her to call back if there's anything else they can do for her check out the scene with jill calling her friends at the high school bonfire pep rally or whatever it's supposed to be it looks like some kind of burning man festival there's all kind of contrived scares in this including the cool cat chester who of course pops up here and there one of the horror movie clichÃ©s there is i will admit that i dozed off at some point during this and did i miss anything hard to tell or care really this is one of those films that makes me wonder how bad the remakes of amityville horror house of wax or the fog could have been anyway from reading online reviews it seems like the folks that were the most scared by this were 12 year old girls and i can only assume that from statements like it made me pee pee my pants well one can only hope that this will put an end to hollywood remakes of films that weren't exactly stellar to begin with but don't bet on it 2 out of 10 and i'm being overly generous
<START> tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i've seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen it's a hell of a puzzler
<START> if you want to see a movie with nudity sex drugs alcohol brutal beating of a woman and child rape this movie will satisfy you if you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him this movie has it you've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going the surprise is that in a story of violence action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence without a pedantic speech which transforms the movie look for a final scene that is an unexpected evidence of a wounded person healing perhaps we who wonder why we wallow in the abundant profane will learn that love can be located above the loins in the heart from the pumping pounding follow the rhythm to where where love is sacred
<START> i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher wasn't involved with this movie an american leftist laundry list of axes to grind with a distinct of democrats in hell mao and karl marx didn't make an appearance in hell but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler perhaps we'll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures br br cheap shots at religion right wing politicians corporations and their fox news even suvs all the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the other side of the aisle to not have been a conscious effort the singular exception i noticed in the hour and a half is jfk has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non partisan
<START> and i for one think that is a good thing i've just never been a rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this br br as for the rest of the production i think it was slightly less than the original movie one of my favorite minor characters in the original was with her scratchy fingernails on the blackboard voice belting out hey it takes a lot more than no talent to be a and although i missed it i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy br br i also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre not just at the movies br br i think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song let me entertain you which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it
<START> it's hard to believe that with a cast as strong as this one has that this movie can be such a dud it's such an incredibly horrible film how was it ever made how did so many good actors wind up in such a terrible film don't waste your life don't watch even one moment of this film
<START> when i first saw the trailer for this film i really wanted to see it i thought some of the director's other works were quite good but i must say i was disappointed the plot involves a young woman who lives with a widowed father and two his two sons they move into a well guarded community yet all is not as it seems a sort of twin peaks the woman begins to see or not see things an people during the first reel i had a hypothesis and thought this can't be the whole reason well the ending lived up or better down and gave us what i felt was a truly weak final act the sound mixing and quality is excellent saw it in a thx certified theatre and was impressed by the audio and only the audio the picture is missing substance
<START> well there's a few things about this movie everyone should see it you see the nation of iraq like you've never seen it covered by the media and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most americans where the movie has its main audience however all that glorious stuff in mind lets take a look at a few other facts of the movie there were 150 cameras handed out to the iraqi people most all of which view the war and subjugation of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the bettering of their nation and in comparison to saddam it is simply a feeble scratching at the skin also netflix as its main distributor advertised it before the fun election we just had by sending out a mass e mail to its entire roster to see the film many of the what should be labeled as opinions played out as facts listed off by the interviewed iraqis are wrong if one is to review the red records of abu ghraib tortures it wasn't henchmen who were being tortured it was a fine mix of a 80 90 innocent civilians and 10 20 rightfully detained people never was it disclosed that any of that 10 20 were henchmen or curfew violators in addition the arab world really has never listed as one of their opponents more correctly it is the usa's 6 billion dollars a year to our military bases in saudi arabia and our interest in oil i agree that the media is a complete distortion but this film shows that same distortion i'm afraid that the iraqi people that this film represents have been edited to speak with a yankee voice yes its true that saddam is a puke and that his removal many see for the best its true that some iraqis actually get paid a good wage just as its true that no iraqi people have control of their most prized oil and us corporations do nor does it mention that 20 000 civilians have died due exclusively to us artillery still 15 of the country which once had running water and now does not nor does it mention that from 1993 2003 un sanctions purposed and authored by the usa government killed over 200 000 iraqi civilians nor does it mention that democracy in when people decide the government not a massive war machine that sends the message 'be killed or i am afraid that the cutting room floor must have quite a bit of iraqis that aren't so happy with the occupation just as the vast majority of the world was not for the war in fact the america britian spain and the rest of them are not carriers of democracy they turned their back to it when they saw how full their pockets could be hurray saddam is out of power but i'm afraid that no iraqi is yet in power corporations are in power the media is in power read do your own research and don't let them blindfold you
