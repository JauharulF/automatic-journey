<START> doll master is an example of a lousy horror film fallen somewhere in the space with it's two not so well established genres a horror film and an emotional drama film seems like the doll master tries very hard to be a very scary horror film but it fails the noise of the dolls while moving is like taken from the of in ju on and the crawls are like esquire the killing dolls will remember you a cute version of chucky but compared to child's play this film is more superb but the story seems a nothing the brilliant camera shots and the brilliance of acting was taken away cause of the plot br br watch this if you are expecting great shocks
<START> yes i know roscoe arbuckle didn't like to be called 'fatty' but i couldn't resist the joke br br this is a fine lloyd hamilton short from his peak period directed by roscoe the two work together with lots of good gags and usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting roscoe uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show ham as a fine actor as well as a talented comedian br br this story plays with some interesting themes like lloyd's classic move along here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off
<START> director and playwright richard day adapted his own stage material for the screen clearly inspired by rock hudson's real life dilemma from the 1950s what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to quell the gossips and keep him working wispy thin idea given some energy by the good cast and retro production design which amusingly resembles a greeting card by shag the dialogue isn't very clever and there's some slapstick goofing around near the beginning which fails to work spitting out food etc still when a serious tone comes over the final act it is handled with great taste and is far more welcomed by the viewer than all the klutzy silliness matt does good work as movie hero male whore guy stone but are his experiences here enough to strengthen his character or would he be right back at the bar the next night the movie seems not to know or care day wants to get off a few one liners and one carefully written pro gay speech a plea for tolerance but he has no other agenda for audiences who invest their time and interest in these people the sentimental bow on this thing can look like nothing more than a prank 1 2 from
<START> oh god why i am aghast at the sheer ineptitude of this delicious nonsense as if all that makes sense well like this film from bottom rung poverty row of 1940s hollywood nothing in this door slamming horror made on three sets makes much sense except the horniness of dr jerkoff who lusts uncontrollably after some piano player's daughter who has big melons and a it is just terrible and even has a gorilla and a big dog for pointless added distractions more than elephant man and that is just at 62 minutes the monster maker is the sort of film kids in 2005 just howl at with disbelief and wonder what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth that made them the lovable movie kooks they are today i guess you just had to be there in 1944 or whenever the hell this mad drivel was shown to impressionable 13 year olds in glorious 3000 seat velvet movie palaces on a wet day somehow it was made for no reason by movie scammers prc pictures in the war years by escaped german refugees who knew who to make a film since they got out of europe as the nazis advanced on ufa studios the monster in this film like the mad scientist is actually a nazi nightmare

<START> i saw sweeney todd on broadway in 1980 it starred george and featured most of the other cast principals who appeared in the national touring company production which was videotaped for tv in los angeles in 1982 last night i watched the new dvd release of the los angeles production although i have owned the videotape for many years the production and the performances could have hardly been better but the original age showed because both the audio and video quality are below modern standards even on a newly pressed dvd nevertheless i still give it 10 out of 10 because of the greatness of the work and george and lansbury's startlingly wonderful performances even today my most memorable recollection from a live musical theater performance has to be rendition of these are my friends you'll drip brrr
<START> it's now 2005 and 15 years since this cartoon first aired i haven't actually watched it seriously or closely in about 10 years now that i'm an adult in my 30s i can look back with a serious eye as i watch the episodes again br br in concept the cartoon is partly an homage to the classic looney tunes but also its own original show there are a few episodes that are structured like the old cartoons for example there is a singer that attacks buster and so he exacts revenge on this singer's concert exactly like the old bugs bunny cartoon the ensuing cartoon is similar to looney tunes just in a different era if you look at the old looney tunes they did an awful lot of stuff exactly like tiny toons did the old looney tunes made a lot of social commentary and parody there were celebrity impersonations there were a lot of corny period jokes slang and dialog the comedy was surreal and wacky you can say this exactly for tiny toons as well the comedy styling is the same most definitely a throwback to the classics which hadn't been done well if at all in cartoons in the decades prior to this show we recognize the cultural references in tiny toons and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up but the reason we don't think looney tunes are corny is because we weren't alive back in the 40s also looney tunes was original back in those days but today cartoons are rehashed over and over so it's easy to perceive tiny toons in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general br br there certainly are differences in many respects the timing the delivery and obviously the duration of the shows they are two different styles from two different periods being done under two very different circumstances looney tunes being made for adults in theaters and tiny toons being made for kids watching tv even so they did a good job making an original show with original gags and still paying homage to and after the comedy stylings of the old looney tunes br br since tiny toons had a lot more time to play with they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration you only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3 the baby plucky toilet episode there are so many more for example one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in when babs and buster are on the phone in a split screen hoping each misses the other the miscommunication is spectacular notably the character development in this episode and in several others usually the ones penned by deanna oliver or sherri stoner is rather good the female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period br br this was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture referential and self referential humor this was way ahead of its time tiny toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids yes i loved transformers and thundercats but tiny toons totally jumped away from all that it was a breath of fresh air bakshi's new adventures of mighty mouse may have been a precursor but tiny toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success br br as a kid i totally overlooked some jokes for example one episode is an homage to the marx brothers that i completely ignored as a teen now i have a newfound respect for it there are so many inspired gags that i never noticed that are genuinely brilliant it's that kind of comedy that makes me think of looney tunes and family guy i never noticed that kind of comedy as a kid i've been thinking this for most episodes i watched recently br br you'd notice these kinds of things if you actually watched the show unlike some other reviewers here who i know are unfairly judging it i've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly exposed both as a kid and as an adult br br you can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too i'm not talking about just the main characters but the side characters were done really well and creatively too but back to the main characters some of the main characters were brilliant tress macneille had in my opinion her best performances in this cartoon she hasn't been the same since rob paulsen also did some incredible stuff here too br br this is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes it had plenty it had a lot of mediocre ones too but by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch br br out of 10 i give the show an 8 5 and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons
<START> i must say one big reason why i thought the aristocats was so great is because i love cats i love cats which probably gave this film a big score from me but not only that it was definitely a good movie as well and i love where they make the setting of the film take place this is one of my favorite animal films although it's animated and i really love how the actors actresses didn't sound so unprofessional behind the animals' voice's to me this film seems like a classic but i guess to imdb it's not because it has yes i think too low of a rating you take a peek at all the other original disney films and they have a much higher rating than this but nonetheless aristocats is one of the best animation movies there is and i could enjoy it over and over again
<START> clichÃ© avoidance is one of this film's main achievements when you hear a vague outline of the story Â erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in barcelona Â you predict a collection of euro stereotypes in a farcical tangle pas du tout in fact it's a finely judged comedy about a young frenchman xavier trying to make sense of human relationships there are some excellently observed minor roles the arrogant french neurologist the insufferably irrepressible brother of the english girl forlorn mother and some fine visual humour especially in the opening scenes mocking the complexity of the application procedure so what does xavier learn about relationships nothing positive in place of a conventionally happy ending there is a regrettably portentous finale about Â xavier has all the friends he made nevertheless this highly enjoyable film deserves its great success i saw it in luxembourg with a mixed euro audience who enjoyed themselves hugely and even applauded at the end
<START> this film isn't a comedy its an expose i've always hated dog shows considering the ridiculous get ups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them hence the reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this film i get a kick out of something being taken so seriously even though the gains are small and insignificant it's like miniature golf or jump championships or the need to set some obscure world record the acting was much more refined in this film than waiting for guffman and its mainly due to the more fluidity of the characters who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than the previous eugene levy was great as was michael and fred willard however it was the dogs who eventually stole the show but then again who wants to see a bunch of humans in a film about dogs anyway
<START> el padrino the latin godfather while this seems to be a straight to dvd video type movie my copy obviously looked cropped so maybe this flick had a limited theatrical run and the title character appears to more of a gringo than moi i am half pretty typical rise and fall of a movie with the a list of b list actors robert wagner drug lawyer kathleen quinlan crusading judge tiny lister mob enforcer gary busey child rapist brad dourif white power jailbird stacey keach bereaved governor pacula bereaved milf faye dunaway crusading lawyer and make as an uncredited party guest this movie is pretty lame i only watched it to kill time before the skins game the only thing that saved it was jennifer tilly as a crazed latina drug dealing assassin she was over the top and sexy skanky that it was fun to watch her scenes not worth renting or seeking out d
<START> this is what happens when a franchise gets lazy and no one can think of a new twist to add remember what happened to the childs play series the first three were played as horror films with genuine scares albeit predictable that held true to the theme of the movie then they ran out of folks for the doll to stalk and decided to play it for laughs with the next two being black comedies br br well that s what happened here but i think it was not meant to be like that kind of like saying i wanted to make pancakes for dessert i did this on purpose when your soufflÃ© accidentally fizzles flat but the milk was spilled and it had some value in the theaters as a goof br br when the floor ripped out from under the passenger seats i sort of expected the passengers to extend their legs through the hole start running flintstones style to safely land the plane in the alps i did it would have fit into the silly campy theme of the rest of the show br br instead of pointing out the obvious physical impossibilities of the film what about the social implausibilities like having george kennedy's character react calmly to the news that his date was a whore even back in 1979 a man would not easily accept the notion that he has just poured his heart out to a paid companion he supposedly felt he made a connection with a kindred spirit who is subsequently shown to be a mercenary sex worker with a come on line who wouldn't feel cheated by the experience and yet he giggles and wraps his arms around his buddy's waist as they merrily stroll off what a cheap wrap up of a sleazy scene ouch br br i had an appetite for soufflÃ© and got served insipid clichÃ© pancakes and no you did not do it on purpose
<START> heath ledgers acting in this film really bugs me but overall its a great watch bryan brown is excellent when i dont normally like him but then his whole gang are a great piece of work jimmy is a hapless wannabe gangster who cant seem to do a thing right spoilers loses money car and nearly bumbles a bank robbery but still comes out on top br br didnt know what the two kids were in it for at the start but they ties some storylines together nicely br br all in all a damn fine piece of australian cinema 9 10
<START> a classic late 50's film the superannuated headliners joan crawford and louis jordan are not at their best but the direction cinematography and acting of the younger cast are compelling in a 50's sense which i love br br the look and feel of the artsy over artsy contemporary film far from heaven reflects exactly this sort of film and i suspect this film may be one of the models a silly plot of course hey it's 1959 but as a film glorious as a reflection of the society extremely interesting and as witness to how hollywood breaks away from the idealistic portrayal of american sexual mores fascinating
<START> many movies try to take universal themes and make a comedy but few will rise to the occasion like checking out the movie is brilliant the dialogue is well written and true to form the acting is absolutely prima peter falk has given a truly great performance as an actor as an actor he is able to carry the cast to greatness another great performance is given by laura san giacomo she is such an intriguing actress her performances take one by surprise she delivers no matter what role she is asked to give from wacko in stephen king's the stand to her television performances however checking out allows her to shine it is a role she is meant to play the film is brilliantly directed by jeff hare he was able to bring out the best in his cast and his direction in every aspect made the film a wonderful treasure jeff hare was able to make a difficult theme laughable and yet profound he gives us an up close and personal look at why indie films need to be made the directors knowledge of his cast and script are extended to the finished film the results are superb br br hopefully it will be made available to large audiences because this is one you won't want to miss it has the potential of being the sleeper hit of 2005 in the fashion of my big fat greek wedding
