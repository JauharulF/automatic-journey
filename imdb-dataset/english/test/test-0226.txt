<START> br br my favorite science fiction incredible ride through mistrust and the warping of reality probably the best performance i have ever seen jude law play incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story line that twists and turns so rapidly that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to fully grasps its genius even more fun watching it again for the end changes the beginning
<START> i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film its not because of money spent on it that's for sure did i see a painted water pistol in there maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the scotland or maybe they just didn't have any money the making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds awesome but what i really liked was the grit of the performances mike michell and patrick white play the lead parts like 2 normal guys no hollywood histrionics here br br ok so the effects work isn't very good the spaceships just don't look as good as they should in todays fx world and i've seen much better free stuff on youtube but the film holds together very well once they get to the planet was this filmed in scotland or just by a scottish crew or is it just better effects work did they edit out the water by the end i kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died
<START> i read about this film on line and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received and viewing the trailer i decided to check it out for myself what a disappointment it starts out well enough the opening scene was actually pretty tense but from there it's all downhill i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it those choices combined with the c s i editing use of music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag this film down there's too much foreshadowing and to many subtle clues so when the first twist arrives early on you already know how the movie is going to end i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job other than that i can't recommend this movie
<START> the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in people come looking for a b grade horror film or a so bad it's good movie jack frost 2 is neither of these br br it is to put it simply a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy easily funnier than all three absolutely scary movies combined is to the movie on a basic level it would be like watching shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions br br the premise is simple the characters from the first movie haunted by memories of jack frost take a vacation to a tropical island a new improved jack comes after them now with essentially the powers of hydro man from spider man essentially he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly divide himself multiply himself and worst of all he's managed to grow an immunity to his only former weakness antifreeze br br what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost a simply horrible movie can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre br br most of the entertainment comes the live action actors who serve admirably particularly funny among them are ray playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early 1900s christopher allport offering an insane hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film and david allen brooks taking the once serious role of manners to new totally bizarre heights br br the lack of memorable quotes disturbs me br br as a horror movie jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman rates a zero but you have to understand it's not a horror movie
<START> oh there are many worse wayne movies this movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that makes watching it enjoyable the villain is an anglo actor who sports ridiculous mexican clothes and affects an over the top mexican accent which is hilarious the girl is dressed like a jean harlow wannabe this is 1934 after all at least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable br br watch it and laugh don't expect a serious western but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting but occasional flashes of camp humor wayne is almost ludicrously young and handsome and one can see his acting ability blossomed years after this regrettable venture
<START> i don't see the point it's ponderous the animated people are creepy look up uncanny valley scenes go on and on and on for very little purpose the plot is skeletal and must be padded out with lots of meaningless dramatic screaming roller coaster rides as if disney or spielberg were planning an amusement park ride based on the movie most of the characters are annoying and unlikeable some of them keep showing up as if they will have something important to add to a climactic scene they don't they just vanish with no lasting impact somebody summed it up as if you don't believe in santa claus you'll be kidnapped on a train on christmas eve that pretty much sums it up
<START> another son of sam is definitely not an oscar winner technically it's horrible the acting is not too good either but there is something about it that makes you want to watch more sort of like a car wreck the ridiculous close ups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything if you are looking for a scare this ain't the flick for you it's very obscure and nearly impossible to find i'm sure there's a reason for that for a while it was titled hostage it don't matter what you call it it's still a poor choice for entertainment it might be good for a mst3000 party or something can you believe they would use such a title as another son of sam if that don't have exploitation written all over it i'll eat my hat i remember when this was shot in belmont nc a lot of local personalities were used as talent
<START> if you are a six year old boy who's into dinosaurs you will love this movie if you are anybody else you'll be rolling your eyes about every 15 seconds if you want to start picking on things like the acting the special effects the dialogue or the absence of a coherent plot that makes even the slightest amount of sense you'll have plenty of material if all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your kid it will do just fine that said there's a lot of kids' entertainment out there that's much smarter and some of it is even bearable or enjoyable for adults unless your child is in an uncompromising dinosaur mood you're probably better off looking for something else
<START> celebrity singers have always had a tough time breaking into the movies the cinema is littered with failed attempts and one can go on and on speculating why john never made it big as an actor instead of taking small parts in heartfelt projects dives right in playing the lead in falling from grace which he also directed and the results are as awkward and unbecoming as that title story of a famous singer returning to his hometown in the sticks opening up old family wounds boasts a screenplay by larry but the meandering film goes nowhere slowly the supporting cast is decent including kay lenz whom it's always nice to see mariel hemingway and claude akins who share the one really strong scene in the picture as for john's acting he doesn't look particularly comfortable despite apparent efforts to make him look at home he seems to be ducking the camera most of the time and he never connects with the audience in an immediate way 1 2 from
<START> comedy is a hard beast to conquer fails on all accounts as a writer and director some things like making movies that are funny just need to be left to the professionals 1 out of 10 awful it wasn't funny i tried to laugh but it just wasn't funny i wasn't the only one no one else at the chicago festival was laughing either at least at the showing i saw simply very bad sorry
<START> this is a very famous ninja movie but it isn't a nice movie if you want to see some ninjas and some figures want to know some things about ninjas see this movie this movie only for ninja fans and who wants to make nostalgia br br first 20 minutes and last 20 minutes of the movie are best you can just see ninja figures and fight in this scenes between these are below the average nearly bad as a movie acting is bad sho black ninja is the best actor in this movie frank nero is a good actor and charismatic but he cannot fight good scenario is also not good its so simple nero comes near to his best old friend from army and war he also protects him from mafia but he is having sex go to bed with his wife and his friend knows this but don't say anything to nero negative is this possible in life what a friendship br br finally this movie started a genre ninja movies also there is the ninja master sho kasugi but some fighting scenes are not realistic and not fast even with shoo this film is below the average even it is a classic
<START> this experimental silent film made in switzerland by an independent british film company is chiefly remembered as paul robeson's first film it's very artistic with shots often seeming meaningless to the story which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of enough inter titles from what i gathered robeson's wife is in an inter racial love affair with a white man called thorne it doesn't bother the cigar chomping owner of the bar hotel where thorne lives and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a barmaid but an old lady expresses the town's point of view in an inter title if i had my way we wouldn't allow negroes in here thorne is also called lover by someone in the bar tries a reconciliation with pete robeson but eventually leaves him wife astrid goes off the deep end brandishes a knife cuts arm and cheek and somehow dies thorne must have been accused of murder because we learn he was acquitted as for pete he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it is best for everyone that he leave town so the film is more about racism than anything but in an up note the owner tells pete the sad thing is they think they're right that's the way we are the meaning of the title is a mystery it may refer to being light skinned a borderline negro or to the borderline behavior of of the main characters
<START> i watched this one mostly to see charlie and una merkel two of my favorites br br the plot has many a twist and turn it's not bad as a straight mystery aboard a train br br but why throw in a circus train wreck and an escaped gorilla i can mention this without it being a spoiler because the circus train wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate mystery plot br br the bad person trying to kill the good people has many tricks up his sleeve but the circus train wreck was purely coincidental it allows for a single scene with a menacing gorilla but then it's back to the murder mystery
<START> as ben elton once observed nothing goes quicker out of style than comedy steve martin's latest offering 'the pink panther 2' recently opened to bad reviews and dismal box office while mike myers' 'the love seems to have won few admirers br br in 1970 it was jerry lewis' turn to feel the pain of rejection ironically his character in this film experiences a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence when 'which way to the front ' effectively drove him off the big screen for almost a decade br br in this world war two comedy he plays byers the richest man in the world who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty and also because he is bored with being successful but is rejected as he is medically unfit he then decides to start his own privately funded army recruiting other 4 f's br br decked out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by rescue' in 'thunderbirds' they go into training some good visual gags here when they fire rocket launchers they look pleased with themselves until they learn they have just destroyed a oil station wishing to learn german brendan plays a long playing record called to mein kampf by' when this army sits down to eat instead of being in a mess hall they are in an opulent room decked out with a chandelier br br john wood is very funny as byers' ever so english butler his best scene is when he blackmails a mafia type gangster into teaching byers' brigade to kill br br the script was not by jerry himself but by gerald gardiner and dee caruso author of a number of episodes of 'the often has the look and feel of a television sitcom indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laugh track br br where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when byers replaces a top nazi commander and after ordering the germans to withdraw from the front gets involved in the plot to kill hitler and tom cruise is nowhere in sight as the commander jerry delivers a performance of such mind numbing ineptitude as to defy description he gives brian blessed a run for his money in the man alive' stakes it comes as a relief when the end credits appear br br perhaps the timing was just wrong bringing out a war comedy when the vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea or the public simply had had enough of jerry that beard probably did not help what he needed here was a good producer someone to take him in hand and say that gag stinks throw it out 'don't raise the bridge lower the river' is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture br br as the '70's got underway the new comedy icons would be woody allen mel brooks and monty python fresher more biting and in allen's case more human styles of comedy replaced jerry's brand of slapstick it would not be until 1982 that he would make anything like a successful comeback as the conceited talk show host in martin scorcese's brilliant 'the king of comedy'
<START> chop shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters i cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie this film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like br br this film is about a young boy alejandro ale who works and lives with his teenage sister in a one room tiny loft in an auto shop the story takes place in a part of new york city that i did not even know existed points where there are endless and body shops here tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to support themselves by buying and fixing up a food van br br ale makes money helping at the auto shop and helps at a food van both however earn extra money on the side ale sells bootleg movies and stolen car parts results to selling herself their lives are surrounded by grit and grim but even though both witness live and barely survive within their harsh world their love for each other is never tainted by the filth that surround them and occasionally they are able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood that is being stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and stay together br br the best comparison i have for chop shop is that juxtaposition of an innocent love between family members against such a bleak atmosphere is as powerful as pasolini's mama roma combined with the struggles of growing up too fast in an adverse environment just as in bresson's br br having co written directed and edited both this film and his first man push cart which won awards all over the world is a total package filmmaker br br i can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures for long
