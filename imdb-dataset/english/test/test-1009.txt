<START> very memorable comedy it's fun to watch the many situations develop and finally converge after a long journey on that greatest collection of eclectic humanity and the world's largest honky tonk the great american freeway like mad mad world it's got loads of contemporary talent old boy politics good comedic action and dialog unlike that one it is the target that seeks not the unwitting seekers they have no idea what they really want as they drift along america's great road nor does it carry the weight of having a great fall guy who is saved only in the end by a great belly laugh but the ending stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent film editing humor and timing and the big city bank scene is hilarious with very original acting by one very talented character in particular the total aplomb of the city dwellers in the face of chaos leaves one feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling the slapstick is funny but honky tonk freeway deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuance and character reactions that are easily missed all in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are good or bad and the goofy situations we find ourselves in it was just meant to be funny and it is

<START> since i am required to write minimum of 10 lines and this garbage deserves not only a single one i'll start with the following 1 i voted awful for this dreadful so called movie br br 2 let me explain why these turkeys mr david produces are shot mainly in my beautiful homeland bulgaria just in btw for the illiterate people around this country is in europe based north to greece and has absolutely nothing to do with mexico and uruguay some years ago nu image has invaded our country and started making crappy mostly direct to video releases why here because here they pay derisively low fees to the bulgarian crew and to the bulgarian actors most of them distinguished ones which are in many ways better than most of their american colleagues personally i am ashamed of that fact the reason is of course the of the americans involved and their wish to get most if not all of the profit actually it would't be so bad if only the production wasn't so filthy and pale there hasn't been a good picture shot here for years at present nu image is being sued here over the very questionably purchasing of our national cinema production centre called films no doubt about it there has been corruption there has been deceit there has been a lies in this recent purchase the bulgarian cinema is dead long live the bulgarian cinema
<START> i have been feeling a little disappointed by tarantino ever since death proof but i insist it was only a little because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people inglorious basterds has definitely propelled tarantino to the top ranks in my universe this movie can be summed up albeit inadequately in one word raw br br there is an intense emotion in every scene revenge and justice seem to be the main themes from the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the nazis and is placed in tarantino's fictional dimension of the ww2 historical context br br characters are fun scary brutal sexy and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive i won't go in to an appreciation of each character but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances br br dialogue has evolved from the classic tarantino bad ass provocative style as seen in pulp fiction and death proof one can feel in the dialogues that tarantino is making more open references to other movies indeed many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere a reference to a movie is close around every corner br br it is nice to see that each language presented german french and english is employed rather equally and naturally i speak both french and english very fluently and am frequently disappointed in how english speaking characters in french movies act poorly and how french speaking characters in english american movies act poorly amazingly enough tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors it helps put the audience in context of the historical context indeed soldiers spies and rarely understood soldiers spies civilians from other countries br br the visuals photography are beautiful with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s wwii europe the outfits are perfect and the violence realistically conveyed no punches are held back and the nazis are often shown being tortured this makes the movie not open to all audiences the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic br br volumes can be written about this movie but the movie is so good that during the north american inglorious basterds premiere at the fantasia festival in montreal i had to pee but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene i hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie and i'm a hard audience to please
<START> this movie doesn't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good it is truly appalling its closer to a tongue in cheek parody than a disaster movie but alas they were serious made for tv but not worthy of even that it contains every clichÃ© and cheesy plot moment you can imagine oh will he save the town from the flood will his wife admit that she still loves him will they escape before the flood drowns them i cant explain how bad this is awful predictable plot that makes you wince it is so cheesy bad effects although to be fair i have seen worse super imposed bubbling water bad script woeful acting hideous so bad in fact that you probably should get drunk and watch it
<START> this is a bewildering absurdist short a miller dressed in white makes his way towards us from a windmill in a desolate landscape although the image is pared down there is an obvious logic here however he is stopped by the sweep all in black because of his work they start each other for no particular reason did the snooty miller insult the sooty sweep is this class war br br whatever he pelts his adversary with bags of grain which fly all over the fight making redundant everything he had done prior to the fight making redundant the windmill so that all becomes as pointless as the fight the miller's grain the blackness later westerns wouldn't be so subtle heroes and villains being colour coded is there a racial tint here br br if this wasn't marvellous enough the fighters are chased off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere an appropriately kafkaesque ending to an odd story or are they just the social conscience rising up against a fight that negates order and purpose and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema this mix of comedy surrealism and the absurd is an obvious forerunner for buster keaton while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers hitchcock's 'foreign
<START> sam o'steen the film editor on the superlative suspense flick rosemary's baby from 1968 here directs a quickie tv made sequel one in which rosemary woodhouse patty duke astin in for mia farrow is shunted off early and inexplicably presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about satan's son on earth most interesting is the return of ruth gordon to her oscar winning role as minnie with ray milland well cast as her husband roman but she isn't given much to do and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway this script is strictly low rent goods and must have shamed original author ira levin who went on to write his own sequel fairly dim and pallid with poor photography and no suspense or scares whatsoever
<START> there are just so many things wrong with this movie br br jeff bridges weird accent br br rita's ability to crack the password code br br the entire script br br the ending esp the last scene when two coffees are brought to the table for jeff and rita and the publisher j r laugh and say we don t drink coffee anymore well why did they order it then they obviously did if they didn't and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default there would have been three coffees br br total tosh
<START> perhaps once in a generation a film comes along that is perfection for me the railway children is that film a timeless classic that was directed and performed most beautifully it depicts all that is worthwhile in humanity and climaxes in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice every performance is a gem though bobbie stands out and like judy garland as dorothy before her jenny agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine anyone else in the role br br the world is all the better for this film and the children of today would be much the better for watching it br br of course like so many young men of my generation i fell hopelessly in love with jenny agutter and her hold was as strong when i had the great good fortune to meet her a few days ago the bewitching smile and voice like dripping honey were still there to send me weak at the knees as they first did all those years ago
<START> i love this movie so much it always makes me cry if you appreciate drew barrymore half as much as i do you'll love this movie it's got all the essentials i look for in a movie it has good actors good characters good humor a lot of heart warming moments too the flash back moments when we see josie in high school make me cry though every single time i'm sure you'll like this one don't judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie even though it is in a way a teen movie sure if you're a guy and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time then this isn't for you but if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it pick it up at a video store and enjoy drew barrymore is great in this one
<START> i tell you although it is funny how how this many swear words are in this one i'm sure the number of profanities and swear words in it would probably count up to about 200 because from what i last heard the greatest number of swear words on a south park episode is 165 counts of the word s t but aside from that its so funny because in it there is swear words and also shooting themselves in the head watch this for your own survival also look out for a mention of cartmans father and also the annoying voice of chris and also kyle has to save cartman from the catch a predator show is also on dateline and they track a down and when they got there the shot himself
<START> with a cast like this i knew the acting would be amazing still i was cautious as i always am of sequels would it sustain the feeling of the first film could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of ocean's 11 we'll never know because they didn't try at least not in the way i expected instead they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre if you want a gripping logical heist don't watch this if you want a good laugh with witty dialogue quirky characters and an absolutely genius scene where julia roberts has to impersonate herself then you'll love ocean's 12
<START> man what an awful film as with many terrible films the structure of its awfulness lies in the script this is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives the entire genre a bad name okay here's one major problem sandra bullock's character is abducted by jeff bridges in his car at a busy convenience store in broad daylight somehow her boyfriend kiefer sutherland doesn't find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the movie completely clueless as to her whereabouts come on personally i find this completely insulting to even the of audience members yet we are forced to buy into this nonsense of equal frustration is the poorly explained motive for jeff actions his character is a bit of an eccentric academic to be sure but far from the sociopath who would do these things he goes through about ten minutes give or take spilling his beans to sutherland as to why he has performed his cruel actions but the explanation itself lacks even the most elementary sense of logic therefore no intelligent audience member can really believe in the possibility of his evil and if you subtract that element from the story the entire thing falls apart br br also of major concern jeff bridges using a weird pseudo french accent for no reason br br the entire boring subplot involving nancy travis most especially her saving the day by turning the tables on bridges br br the crazy woman who somehow manages to remember jeff bridges' license plate number despite also thinking that the lucky charms leprechaun is real br br sandra bullock's character's name diane conveniently re scrambles to form the word vanished are you friggin' kidding me the logistical impossibility of drugging abducting and burying in a very remote location a human being within the span of forty minutes as bridges specifically alludes to br br this is a movie that made me remember the fictional impossibly stupid yet very successful donald kaufman character in adaptation many screenwriters are brilliant inspired artists some are just bozos who convince the nitwits running the studios to make their drivel this particular script is so stunningly dimwitted that donald kaufman himself would have managed to sell it unfortunately for all of us in the real world todd graff actually did
<START> everyone agrees about the technical excellence of this film by jutra whose life ended short so tragically as for the content of course it makes a difference if you're a and this explains some of the divergence of opinions for me it is to cinema what mon pays ce pas un pays is to song in addition jean was himself a part of legendary quebec br br this film can be contrasted with crazy a current quebec release that is successful enough to be showing here in spain and is also about the 1960s urban quebec crazy vs rural quebec antoine but also a film that must be something very different for foreigners and for people who know quebec from the inside
