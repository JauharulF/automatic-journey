<START> i found this movie to be mostly a p o s it was low budget but that isn't the problem the problem is the movie is just lame it doesn't really make a lot of sense yes it does explain why things happened but that's not what i mean there was just no reason for it all the movie also moved very slow the last ice age was quicker than this also i think they went overboard a bit in the kills i don't mean they were too gross but the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the head or stabbing his victim maybe i'm being petty but i just didn't like the movie the whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of when a stranger calls and maybe that was the whole point but so what for me when a stranger kills is a 4 10
<START> this film was sourced from my friends mum who worked in a charity shop she gave it to us along with a load of other unknown cassette tapes the film itself is a bit rubbish there are a few notable bits to laugh at like the bit when his girlfriend gets her head drilled into but in general the film is bland when i saw the trailer for the island i couldn't help noticing the similarities may have been the inspiration for that film all in all don't bother watching this film as it is dull and boring we enjoyed it so much when we were 16 that we named our band after it another sign this film is a bit crappy is the shots on the back of the video case don't actually appear in the film weird
<START> the midnight hour aka tell me no lies as found in some video stores can be judged in two different ways one by it's merritt as a movie complete with a plot no holes good story and believable conclusion and the other is by the skin flick it is trying to be this is certainly no more than a b movie skin flick whose sole purpose is to show every girl in the movie in an overly long sex scene at least once br br if you try to rate this as a regular movie then this is bottom of the line drivel huge plot holes ruin whatever storyline it has going for it for instance if a co worker is killed would you call the police or head home and hit the hot tub judging this movie by it's skin content it's watchable barely the girls for the most part are all beautiful but quite obviously enhanced the sex scenes were all long and overdone though and that made it's only redeeming quality a little boring br br amber smith could probably be a decent actress if she wanted she was not as horrible as you could imagine or maybe next to the rest of the cast she seemed a lot better than she was br br zoe anderson who played detective should not even be watching a movie much less acting in one she looked good though so we know why she was there br br overall i would not really recommend this to anyone even if you're looking for a good skin flick there are much better one's out there i rate this 4 out of 10
<START> it's as if this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head ' patti br br patti christina ricci is a sarcastic teenaged girl bored with her all too average little town bored that is until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues to the poor lady's whereabouts now with the help of her precious cat d c ' and an inept fbi agent doug e doug she must find her br br that darn cat is a bad movie it is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat there are however a few buds of talent in it doug e doug was good in cool his performance as was really funny here he is wasted as the bumbling fbi agent he does have a good scene when he imitates the cat though micheal plays patti's father his character must be the most understanding parent to ever live this poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed gets arrested for picking up his own cat and gets bitched at by his snippy wife and still doesn't get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles i wish my old man was like that the only real good performance is christina ricci's she entertaining as the ever annoyed patti but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down you might also recognize peter boyle young frankenstein everybody loves raymond the old lady from wings and cliff from cheers in this movie this is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget even the cat isn't very good i really can't recommend 1997's that darn cat some young children under 8 might enjoy it a bit but every one else should look elsewhere if you're looking for a good christina ricci movie i suggest addams family values the opposite of sex or sleepy hollow if a fun family film is what you're after try snow day instead br br
<START> one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun exciting for the cast and crew i could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm dedication because they apparently liked the people involved br br i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart and i think this is one such work the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress director and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent watchable piece of art br br the critiques of this film that more or less say why not just rent a hardcore porn movie make the point as to why they didn't like the film going to this film hoping for a lot of t a without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn i think she graduated br br in terms of the writing the dialog is not a huge part of the movie like in a tarentino film but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure with the villianess heroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings br br i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride br br gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot not just airhead bimbos so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art even with the limits of b movie land not disappointing
<START> earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust well parts of the earth because somewhere in italy a band of survivors those without radioactive contamination are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood the final executioner is the story of one of their would be victims alan william who looks not surprisingly a lot like kurt russell and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters who are led by marina costa and erasmus harrison muller jr alan has been trained to kill by former nypd cop sam woody strode who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat strode is by far the best thing about the film though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time as for the story it's a blending of elements from better films and stories including ten little indians the most dangerous game and escape from new york the final executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans
<START> i found the movie very interesting i really enjoyed the film the actors were great it was entertainment benny the uncle was wonderful he was real at his character the ending took a wonderful twist i would recommend you seeing it eddie mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail i also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in brooklyn i loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol i actually watched the movie 2 times and learned more the second time
<START> i can't believe i actually spent almost three hours of my life watching this this must be one of the most unbelievable predictable and cheesy television movies i have seen in a long time i was hoping for some good special effects and action instead i spent the entire time rolling my eyes and yelling oh come on at the screen the dialog is shallow and obvious the acting strained at times and as the story moves along isn't it just funny how everything happens at the same time not to mention the obvious and nauseating ending now i've seen more than my share of disaster movies i am a big fan actually and think that often they can pull off completely unrealistic stuff as long as it's done in a fun way but this is definitely not it this is just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere what were they thinking when they made this movie
<START> 1921 a classic film with cult status amongst the silent movies directed by victor who also plays the male main role is based on a story by swedish novelist selma the film tells the story of brutal drinker david holm who beats up his wife neglects his children seduces his brother to drinking and is blind for the love of nurse edit astrid holm david sits toward the end of the year together with his boozing buddies in the city park and tells the story of the phantom chariot who dies in the new year's eve night as the last one before dawn has to serve one year long as driver of death and release the dying souls from their bodies but david gets into a fight with his buddies suffers a hemorrhage and sinks dead on the soil meanwhile the phantom carriage is approaching the driver is nobody else than david's late friend georges who seduced him into alcohol and died one year before since david refuses to get on the carriage georges forces him together they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from david they visit the nurse edit whose love to david he was unable to recognize and whom he infected with tuberculosis so that she is dying now but her love to david will save his soul fulfilled with her spirit they get to david's wife and children david is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children because she does not see a way out of the misery in which david has thrown her they also visit david's brother who has committed a murder after having been seduced into drinking by david david asks georges to go back into his body because he finally sees that his way was wrong since it was georges who had seduced him once into drinking david's wish is granted he gets a second chance and georges has to be one more year the driver of the phantom carriage in order to pay for his own sins this movie belongs probably to the strongest and most impressive films ever made deplorably it is still not available on international dvd
<START> a delightful and wonderful film which has entered my pantheon of great romantic comedies in many ways it's even better than when harry met sally it wears well on viewing and re viewing the cast is excellent and both david duchovny and minnie driver give us really believable characters
<START> i watched this movie only because i didn't want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater by themselves honestly i went in expecting to enjoy a good nap but found myself entranced by the movie i'd recommend it to anyone who asks roy's mom was on one of my all time favorite tv shows years ago playing a mermaid maximum bob she was really cute in this movie the three main characters were all excellent young actors also enjoyed seeing and hearing jimmy buffet the movie itself was quite beautiful showcasing some of what makes florida so great i'm glad i ended up going to this movie and to think i was disappointed that i couldn't take them to see stick it i think this was much better
<START> i can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic i'm a million miles from being an expert and i'm never going to climb a mountain but even the very basic knowledge attained from reading into thin air and watching everest beyond the limit and a few other everest docs meant that this film just got more and more ridiculous as it went on there is some good climbing footage at the start and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film how much experience above 8000 metres do you have i was encouraged to hope that this might be a gritty and accurate man vs nature odyssey instead you have a bunch of climbers zooming up a mountain with no climbing with goggles off in full sun and they are barely ever out of breath performing miraculous feats of endurance only near the summit is a little fatigue suggested to dramatically accentuate the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak almost as an afterthought if you have no knowledge of mountaineering give it a look be prepared for some clichÃ©d heroics although no more clichÃ©d than a hundred other passably diverting flicks and a clichÃ©d outcome i've been developing a minor fascination with high mountains and was looking forward to watching but other than some amazingly beautiful scenery it was a let down because it was so far removed from reality i can imagine some experts being employed in the making of this movie but then being conveniently ignored in the pursuit of the heroic and sadly fantastical storyline also you would sound like a bit of a tit if you said welcome to the death zone at feet
<START> truly i love lucy as well comedic genius yes mame never she was as ridiculous as mame as was the film adaptation of divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood both just completely missed the point russell was is and always will be the first and only mame perhaps as a young starlet ball could have pulled off a role like this where her inherent beauty and youth could have carried her through but this seemed a desperate attempt from an aged star to show that she was still viable in the field the reason there are sooo many more supporters of russell's version aside from the fact that you cant improve upon the original is that russell had presence she absorbs every scene whereas lucille ball might as well be a pattern on the wallpaper in mame for all the attention she commands in the role
<START> i saw this movie a while ago and i was looking forward to it my biggest problem was having seen the trailer i was expecting a very stylish marshal arts movie with plenty of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about along the way i was sorely disappointed as it would seem that once you have seen the trailer there is nothing else worth watching if what you are expecting is as described above my girlfriend at the time gave up half way through and whilst i continued to watch in the hope that something interesting might happen nothing did i found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters i would say just don't bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you don't really care about losing
<START> jack frost 2 is probably the most cheesiest movie i have ever seen in my life the complete title of the film is jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines will be delighted to watch this this film was straight to video and for good reasons here's why the acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could cause one to cry the main character had no personality and the actor's bad acting made it all worse the screenplay was was also atrocious each character always says a cheesy line and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography then you have something bad second the story line isn't really all that impressive but since this movie was straight to video it is forgiven the director and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman into something cool but they didn't they story has lots of plot holes in it in the beginning a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank with the melted jack frost scientists try to restore his life but they couldn't once the cup of coffee fell into the tank jack frost was completely restored now he is immune to anti freeze in jack frost part 1 the main character's dna got mixed up with the anti freeze that was used to kill jack frost since the main character is allergic to bananas jack frost is too hence here's my point they say that sam's dna combined with jack frost's but one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup so when it fell into the tank the scientists dna would have been combined with jack another thing the special effects weren't very good either here's the good points jack frost 2 has lots of blood that looks pretty realistic even though this movie is flawed to hell it is still entertaining overall jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie the first one was better though 7 out of 10
