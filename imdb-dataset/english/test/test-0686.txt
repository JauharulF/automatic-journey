<START> universal studios the name conjures up so many memories to horror fans of beautiful matte paintings er landscapes fog enshrouded full moons howling wolves taverns and torch wielding mobs yet it is quite strange looking back on those films how little the era which produced the true classics lasted the '30's had it's masterpieces but those were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today the '40's produced more mindlessly fun matinÃ©e films than it did high art and most fans agree that the classic era of the gothic horror films ended in 1945 with 'house of bumped around with the abbott costello comedies and was officially dead by the 50's and the coming of the atomic age br br so it's strange that perhaps one of universal's finest was made in the '50s that alone makes the film an oddity since costume dramas were on their way out everywhere it may not be comparable to the all time classics like the james whale films and 'the but damn does it condense all the fun elements of those films into one delicious treat get ready for nothing but pure entertainment since various social mores had changed the film also indulges in violence that would not have been allowed in earlier eras there's no blood but we see characters shot and stabbed directly and there's even a burning torch to the face br br the film may not really be a horror film but it sure has the atmosphere look and feel of one it begins in the dead of night with howling winds and wolves as two men seal the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers but wait one of them is not dead but he can't move he's trapped but talking silently in his own mind unable to communicate what is his story now that is how you start a horror film br br english businessman sir ronald burton richard greene giving one of his best performances sets out under the alias of richard beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of one eyed austrian count von bruno did sacha baron cohen see this it seems many years ago von bruno posed as a god to the natives in africa to steal ivory he was exposed by burton's men and the natives disfigured him now he is lusting for revenge br br the film has all the clichÃ©s a jonathan harker style ride to the castle an inn full of wary villagers death traps and a hulking manservant lon chaney jr the torture chamber scenes are genuinely suspenseful including a panel in the floor that activates a dungeon door which makes for an ingenious getaway scene later on a hunting expedition involving an imported panther and even an alligator pit and then there's the romeo juliet style fake death that leads to the film's prologue br br the plot is clichÃ© and the world view is black and white but it's still incredibly entertaining with director nathan making every scene pile on the atmosphere and seem fresh and new there are several plot holes too why does ronald attempt to leave the castle so early and he never does solve the mystery of what happened to his friends even though it's obvious but he doesn't know that when he gives up and he seemed so sure earlier weird br br all of the actors are great despite being a rude richard greene makes burton one of the most likable protagonists i've ever seen in a horror film rita is excellent as the count's wife' who becomes burton's love interest she may have the stereotypical in love with just a problem of all film heroines of this era but her portrayal of a long suffering woman in a loveless marriage to a sadistic monster is very convincing she also shows a suspicion and wit few film heroines of this era do even seeing a forced attempt by burton to quiet her and to paw at her necklace although it is simply to analyze it as it has an important clue as a rape attempt yet she never seems nasty in her paranoia the audience sympathizes with her even though he fails to make von bruno seem truly foreign and otherworldly he is a villain in a horror film after all stephen mcnally gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic nobleman when he reveals his burnt eye and laughs maniacally it is truly scary lon chaney jr is also great as his mute henchman br br but the best performance is undeniably by boris karloff as the mysterious physician dr he has little screen time at first but steals every scene he is in it is a performance that is both creepy sad mysterious and ultimately heroic as he leers evilly as he applies leeches to one of bruno's henchman spies on our hero and speaks in that famous 'you know i'm up to no good' voice only karloff could make you wonder whether if he is a hero or villain always skulking about and although he does function as the main agent of our hero's escape he still shows human frailties such as greed and for his own life even cold bloodedly poisoning a man for burton's benefit before he even gets burton to agree his plan to help our hero heroine escape also puts them directly in the clutches of von bruno as he arranges an amazingly sadistic if unbelievably flawed death for them that had to have inspired similar scenes in corman's poe series he may not have much screen time but this is easily one of best performances br br while the ending may seem abrupt and anti climatic for some half the fun is getting there and there's much excitement to be had kick back and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains it's no masterpiece but it's escapist fun at it's best
<START> may contain spoilers but of course it does not matter br br battleship potemkin is one stunning spectacle of haunting images the visual direction is well and has been inspiring the sheer scale of the film is impressive and the technique is certainly pioneering what is really amazing is to my mind the depth and effectiveness of a film devoid of proper literary script sound save the soundtrack decent image quality the faux profound self of today exceptional acting pretense etc what you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered br br btw the previous poster noted felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted the problem is that you think eisenstein is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you it's a little cheap i would've rather seen a huge final action scene br br i must warn you that the end is not cheap and eisenstein wasn't being generous to the heroes history however was potemkin really did go through the squadron as it was shown in the film br br finally i'd strongly recommend seeing battleship potemkin to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema see it with a fellow movie buff it kept me talking for hours however if you tend to consider films generally accepted as great or classic to be slow or boring this film might not be for you yet not much cheap entertainment here br br for me though it is a full 10 10
<START> i read a viciously hidden remarks on a previous comments stating that this film showed a bunch of gay guys romping around their gayness br br this couldn't be more misleading eighteen is not a gay film it has only three gay characters in it and one of them is the victim of prejudice of people like the one who wrote the comments despite his confession of fairness br br grandfather was not gay the tender scene of the soldier and his sergeant is male bonding at the crucial moment of death but some people gets appalled by a kiss and welcome scene of guts flying out of a man killed by a bomb br br the focus of the film is the straight relationship of pip and that sweet girl and their facing their social obligation and parenthood br br ralph www info
<START> mickey rooney as mi taylor is a young man drifting along the figurative road to ruin where he meets 12 year old elizabeth taylor as velvet brown she adores horses but he has a sad history with the animals ms taylor is enamored with mr rooney's horse sense she takes him home and gets him room and board with her family they are supported very well by anne revere and donald crisp as mr and mrs brown butch jenkins and angela lansbury are taylor's strained siblings br br the plot of national velvet is implausible to a fault for example the circumstances leading to taylor's ride in the big race are quite a stretch but were likely more believable on paper still the characters' connection to horses and to ms revere's character are nicely conceived rooney and taylor are excellent in the starring roles there is a balance between rooney's fading child star and taylor's exuberant new child star which adds depth to their characterizations br br the excellent performances of rooney and taylor are further enhanced by fine direction photography and editing from clarence brown leonard smith and robert kern a sentimental classic br br national velvet 12 14 44 clarence brown mickey rooney elizabeth taylor anne revere
<START> my favorite show of all time yeah i thought this was so cool and was the first crush i ever had it was well written funny except when it it wanted to be serious and just a great show overall but since we couldn't afford to keep nick i couldn't see any episodes after feb 1996 and maybe that makes me think more of the show than i should to me it's more the epidemy now that doesn't look spelled right of having to say goodbye to someone that you love and know you'll never see them again and i still think that because as far as i know there are no plans to release this on dvd any time soon yeah life is mean i've found that out for sure though you can find an odd episode every here or there but i never liked the bootleg copies of things much either br br so enough of my sad life most kids in 7th grade don't need powers like alex gets to get them through life unrealistic for sure but then again how many towns have a super evil chemical plants that is willing to do anything for progress at any cost gee this show was fun to watch though i'd agree the is a bit over developed and even a little politically correct sometimes my favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant a video tape or something like that like a kid's version of tom rainbow six which years later i got hooked on that game series for probably the same reason almost then you've got the plant's security team who are trying desperately to find the kid from the accident very mean dudes at least when i first watched the show they seem more sympathetic to me now i feel rather sad for not sure if she minds this role type casting her but it's what i'll always remember her by br br oh and btw the actor that plays aaron from 24 is on here too as a school coach or something too cool maybe he can get the producers of that show to get in next season of 24 i only bring it up jack bauer is my other tv hero and i'd just love to see cross over things lol both are set in california so i'll just keep on i can see it now let me alone with that suspect for a few minutes no i don't need a car battery
<START> six stars for paul newman's portrayal of general negative four for the inclusion of a highly fictionalized event where the truth is well documented michael merriman did not really exist his character or at least his fate is based loosely on that of louis a canadian physicist who did not come to los until after the war he conducted his lethal tail of the dragon experiment in may 1946 this is a critical point the effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the hiroshima and nagasaki blasts had anyone died of radiation poisoning at los before the trinity test it's very possible that the scientists would have abruptly stopped their work and history would have been changed whether for the better or the worse we can only speculate someone should ask the producers and the director whether they added character for dramatic effect or to deliver an anti nuclear message for a more even handed and accurate treatment of events at los during the manhattan project see the tv movie day one or better yet read the peter book on which it is based
<START> it's been over 30 years now but i still remember that this movie was the worst i've ever seen i would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but i was mistaken i just finished watching starship troopers and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than poor cow
<START> in the aftermath of september 11th in new york this drama about american firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism the story is told with a series of flashbacks where after firefighter jack morrison joaquin phoenix has crashed through the floor of a burning building and only communicating with captain mike kennedy john travolta via the radio the flashbacks basically show how jack grows from being a recruit seeing kennedy as a father figure to being a firehouse legend of course in the present day jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him but they are too late and in the end he lets them leave him and it forwards to his funeral where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known also starring barrett as linda morrison terminator 2's robert patrick as lenny richter morris chestnut as tommy drake billy burke as dennis balthazar getty as ray and tim as tony corrigan the blazes of the film are ultimately all i could pay attention to and enjoy seeing the characters tackle them the rest is a bit too chatty for my liking adequate
<START> fires on the plain directed by kon ichikawa and written by shohei and wada is a world war two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers but the japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the philippines the main characters name is tamura played by and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick all he has on him is a hand grenade his gun and some potatoes like this he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease but since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed he begins a long walk throughout the whole movie tamura remains a bit but very civil when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade a scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is when tamura comes into a village which is completely deserted there he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church this makes tamura think and even more scared than he already is that shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly after he turns away from the corpses two a couple or brother and sister very close relationship return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back the main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first although he walked up to them with his gun but shoots the woman once she starts screaming her brother boyfriend husband then runs away in fear and after a moment tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing filipino he does not hit him after tamura picks up the bag of salt something very precious he drops his gun into a river this gesture is very important in order to understand kon shohei profiling of tamura and the war comparing this movie to other world war 2 movies it is not typical at all of course all movies have suffering heroes but their heroes are more heroic than tamura he expresses everything that is human he is getting manipulated he is weak he gets scared he has hope this is typical for japanese world war two movies and for japanese society since world war two is not a discussed theme in japanese society japanese are likely to put japanese in the second world war in the role of the victim this is also very visual in this movie one of the examples is tamura another one the piled up bodies of japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is when the japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike in my personal conclusion i have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual it also has no nationalistic propaganda which could've been easily built in once you have watched the movie fully you will be able to see the horrors of the second world war to its total extent
<START> not the funniest movie ever but i have to watch this film at least once a year just so i can fall in love with michelle johnson all over again she never looked better than she did in this film by the way the story is good too
<START> at the time that this movie was made most housewives knew exactly who barbara stanwick was parodying today only some women over 50 probably remember gladys whose column wisdom ran in family circle magazine from before world war ii until the 1970's she lived on farm in and her columns were collected into a number of books seasons etc the lines that barbara stanwick recites as she types them for her column are quite typical of the ones that began a typical gladys column besides cooking and country living she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times she talked a lot about her favorite dogs mostly cocker you might say that martha stewart is the gladys of today br br christmas is connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiece but it is pleasant lighthearted entertainment soothing to the stressed out mind and that is good enough
<START> i can't help thinking that this is franco's to the marquis de sade's one thousand days of people in this case women abducted to serve as slaves to a privileged elite check kinky sex check torture including whipping check victims chosen at random to be killed check br br thank goodness franco didn't go the whole hog and introduce cinema audiences to the delights of and indeed another perversion that crops up repeatedly in de sade's tediously long and disgusting saga br br i rather hoped that this film would fall into the 'so bad it's good' category but even the acres of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters didn't make up for the dismal dialogue dreadful acting elusive plot and just to put the tin hat on it dubbing and english sub titles a belt and braces approach missing from the women's costumes the gave a very professional performance though br br of course i could be wrong about the de sade angle after all i failed to realise that the actor playing the head warden at the was a trans sexual i must pay more attention to the size of people's hands in future br br according to another reviewer the film was banned in the uk well it clearly isn't any more though i fancy that the nipple scene was cut to satisfy the censors on the dvd i watched it was only clearly visible on the spanish trailer which in case you're wondering i watched to compare it with the english one br br the dvd also features an interview with jess franco though you'll need better spanish than mine to understand it unless i'm much mistaken it's neither dubbed nor sub titled and it points out that the person sodomising the character played by franco is wilson disguised using a moustache kind of ironic given that s he had had the requisite appendage surgically removed
<START> i first saw this in the 70s on syndicated tv and admired its production values which were high tech for the time the remastered video is rich and colorful far more intense then the pale 35 mm tv prints this movie deserves more attention it paved the way for ufo space 1999 and even star wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly conceived gadgets sure the story of an alternative anti matter planet earth has been recycled a hundred times since star trek but the beauty of this film is its self conscious european flair for design from the rolls royce space engines to the euro sec business paper or as it was called in europe is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of europe in space in the shadow of the superpowers gerry and sylvia anderson's ambitious epic gets a little tedious when the american astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppleganger earth and everything is literally downhill after the poetically graceful shuttle boarding sequence a mediocre story is helped along by a grand and lyrical classical score by the late great barry gray the john williams of britain
<START> this is the story of a news investigator who hates his job which prove why actors even as weak as tom cruise and denzel washington are on the big screen and your neighbors are not br br i'll say this though the better moments show some basis for being really funny not just wacky to keep trying maybe taking some classes and using the time to keep learning how to make a good movie dude where's my car and the scary movie sequence have it all over this college attempt br br the lighting wasn't the production wasn't and the script had moments the conversation from space very nice try unconvincingly executed this reminded me of dark star which is about being lost in space but this movie is just lost br br the talent was the bartender he said so annoyingly that i knew he had to be acting wasn't he now that's acting the mark hammond guy and marty i guess i gave the movie a point for each one of them 3 10 br br ld br br br br my faith http www angelfire com ny5 jbc33
<START> i completely understand the historical significance of x m but that doesn't make it a good movie to begin with the plot or what there is of it is dull and lifeless five astronauts blast off for the moon Â they get knocked off course and end up on mars huh Â cavemen looking martians throw rocks at them Â they return to earth and meet a fiery death Â the end believe it or not but this pithy plot description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is to make matters worse john character dr karl feels it necessary to give long drawn out speeches on everything from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons it's just a thrill a minute sarcasm intended br br looking back at x m almost 60 years later i would call the portrayal of women funny if it weren't all so sad and misguided there are a number of examples i could cite but there's one exchange of dialogue just after take off between the male chauvinist pilot floyd played by the irritating plastic haired lloyd bridges and dr lisa van horn the only female crewmember and the constant object of floyd's often creepy attention that illustrates the film's attitudes toward women quite nicely br br Â floyd i've been wondering how did a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place br br Â dr van horn i suppose you think that women should only cook and sew and bear children br br Â floyd isn't that enough br br i think floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen
