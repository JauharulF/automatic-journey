<START> lots of flames thousands of extras in battle scenes lots of beautiful sets i don't think the plot supported such a vast expenditure the story could have been told far more effectively and have been more valid psychologically if there weren't so much macho bombast in the production chinese movies tend to be this way in my experience and i think this detracts from the film
<START> i saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because i felt it was a waste of time the idea to make a film through the eyes of a one of the evil guys throughout most fantasy and medieval films is great and offers plenty of possibilities but the film couldn't catch one of them i was not feeling for any of the characters the plot was all too predictable to the point that i followed it and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a in the middle ages a social outcast to that time might be disappointed
<START> mel brooks has really outdone himself on this movie no one can deny that blazing saddles was a classic and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film but men in tights has become the apex of his creative genius this movie is a definite must see if you enjoy this movie i would also recommend space balls and history of the world the same goes in reverse if you have seen any of these movies then men in tights should be next on your list
<START> well i don't normally think there's such a thing as a horrible movie but this is pretty damned close the best acting performance in the whole thing was snoop dogg who has one line in a 10 second scene i agree with the glad it was short review the music videos at the end were cool though
<START> before this clip music videos were merely to display an artist michael jackson's thriller created a whole new section of music videos which can honestly be called mini movies thriller follows a couple as they travel to the girl's house from a movie on the way they encounter zombies announced by the immortal vincent price my favorite part is where the zombies stagger in on the couple and the girl turns to see that michael has turned into one of them then they do a little dance the scariest thing about thriller may be the fact that it is consistently more fun and enjoyable than a lot of movies that are made after twenty years it remains the premier music video br br p s my music video top 5 5 madonna like a prayer 4 guns n' roses sweet child of mine 3 nine inch nails closer 2 peter gabriel sledgehammer 1 michael jackson thriller
<START> this was very good except for two things which i'll mention at the end the animation is great highlighted by nick park and company's trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters which make you laugh almost every time you see someone the color was magnificent too br br the best part of the film however is the clever comedy woven throughout this is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags it's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball wallace and his silent and smart dog gromit along the way it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in best of show br br my only complaints were two typical traits of today's films animated or not 1 let's make the cleric in the film look like a total idiot 2 let's overdo the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone those aside this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times
<START> some time ago we read of the results of a poll taken by some newspaper sports writers the questions posed were only two and were brief and right to the point br br the question number 1 asked to tell who was his most beloved college football team question number 2 asked the fan to name his most hated college football team the answer to both questions was simply notre dame nd is tops on both lists yeah love 'em or hate 'em but you sure don't ignore em br br the roots of this unique position of this college football powerhouse are found in the life and career of one grown up little immigrant boy from chicago named br br as a biopic the production of all american 1940 came out relatively close to the death of coach in a 1930 plane crash it was about 10 years after that the film was released that would mean that preliminary work on the project started about 8 years after our nation's great loss of mr br br his likeness and voice were well known from newspapers radio and motion picture news reels both widow bonnie and the university of notre dame had approval rights in choosing the actor to play the lead and the script we think that they could not have done the job any better pat o'brien truly looks the part and was himself a footballer in college ronald reagan is cast in the pivotal role of george a free spirited student going to notre dame on a baseball scholarship he was a walk on football player br br the cast runs full of talented players we have griffith veteran donald crisp as fr callaghan c s c notre dame president albert is fr the chemistry prof and mentor gail page appears as the mrs bonnie owen davis jr is cohort gus the passer in that historic nd vs army game at west point br br the cast is rounded out by kane richmond nick william marshall and william byrne as the four horsemen real life big time college coaches howard jones warner bill and amos alonzo appear as themselves in scenes of congressional probe into college sports and add an authentic touch br br as for biopic all american all one can only say that it hits the ground running and did not slow down from beginning to end there is no wasted time either all the screen time is used to move the story along br br use of notre dame choir the campus itself and all that brass band march music all ad to the feeling of really being there br br to this day even though their basketball team and other sports teams compete in the big east conference notre dame remains an independent in ncaa football what this means that in effect the fighting irish play a national schedule br br there was no such agreement with the family of george there was a lawsuit some years ago over the scene portraying young mr giving the famous win for the speech television prints of this all were minus the speech in the death bed scene br br other notre dame themed films were made over the years the spirit of notre dame universal 1931 featured j farrell mcdonald as a look alike coach it also featured lew ayers andy devine nat pendleton as well as the members of the real notre dame championship teams featuring the real four horsemen then of course we have rudy tri star 1993 with sean astin jon favreau ned beatty and charles dutton among others in a fine cast there was also talk of an unauthorized film critical of notre dame called golden glory but nothing has materialized has it let me know dear reader thanx br br warner brothers always had great music in their both in opening themes and in incidental music in this movie they have incorporated the notre dame fight song in the score along with it were step notre dame and the notre dame alma mater which had its premiere at the funeral in 1930 at the notre dame
<START> i cannot believe anyone is giving this film a good rating in addition to the terrible acting thin nonexistent plot line and pace this would be the movie to watch if you were really trying to fall asleep the writer's and director's brains must have been fried eggs to ever have concocted something as abominable as this based on the plot summary on the dvd case the premise really sounded promising but within the first ten minutes i knew it was a lost cause if you want to see a really creep take on the area 51 idea check out the remake of the hills have eyes dreamland will soon fade away as all pathetic films of its ilk do next
<START> i watched this video because i like malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there very disappointing since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island just the hot dry and barren elements the movie was dull boring completely incoherent from beginning to end pretentious and devoid of any conceivable plot you had to be a psychic to follow the plot line or lack thereof it had its moments sure but so does going to the dentist br br in short i'd much rather endure another before viewing this horrible mess again it was so bad i actually couldn't fall asleep there are quite a few eurotrash movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision this is one of them on the bright side who is nadia cassini never before have i seen a more beautiful set of legs she is the one saving grace of this movie br br disturbing too was the cruel boar hunt depicted in the closing credits a boar that was released on someone's property malta has very few native mammals all of them small rats bats etc and then set upon by dogs before it was shot oh well go visit malta anyway despite this film it's a beautiful colorful island rich in history and lots of fun
<START> this is quite an entertaining b flick in the universal horror series featuring dracula the wolfman and frankenstein's monster the plot revolves around dracula john carradine and larry talbot the wolfman lon chaney jr separately visiting a revolutionary doctor they both ask him if they can be cured and the doctor attempts to devise a way for each beneath the doctor's castle they find frankenstein's monster buried in mud this is apparently a reference to the previous movie in the frankenstein series br br of course if things had went as planned the movie would have turned out incredibly boring instead dracula can't suppress his appetite and the doctor is eventually infected by a blood transfusion with vampirism as a semi vampire the doctor goes insane and awakens frankenstein's monster as with all of the universal horror series the ending is completely unsatisfactory a beautiful woman with a hunchback one of the doctor's two assistants has a particularly gruesome end plus you just have to feel sorry for frankenstein's monster in this film he's awake for around two minutes kills one police officer and then yet another building what's this the fifth now collapses on top of him and is consumed by flames it is also unfortunate that the great character created in the wolf man 1941 larry talbot is really reduced here people that film and chaney's performance in it here he would be justifiably criticized as wooden all in all though it's a pretty fun movie at just 68 minutes a nice waste of time 7 10
<START> a beautiful woman a backwoods inbred monster man a super sweet monster truck a road kill zombie brother and 2 friends one anal retentive overly sensitive nerd and the other a foul mouthed adolescent slob throw them all together with a dash of jeepers creepers texas chainsaw massacre and road trip and you've got monster man a hilarious horror comedy outing that never sets out to say something it's a simple straight forward laugh fest unpretentious and well made this horror comedy is at its heart a buddy flick this film offered some hilarious and sickening set pieces i highly recommend this to fright fans looking to be entertained
<START> good job that's how i would describe this animated scooby doo adventure this is so far the best of the animated scooby movies i have seen i liked the story i thought it had some depth to to it the movie is also well paced it doesn't get boring for a minute it also has an interesting group of characters besides scooby and shaggy and the gang of course plus the movie was a real blast i has a lot of fun watching it i also liked the great scottish music it was very catchy and infectious naturally we know that scooby and the will solve the mystery but it's still fun getting to that point the animation is also pretty good for this movie i would love it if they did a 3d animation scooby adventure but we'll just have to wait and see for me scooby doo and the loch ness monster is a 7 10
<START> this third installment in the scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot i know i know but how good is it well let's not be silly it's still pretty bad but by comparison to the first two it's a fine film again shot on digital with decent lighting and good camera work br br spoiler br br when a college baseball team new members one is left in a diabetic coma of course they abandon him in a cornfield tied to a scarecrow in keeping with the legend the boy's soul is transferred into the body of the scarecrow which comes to life and wreaks terrible vengeance on well pretty much everyone the co eds drive to the beach which is somehow very close to the cornfield on the sunny beach they are killed one by one by the whistling scarecrow br br writer director brian does a credible job of bringing some much needed drama to the film unfortunately the drama leaps over good and lands in common cheese much of the acting was fair but there were some really terrible bits including an awful piece of poorly done lip synching some plot points were left mostly unresolved and most were used to get someone alone so they could be slaughtered again better than the previous installments but still lacking
<START> this production of hamlet prince of denmark is by far the best that i have seen although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations it does have the most important element sir derek jacobi as hamlet br br jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed prince is multi layered and riveting his displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow love to and everywhere else on the map but without seeming forced or over the top in fact some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them with stillness soft speech and thoughtful expression as to whether or not he interprets hamlet as mad or sane well you should decide for yourselves i changed my mind more than once at one point it seems he has thought himself sane and merely playing at madness but suspects that he is actually mad after all a revelation to himself captured beautifully having performed the part of hamlet on stage more times than any other actor in history jacobi's affinity for the role then comes as little surprise br br as for the production itself it is presented as a kind of filmed copy of the stage play with little special effects or fancy camera work minimal sets and no musical accompaniment to speak of this production relies on the acting prowess of the cast and the words of shakespeare to evoke the emotion and interest of its audience and it works the other players are top notch as well particularly patrick stewart's claudius and claire bloom's gertrude together the cast present a seamless ensemble br br the last but far from least element that makes this production stand out is the play itself here it is presented in its entirety a rarity on film but oddly enough i never noticed the time i was too busy getting caught up in the story i suspect that you will too
<START> this tearful movie about a sister and her battle to save as many souls as she can is very moving the film does well in picking up the characters and showing how sister helen deals with each br br a wonderful journey from life to death br br
