<START> send them to the freezer this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile if you can stand it definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive
<START> i really loved the millenium series starred by lance henriksen which is why i bought the film obviously at some level it was a mistake mutant monster films are usually very bad and this film is no exception br br the basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail well nevertheless this film would never have been a success even with a good director actors but the way it turns out this is just a b class movie the scenes that are supposed to be scary seem more funny to me and the critter is not credible at all br br however watching this film with group of friends in restless mood makes this film shine as it is so unintentionally hilarious
<START> i do not see what is the whole deal about this movie patricia sings yes and that makes the film charming but singing is not enough i mean if you want to get all benefits of this one go buy patricia's cd and enjoy the plot is simple if to omit the dreams the main characters seem to love each other instantly and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances relationships appear almost mandatory and the little detective story thrown in just makes things worse what at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream i measure movies by how well i would remember them and for this one i already started to forget the details
<START> insane really even if you haven't seen the original george cukor movie with norma shearer joan crawford rosalind russell goddard joan fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars you may dismiss this forced politically correct depressing comedy depressing for many different reasons meg ryan for one what has she done to herself her face can hardly move that alone puts her miles away from norma shearer annette bening should be suing the dp and debra messing what the hell was she doing here actresses with no connection in the public's subconscious trying to pass for friends totally unconvincingly eva mendes in the joan crawford part is an outrageous piece of miscasting what a terrible idea her character is like a trans gender performer without any taste or subtlety bizarre to think that a woman adapted and directed this women the only positive things i can mention are a short but very funny appearance by bette midler and cloris leachman as the housekeeper
<START> this was a really interesting halloween film i wasnt to thrilled with the whole thorn theory but it still makes for a good film i liked getting to see tommy doyle back but sadly donald pleasance died right after shooting the film had a really really bad director who didnt give a flip about the series from what i heard treated donald bad and wouldnt let danielle harris come back as jamie its like he was just trying to bring down the film but i still liked it there were alot of cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the producers cut which features over 40 min of never before scenes with those scenes it turns into a whole new movie check it out if you have the chance
<START> first they came for the communists and i didn't speak up because i wasn't a communist then they came for the jews and i didn't speak up because i wasn't a jew then they came for the catholics and i didn't speak up because i was a protestant then they came for me and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me br br attributed to rev martin 1945 br br when faced with intolerance or injustice the easiest thing to do is nothing speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn but when does enough become too much global anti semitic sentiments allowed hitler's genocidal policies to thrive and equal doses of fear mongering and ignorance made it possible for the anti communist of mccarthyism to destroy thousands of peoples' lives inaction makes one no less culpable br br lawrence newman is a chameleon of a man quiet and nondescript he blends seamlessly with his surroundings lawrence doesn't like to get involved when he witnesses an attack on a young woman he tells no one and goes about his business his world spirals into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and is mistaken for one of them lawrence's view of the world and its view of him is forever altered br br while the subject matter of this film is not new its presentation is definitely unique it is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when placed within a certain context lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is jewish than he is with the views of his attackers he believes that if he corrects this oversight that everything will be all right not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand br br whether playing a schemer the only thing i liked about fargo or a down home nice guy sheriff william h macy's roles are linked by a common thread his characters share a subtle deliberate countenance that gives them substance macy nails lawrence down to the smallest detail and says more with a furtive glance or tremble in his voice than a page of dialogue by showing rather than telling lawrence is able to share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer the supporting cast brings the story together br br laura dern is compelling as lawrence's bombshell wife with a past trailer park rough yet other worldly wise she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of a mistake and unwittingly lawrence's situation michael lee aka meatloaf is frightening as fred the prototypical redneck next door equal parts ignorance and venom rallying neighbours to his virulent cause in the midst of the chaos is david paymer the focus of the aggression and the voice of reason that raises the important questions even handed portrayal keeps from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to engender sympathy making his one of the strongest performances in the film br br the tight editing and close cropped cinematography make for a clean picture with few distractions and mixes an air of claustrophobia in with the small town usa feel it is simultaneously comforting and disturbing the deliberate use of harsh two tone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully scored soundtrack are powerful without being overwhelming finally the set and costume designs recreate the feel of the era an essential component in the film's message br br focus' unconventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses
<START> this film is one of those that can't be regarded by its indeed at a first sight it seems that the story simply focus the desire of have more money but let's take a look on the other side what do you see you see that the money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings the human being have should i do the right thing or should't i and what's the right thing make a deeper analyses what does it mean a little town in the border it means that sometimes we can go too close to the border of doing something we thought we couldn't what does it mean the arid soil shown in this picture it means the that sometimes take possession our hearts what does it mean the phrase of the character kristen now i belong to him it means the loss of our free will due to our unpremeditated deeds in my opinion that's the writer of the story and the director tried to tell us by the way do you remember what another character jack barnes said nothing is so simple
<START> this movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship not one review described this movie as a gay romance film and that's the weight of the plot i don't know if this was to trick people that would otherwise be uninterested to sit through it expecting the film to be as it was marketed the film is out of touch with graffiti culture abuses and defames graffiti culture and the acting is abysmal oh yeah the graffiti sucks too this movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys getting gay just look at the rest of the movies the director's been involved with all contain the same subject matter boring as hell not what i expected
<START> this movie has got to be the biggest disappointment i've ever experienced with a film the acting is horrific the suspense build up minimal and the plot overall is ridiculous i found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we're asked to make in logic and the so called suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried i'm dismayed that a sequel is planned because it means they'll be asking us to once again swallow a sub par plot line if this is an example of raw work i think i'll be avoiding any and all future films by them
<START> this review contains spoilers br br i was searching through horror movie dvds on amazon when i came across flight of the living dead i already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a rip off of snakes on a plane but it was selling brand new for so i figured i didn't really have much to lose br br the music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all although i did like the song itself a pop rock song isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie it started off surprisingly well the opening scenes weren't too bad some of the acting was a little cringe worthy but not as bad as i initially thought it would be br br it all goes well until laura rocket from kill bill vol 2 enters the picture she is supposed to be playing a scientist if she is she's not a very bright one luckily she's polished off pretty quickly br br i actually physically laughed out loud when the camera panned over the passengers of the plane during some turbulence there was a nun have you ever been on a plane with a nun i was surprised she wasn't clutching a crucifix br br finally after 35 minutes we get to some zombie action and use the word 'action' loosely the special effects are pretty below standard but that's to be expected from a movie with this budget being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie though it makes you look pretty amusing using slow motion doesn't work particularly well either i think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story trying to pass off the problem as a variant of the malaria virus wasn't an especially good move either considering malaria isn't a virus br br the rest of the movie pretty much plays out like any other zombie movie most of the characters are killed off and it eventually ends up with a handful of people fighting to stay alive possibly the worst part of flight of the living dead is the utterly inconceivable ending i know it's a movie about people who come back to life and feast on the living but the ending was just ridiculous rating
<START> when you make a film with a killer kids premise there are two effective ways to approach it you can either make it as realistic as possible creating believable characters and situations or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs something which the makers of silent night deadly night did for example on an equally controversial subject a killer santa the people who made bloody birthday however do neither of those things they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun or a knife or a noose or an arrow in his her hand the result is both offensive and stupid the whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production and then kept from release for several years it's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids but it's very sloppily made 1 2
<START> i've just watched and i'm stunned to see the 8 10 average rating for the show br br not only was the plot was difficult to follow but it seems character development was randomly applied br br the actors were adequate but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tedious br br and just in case anyone didn't see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film br br the end scene is disappointing and phoned in and anyone who sat back and went ohhh so they were carpet munchers all along must have been out for the evening br br two stars for the hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it
<START> i have just written a comment to aces high 1976 and that remind me of this film which i watched as kid when it was released since then i have watched it only once and that was more than enough as kevin well says it is a complete waste of time apart from the dog fights which are nicely done the rest is a sequence of badly patched scenes with actors struggling with a lousy script and equally lousy direction i do not remember the silly german accents mentioned by kevin in his comment but that is another pathetic mistake if corman tried to make more convincing the characterization of the german pilots why didn't he use german actors or have those parts dubbed on the other hand is good example of the appalling hollywood style of film making with their villains so clearly identifiable not only by their cruel actions but also by their grotesque accents br br talking about cruel actions the ridiculous scene were lieutenant hermann goering murders english nurses during an attack on an is an absolutely disgusting piece of propaganda done with historical hindsight if you want to a see a factual moving very well acted and directed film about the air war during wwi watch aces high 1976 or that wonderful classic the dawn patrol 1938 you shall not be disappointed
<START> this really is an okay series everyone in it is pretty good but i just can't take reba she's trying to be funny but she just isn't and then she got a stupid accent if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day br br i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before reba is destroying the show however the 20 year old guy dont know his name but he's soooo funny and he's really saving it all br br so here's the recipe to get a great show kick reba of it and then put the 20 year old guy into the lead role br br i really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks like me that they should kick reba of the show and put someone else in the lead role
<START> after a man turns up dead a soldier becomes the prime suspect undoubtedly the best film to feature three roberts and all of them are in fine form young is the cool headed pipe smoking cop investigating the murder mitchum is the murder concerned friend and ryan is a hot headed soldier with something to hide grahame has a brief but effective role as a femme fatale future tarzan barker has a bit part as a soldier this film touches on anti semitism a subject also covered in best picture oscar winner gentleman's agreement which was released the same year it is solidly directed by who creates an effective film noir atmosphere
