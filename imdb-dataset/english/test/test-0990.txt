<START> on the positive i'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen long whiny and pointless and i'm not saying this to be mean i really wanted to like this film it seemed to have everything going for it had the so called buzz and was a hassle to track down besides had a little more effort gone into it on the story side i believe this would've been amazing and i expect the team behind it will produce wonderful work in the future they clearly have the ability but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go
<START> this is a great movie a must own i really liked every aspect of it from the sword fighting the romance the costumes were really well done and put together the scenery is absolutely beautiful i also loved the mystery and magic also the message of the power of love that love is the greatest power there is i really like the heart of the king in the sense that he desires peace instead of the bloodshed and hate i wish that i could live in a world like that with flying ships to castles in the sky i also think that it was really nice how they brought the animals into the movie i also thought that the cook was really funny i have watched it many times in one day and still never tire of it just wish they would bring it onto a dvd
<START> the plot here is simple country boy farrell goes to the city to sell the wheat crop falls in love with a waitress kate duncan and marries her bringing her home to a hostile father and a group of woman hungry reapers there are shades of they knew what they wanted and mice and men here the courtship taking place in two lengthy sequences set in the restaurant consume the first half hour and are lethargically paced is so weak he allows his father to mistreat his wife who is propositioned by mac richard alexander one of the reapers to come away with him duncan and alexander are the only good things in this tedious potboiler which lacks the insights and the cinematic beauty we expect from murnau farrell's character has no backbone so we wind up rooting for a real man mac to take kate away from it all with audience sympathy skewed the film loses its narrative progression the father's conversion at film's end is unrealistic and unbelievable making for a contrived denouement this film is for fans of the stars and the director only general audiences need not bother
<START> interesting concept that just doesn't make it i watched the whole movie but had to read imdb comments to find out what code 46 meant if when it was explained in the film i must have been in a coma or possibly brain dead by then i only watched it for tim robbins the fact that i did not know any of the other actors should have been a tip off we all have to start somewhere but this film should not be it as to the 'anti empathy virus holy utility belt batman where were the joker the riddler etc also why are the women all so damned ugly if i want to see less than plain stick figures i'll just walk down the street the best part of the film was the car crash it was totally believable and not over the top like most movie crashes
<START> this is an odd movie on the surface it's no different to many other d grade gore movies but in at least a few ways it stands out firstly the main killer character is really weird how the heck a guy who only ever like a chicken got paroled is totally beyond me what was that female parole board member thinking he's totally reformed and rehabilitated he another problem with luther the geek is the script direction for the women the daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she was mine slap her in attempting to untie her mother off the bed she struggles with knots and just doesn't seem to think i'll get scissors or a knife later on in a similar attempt to untie her mother she wanders down stairs and starts searching in a box of scrap booking stuff for some scissors eventually she gets a knife by the way this is after the killer has obviously left in the car and just returned bizarre on the plus side the daughter did get her kit off for the shower scene so that was nice although again unusual it seems that in many of these d grade gore movies they happily show throats being bitten open with gushing blood but the sight of a female breast is somehow too strong for the audience in general it worked but it was annoying and nasty although the bare breasts made up for some of that
<START> ok first to all the haters get a life i don't see why you even bother to post on these boards when obviously you know nothing about cinema robots or people br br this movie has an important lessons for all of us to learn about gender stereotypes relationships and destiny really we are all robots programmed to respond certain ways to certain stimuli without thinking how many times have we seen a sunset and made some trite comment without even thinking about it i say thank you aqua brilliantly played by bernadette peters for making me stop and think about the awesome power of mother nature br br it's only when val and aqua begin to reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire to find love and to flee the factory in search of a creative life this movie should be mandatory viewing in prisons just think of the dreams and hopes it could inspire in the inmates maybe even they could overcome their bad programming and join the rest of us in a crime free world br br we can all learn a lot from these robots i am a better person for
<START> another good animation from disney sequels are not always that great and tend to follow the same plot as the original however the son of tramp tries to savor the world out side the home and family he knows and learns where he actually belongs being a junkyard dog is not for everyone er dog that is but scamp overcomes adversity the voices of the various characters were superb and provided by several well know actors such as scott wolf alyssa milano and mickey rooney entertaining and a well made family movie
<START> it's difficult to express how bad this movie is even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts clean clothes haircuts etc was a common reaction to the smug middle class mores of both the usa and western europe this movie would have been a stinker the plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina if that's the correct latin grammar the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics by the male lead as well as the females the gratuitous view of catherine deneuve's or somebody's breasts are worthy of a budweiser commercial the repeated orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie i'm ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot but underneath his clothes this king has no substance
<START> from time to time it's very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the world br br and that's what happens in the love light the first film directed by dame france marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter better for her certainly because her career as a film director doesn't impress this german count br br the film tells the story of dame angela dame mary pickford a merry italian girl who lives surrounded by a picturesque squalor an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by picturesque luxury Â she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and dame angela's two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead but destiny is even and dame angela meanwhile falls in love withÂ a german and to make things worse she doesn't know that her teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal don't mean ich liebe but sink any damn italian boat at sea Â br br fortunately for dame angela pretty soon her sweetie german spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him a not strange fact indeed because it is not an easy task for a german to go but the german spy will prefer to die before being captured by those italians br br from that german love a half teutonic baby will born the wicked destiny at full but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a catholic nun who has taken the council of trent to a fact that will put dame angela at the verge of insanity br br but meanwhile dame angela's secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally dame angela's sorrowful life will improve a tremendous mistake because destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind but as they say in germany it may be a blessing in disguise and finally dame angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people br br as this german count said before it was much better for dame frances marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter because as can be seen in the love light she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories ja wohl Â but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of dame pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances br br and now if you'll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must send morse signals from the schloss north tower to one of his teutonic rich heiress
<START> lady and the tramp ii adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movies compared to the is better lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original but this time it's junior's turn lady and youngster scamp always hates been treated with the things that has to be done with him following the rules in the house taking baths all the time and taking things nice and easy scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left off the loose scamp meets another dog called angel they both get along fine and do the things mother and father did having an italian meal and meatballs etc afterwards scamp realises that he is loved by his family especial his pal which is the baby scamp comes back and angel is joined in the family i give this movie 10 out of 10
<START> i consider myself lucky that i got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors kramer vs kramer was great to me because i think i could relate to it br br unfortunately my parents are divorced even though i was older than billy in this movie i felt his pain and confusion having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst through this movie actually i think it made me realize that my parents are people too and they had as just much pain as my sister and i had br br back to the movie this was a good one yes it's dated and meryl and dustin are very young but i would recommend this for a lot of people because i think most can relate in some way there are funny sad happy and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors it's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7 5 br br 9 10
<START> perhaps spoiler well i ve seen it at the film festival in cologne and i have to say it s ridiculous sorry author and writer and whatever but it is the worst try making a good movie i ve ever seen if u ve got 5000 times the possibility to get away from your enemy and u don't do it its getting boring there are in the movie witch gives u the impression that they are forgotten e g a in front of a security cam they are asking for help and a somebody sees it and the police than there is a cut and nothing the killer gets a shot in his head and 50 secs later he is behaving like nothing happened no its no zombie movie and finally the final the big end which we were promised hmmmm lets say take a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best endings in history so badly that everything goes wrong im not going to vote 1 because the actress is beautiful
<START> i only went to see this movie because i have always liked kevin costner i felt that ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect unfortunately even though these two actors were are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here some of the scenes were just not believable and didn't have enough story line support br br though the movie claims influence from the hurricane katrina aftermath there was very little none to that effect in the movie br br overall i liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective br br the special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating not sure i'll ever go deep sea fishing again br br i expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented br br definitely a movie that could've been seen on dvd
<START> the year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four pictures tackling real events real people with varying degrees of critical praise of the four pictures to make it to the race to the oscars in early 2005 kinsey the aviator hotel rwanda and ray ray became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to jamie foxx for his portrayal of r b genius ray charles br br and it was well deserved despite that leonardo dicaprio came close and liam neeson wasn't even nominated what made foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics ray charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that charles' had penned it did help that jamie foxx rose well above the movie itself as a whole somewhat weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a tv biopic and his portrayal is detailed as it's ferocious he has the delicate assignment which is to embody a person down to nuances and once the crisis of ray's addiction to heroin hits a head foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real ray actually going through such a painful ordeal br br the low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing ray's relationship with women like the aviator taylor wishes to establish that ray had this turbulent life a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of baggage of the women the only one to succeed bringing real life is warren as ray's mother hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young ray but her facial and body language is gut wrenching especially at the moment she must relinquish her maternity to have ray find his way around the house such intensity of emotion to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence a beautiful performance and one which should have been acknowledged br br a fantastic counterpoint to ray is the featured music anyone who knows r b will enjoy the early recordings of ray's radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the forefront of popular music and jamie foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as ray that alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic i would have though loved it if they would have used his last adult contemporary hit from 1993 sing my song for you in the closing credits after all it is ray charles a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art
<START> lance used to get quality support work from james cameron heck he even had his own tv show millenium for a seasons why is he doing this couldn't he find some better way to pay his bills br br i love a good low budget movie some of them you can laugh at simply due to their ludicrous premise their textbook stereotyped characters or often times because the actors are related to the director producers but this movie has no redeeming value i didn't laugh i didn't cry i only had this sick feeling in my stomach that feeling was quickly identified as pity at one point lance henriksen was an a list support actor he's been in terminator he was going to be terminator before arnold showed up aliens classic b movie pumpkinhead among so many others i wanted to send him money after this maybe we should start a support lance fund or something br br then again for making this thing maybe not
