<START> while the remake of the excellent day of the has better esthetics and a boatload budget this film nails the actual persona of carlos down br br quinn excels as the naval officer enlisted to impersonate the wiley to draw him out of hiding and at the hands of kingsley and sutherland turns himself inside out to do so risking his family his career and all that he believes in he takes on the task albeit utterly unwillingly br br to say more would spoil it this is an excellent film br br 3 1 2 niro stars of 4
<START> this movie started off well enough sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch the soundtrack was bad saxaphone and electric guitars it was gratingly incongruous the female singer was positively dreary in the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn too dark for austen northanger abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to catherine's eyes br br who in the heck is this with the ghastly makeup and wig a totally extraneous and unnecessary character br br one of the key elements in the book is the general is not a gothic monster like the characters in catherine's books his monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his children's spirits and his treatment of catherine based on money concerns alone he does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send miss morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home only her friend miss thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded this whole point gets seriously muddled in the film they make the general too dark from the outset br br peter firth should have not sung this part was painful to watch his depiction of wasn't too bad but it was a shade dark in places henry of the book made sport of miss imagination on trip to northanger but he was never dark firth would have benefited from better direction the young lady who played isabella needed a better acting coach john was appropriately odious the striped and coattails combo he wore was ghastly it certainly fit his character br br i think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack it cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie if i watch it again it will be with the sound off and subtitles on perhaps i would give the film a 4 then br br the sound quality of the dvd was quite poor the picture quality was not much better this is glaringly noticeable on a digital television br br when i think of what this film could have been i think of persuasion with amanda root and ciaran hinds
<START> imaginary heroes is clearly the best film of the year it was a complete and utter joy to watch i was riveted the whole audience up at the sunset five was riveted when the film ended no one moved spoke nothing i think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of drama work of this younger generation br br there were moments in your film many like at least seven where i was struck by such a great amount of beauty emotional beauty that i actually couldn't breathe for a while and for a catharsis junkie like me that's about the best experience i could ask for it is the result of powerful masterful storytelling and direction like heavyweight stuff like and those guys br br each element of the film fit tightly together there were no missteps at all the cast was amazing i have been a huge fan of and ryan's for a long time and i thought they have never been better i was am will be continuously stunned by this film and i promise i will drag every person i know to see it it should be seen it should win awards
<START> this is by far the worst british comedy ever how it made it past the first episode let alone the pilot is beyond me the acting is weak from the main character played by ben miller to sarah alexander from the fantastic coupling right through the cast the plot story lines were unfunny and very very predictable using many worn out ideas a very painful series to endure but sadly put in a slot between two excellent shows describing it as britain's answer to ' meet the parents' does a disservice to 'meet the parents' and is as about as fresh as an old shoe that has a run around with the family dog britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at america's sad attempts at doing so
<START> i think i've finally seen the worst movie ever made and it hurts me to say that as a big fan of indie cinema gay or otherwise i had high hopes several minutes into the film however the sheriff appeared and has my vote for the worst actor of this or any other century his performance and the dialog he was forced to perform caused me the unusual step of stopping the dvd in its track hours later when i screwed up enough courage to press the play button again it was no better br br aside from the sheriff and his cartoon racist deputies the film has an attractive cast for whom i felt genuine sympathy since they had such a miserable script the idea behind the film is fine using lynching of gay men in the new south the same way it was used on black men in the old south leaving strange fruit hanging from the trees br br with an accomplished writer and director we might have had a movie instead we get fake detective work platitudes about homosexuality and a clichÃ© with a the one good white man trying to save the day br br i have no doubt that racism still flourishes the fbi is currently investigating a white school bus driver in the back woods of who forced the black kids to get to the back of the bus but this town is a cartoon and it is hard to believe anything you see or hear br br there a few subplots in a weak attempt to try to make the main character more three dimensional but for the most part they also fail miserably br br for the truly masochistic the dvd contains some deleted scenes that will leave you running for cover br br the is probably the first movie that makes me believe that writer directors should have to pass a test and get licensed before they can make a film although i would look forward to seeing several of the cast members in better films i would be hard pressed to witness anything else from this director
<START> i like steve buscemi i like his work very much both as an actor and a director you could say that i am into steve buscemi a steve buscemi freak i steve buscemi br br i remember when i first saw buscemi's full length directorial debut trees lounge i enjoyed the movie although it wasn't as good as it could have been it was almost there it almost scratched that itch the itch of wanting to see small movies about small people in small bars that are in small towns it was close enough to where i would say that it was a very good movie one that with a few tweaks could have been great but that's ok i like the movie and i've watched it more than once br br but this review is not about trees lounge it's about lonesome jim when i saw the description of the movie and then i saw who's movie it was i was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that i knew that trees lounge could have been but what i actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an of cheap floozy heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol induced impotence and regurgitation br br in other words this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that i wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning or if you happen to be the floozy waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile the film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich with store brand white bread no less and the emotion of a cadaver i am not sure what the point of this film was and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission sorta like those new cars that don't come with anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars i'm not one of them but hey i can sympathize overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film i mean trees lounge was about boring people doing boring things but it was interesting br br i blame a lot of this on affleck why do people keep casting these affleck turds they suck the life out of anything that they are connected with one affleck was in one decent film and wasn't even the reason why the film was decent and all of the sudden every named affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can and liv tyler is no better being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress she is as lifeless as affleck these people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script people pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma these two duds together don't have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at wal mart i always thought that steve buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of but oh steve you let us down this film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper
<START> a year after the release of the average house of frankenstein universal released another monster mash where all their famous character would collide once again house of dracula would reunite dracula the frankenstein's creature and the wolf man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for the studio directed once again by c house of dracula presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed although still flawed story that while far from perfect is a more appropriate closure than the previous film br br the story ignores most of the events of the previous entry house of frankenstein and introduces a new angle to the story count dracula john carradine tired of having to hide during sunlight asks help to the brilliant scientist dr edelman onslow stevens a physician famous for his research in biology edelman becomes fascinated by dracula and soon begins an experimental treatment in the mean time larry talbot lon chaney jr the wolf man visits edelman with the purpose of get rid of his curse soon edelman realizes that dracula is a monster that must be destroyed but his own exposure to dracula's blood is also developing a disease in him the discovery of the frankenstein's monster glenn strange in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist br br after the previous clash of monsters it is good to see the series going back to the roots and delivering an almost straight forward gothic horror returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries the story by edward t lowe jr has many interesting themes as the contrast between dracula and talbot both looking for a cure but with different purposes and edelman's increasing madness probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of nina a gorgeous but deformed woman who aids dr edelman hoping to be cured of her condition br br director c is back again and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film despite the low budget crafts a gothic horror that while simple is quite effective and even manages to present old partners such a these characters in a fresh way while it's never on the level of the originals house of dracula recovers that charm that universal studios horror films used to have and makes sure that at least for a last time the monsters receive a chance to shine br br the cast is very good this time with carradine chaney and strange reprising their roles although role is considerably smaller with more enthusiasm than in the previous film the addition of onslow stevens jane adams and martha to the cast bring back the tragedy and the drama to the series with stevens giving a terrific performance as dr edelman a small cameo by lionel atwill and the presence of skelton as the creepy complete one of the better cast universal horror films has had in years br br house of dracula is a nice addition to the series specially after the mediocre house of frankenstein it's nice to see back in form in a somewhat serious horror film however and while the plot is quite original it suffers not only because of the budget but because the film attempts to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results it's true that the characters have all very inventive story lines but the film dedicates very few time for each of them to develop and the film seems very rushed and disjointed br br while far from perfect it's also far from being the worst of the series house of dracula is a nice closure to one of the best times for the horror genre a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the foggy nights and mad scientists gave life to hideous monsters later the monsters would be back in bud abbott lou costello meet frankenstein 1948 but that would be a whole different context after the disappointing previous entries it's easy to dismiss house of dracula but give it a chance and let the monster roam for a last time 7 10
<START> i thought this is an unbelievable boring movie i heard the director can't speak french and so he left his actors tell what they wanted well valeria is great as usual but i can't say the same of other actors they have nothing to say especially bruno br br they all seem very tired this being one of the movie plot tired of being together of living abroad of their live in general so they spend half the movie sleeping in a hotel room after a while i felt sleepy myself br br i gave 4 because of some very beautiful scenes including the last one
<START> more maybe is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by pink floyd in 1969 they weren't superstars yet actually they made an album with the film music no fan can miss it br br but this is also the first film of german french director barbet schroeder it's a cult movie when it was released censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs it is also one of the first films to treat explicitly the theme of drug slavery br br a german boy travels to paris and meets an american girl they fall in love together they search for sun and exoticism but it's a too high price love she initiates him into drugs br br in the sixties anti drug campaigns were not like today there wasn't much information on the contrary in many taking drugs was a sort of spiritual experience so it's quite surprising to see a film of that period which describes a nightmarish heroin experience br br the film is simple not vulgar at all and shot in a cinema veritÃ© style actors farmer and klaus are very convincing more is a document of the end of the sixties and a document of the end of the hippies illusions as well
<START> there is more to this movie than meets the eye if you're looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy you'll be disappointed but for an entertaining 90 minutes this is just fine br br the cinematography is careful and precise the sex scenes which one comment as gratuitous are anything but every gesture contributes to the development of the characters br br yes some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings but the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light without being sensationalistic at least not for early 21st century urban standards and there are many very amusing moments
<START> this movie is like porn with all of the good parts removed it's like all of the porn stars that didn't want to fulfill their obligations banded together around this awful trite useless piece of gargoyle abstinence br br this is a helpful movie if you're in the mood to torture a loved or no longer loved one it's important that if you choose to use this movie as a method of torture that you put in earplugs and put on a blindfold to keep yourself from going insane br br if i had a choice between this movie and the 700 club i'd choose girls gone wild br br overall better if you've been drinking but only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions
<START> ahhh the '80's 1982 makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in america fresh off the do what feels good '70's the last american virgin comes as a wolf in sheep's clothing as yet another sex comedy' from the glory days oh sure there's sex but i can't think of another movie ok this and fast times at ridgemont high that really wasn't killing time between topless teenage scenes there was some pretty good stuff here amongst the cleavage br br the movie follows three hormonal friends gary wanting to lose his virginity rick stud incarnate and david overweight but not inexperienced as they try desperately hard to make sure gary joins the world of manhood but a funny thing happens on the way to the gary falls for karen pretty brunette who loves the bad boys and can't seem to follow through with any sexual conquest that david and rick can facilitate only trouble is rick and karen get hot and heavy and karen skips a period it's gary who is by her side as she goes to get her abortion and it's gary who truly cares but who is karen dancing with by film end rick subtract the r and add a d where necessary br br what separates this film from others from the '80's we think about is that by god they attempt some real drama here and not of the my parents just pulled in the driveway variety and you know what i bought it br br it wasn't sloppy it wasn't far fetched and when gary sees rick dancing with karen at the house party at the end of the film i actually felt sorry for the guy our teenage romeo actually believed in unrequited love and when his heart was broken at the end it all sort of touched me br br so all the t a aside there's an actually pretty believable and engaging story here oscar worthy not by a mile but i don't know that i'd lump it into the let's get laid category either like fast times at ridgemont high they actually were trying to do a true film here letting the hi jinx in between fall where it may
<START> this film is dreadful it has absolutely zero laughs hebrew hammer adam goldberg sets out to save from evil santa andy dick perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise while there are some far and few nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent it is laboured hackneyed and ultimately mindlessly boring this despite the fact that goldberg dick and greer hammer's client love interest all have quite considerable screen presence despite being played for what might be described as whacky over the top gags this film is consistently middle class middle of the road muck do not waste 85 minutes of your life on this note the music was good
<START> i wanted to like this film and certainly there is room for a psychological character driven movie which doesn't go for the cheap thrills yet for the enjoyment of a movie one requires a believable plot some pacing and editing and a feeling of involvement in the clearing what starts out as an intriguing mystery with a kidnapping and unknown motives turns into a slow draggy pointless exercise nothing much really happens and the so called character driven angles as expressed by the director in his commentary really don't add up to much br br fine actors are wasted here robert redford does his best trying to engage and outwit willem dafoe dafoe brings a bit of nuance to his character insofar as one can feel somewhat sympathetic towards him it's unfortunate that dafoe has been typecast as a villain he's gone into the christopher walken hall of fame of typecasting br br wendy crewson is usually good but her character's entry into the movie was brief and contrived and i was wondering why they even bothered to introduce her character by far the biggest waste of talent was helen mirren in the director's commentary all i heard was how fabulous a talent she is i agree she's a great actress then why was she not used properly only towards the climax of this movie does she get to show herself but by then the viewer has quit caring br br too bad i liked parts of this movie but as another reviewer wrote once you're halfway in you know the film is not going to get much better
<START> this film was released soon after the conan films a sort of female conan red sonja played by sylvester ex wife brigitte nielsen she's not a very good actress unfortunately as proved in rocky iv and cobra the whole film feels cheap but strangely arnold appears in this film but not as conan although he looks acts and fights like conan from the two conan films i don't know what thats about anyway he only appears about every twenty minutes and doesn't hang around for long maybe arnold filmed this in his time off from filming conan the destroyer or something anyway the film is way to slow and boring for an action film skip this and watch conan the barbarian instead
