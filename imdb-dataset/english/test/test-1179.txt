<START> other commenters have described this movie as classic 1950s scifi with clever use of stock footage and documentary footage and clever character interaction br br nothing could be further from the truth br br yes this is classic 1950s scifi but 1950s scifi at its most blindingly stupid worst br br consider that the first prey is a radar station shown first from the air then on the ground but the station is from the air pictured as on a with snow on one side and semi cleared dark ground on the other side but when on the ground investigators visit the site it's suddenly on a flat evenly white plain miles from the nearest mountain br br consider also the ludicrous pseudo scientific babble of the highly recommended expert who is brought in to examine a huge claw he says well we know one thing it can't have come from an animal because every known species of animal has a bony skeleton even reptiles and birds have bones he then goes on to say that some creatures snails insects do not have bony skeletons me let's define animal here not even in the 1950s could anyone over the age of six take this man as an expert in biology since he clearly doesn't know what an animal is nor have the ability to name several broad categories of animals who lack bony skeletons sharks rays jellyfish insects mollusks arthropods you get the idea the characters are cardboard 2d stock types scientist sidekick girlfriend big bad monster nothing here shows any sense of creativity no pulse no life signs br br there're no witty dialogs the special effects are silly even for their time and the stock footage is employed with a reckless disregard for continuity this is b movie making at its dead worst with a production crew that clearly couldn't be bothered to try even br br use sparingly as sleeping medicine or punishment for small children who're easily offended by bad science
<START> this was is an incredible movie with incredible cast music singing story etc it is a tragedy that some arrogant families the or can keep it from being available to generation after generation i have wanted to see it again all of my life i just found this site and read why it has not been available shame on these families for their pettiness my wife is from germany and she has never seen the movie neither have my step children or my grandchildren it is very sad that a movie of this depth and quality is not available for them to see where do these families get off making such a conceited self important egotistical condescending decision to prohibit generations from enjoying this film these stars these performances this music release the video and let them world judge and enjoy
<START> angels and demons 3 out of 10 clearly something bad has happened to ron howard i don't know what exactly but something has gone very wrong br br howard has always been a decent workman director while he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both cinderella man and apollo 13 were excellent films parenthood was pretty good and even angels and demons prequel sequel the da vinci code was a fun romp in addition none of his films have been downright awful note i have seen neither how the grinch stole christmas nor his newest film heidi montag says no to plastic whats more howard managed to hold this quality is such devise genres as star driven oscar bait a beautiful mind star driven costume drama far and away star driven revenge fantasy ransom and comedies about prostitution and mermaids night shift splash br br angels and demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film scenes are too dark camera angles are all wrong the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus this makes the telling of an already confusing story even more muddled br br dan brown gets picked on a lot but i found the da vinci code a fun readable romp so sue me the movie version of the da vinci code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shooting br br angels and demons however takes place in the claustrophobic confines of vatican city and since howard wasn't allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a lot of running around a cgi back lot the entire film is as if rick did a vatican city special and instead of actually visiting the holy city and pointing his camera rick had to use lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits erased br br while the da vinci code had what i still think is an intriguing central mystery again sue me demons and angels story consists of a plot by the roll eyes now to destroy the vatican their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and raping every student in the ass repeatedly oops my bad apparently the vatican doesn't need any help on that one br br anyway their plan is to infiltrate europe's large kill the head priest and steal three vials of anti matter this begs more than a few questions can the create anti matter can you capture the anti matter once created why is the eu collecting it perhaps they fear a godzilla attack why is the head of anti matter gathering a vatican priest now once they get the anti matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the no just kidding unfortunately the haven't quite grasped that pinky and the brain level of sophistication just yet instead the current pope has just died and it's time the top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the are killing them one by one seven style they being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some latin themed riddler oh and the last kidnapped cardinal has the anti matter and if he isn't found in time rick will have to go straight to venice next year to see decent frescoes if only there was some latin themed batman to save the okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances a true character okay you know where this is going tom hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years his love interest israeli actress has zero chemistry with either hanks or the screen ewan macgregor plays the personal assistant cabana boy as an irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his lucky charms br br on the plus side stellan skarsgÃ¥rd puts in a fine turn as head of vatican security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its vatican critics in at least one area
<START> i agree with who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating br br examples br br pierre is going to marry his cousin even though his love for her seems very cousin y br br pierre and his stepmother have a rather curious relationship br br pierre lucie and seem to have a triangular relationship and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain br br brother is a bit of a eunuch or is he br br and isabelle who is she really br br overall i think it was worth my time an interesting film and one that makes me want to read melville
<START> not bad performances whoopi plays the wise warm role quite well still the storyline and situations can not be believed forced pc stereotypes at times it is good jews and blacks vs the evil white christians ho hum a typical hollywood fantasy the film does have its moments but it is not one that i would recommend to go out of your way to view
<START> i lack cable vision and no longer have directv so being a rural resident i have to wait for dvd releases being a lover of blondes but not blonds i of course not only have barb wire but i have the complete first season i've not yet found vip or a second season for i have the baywatch hawaiian wedding dvd i have the issues of playboy that pamela denise anderson posed in i could go on i love pamela there is no one or anything that could make me feel guilty about enjoying but there are certain elements that i dislike but live with for other series depict smoking and alcohol consumption too some times but those are my personal peeves and i try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this for me i too was taken aback by the change in animation style but i adapted however the amount of female nudity decreased and that is a big disappointment as one expects a lot of it in a series with a premise like this but then again i adapted one of my favorite episodes of mork mindy was when they got to meet robin williams so of course one of my favorite episodes of is when pamela tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin if there really is a season 2 i hope that i can find it for as a completest i need to complete my collection i recommend this for other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes hey psst blonde blondes are the feminine form for spelling blond your software should already know that
<START> this flick is so bad its beyond belief even for an independent low budget film it just well sucks i can't even believe even troma would put out such crap i have been a fan of some troma flicks for years toxic avenger squeeze play rockabilly vampire to name a few but lloyd come on this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste it features some of the worst acting imaginable i think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good oh wait that is what they did i mean it these characters have negative charisma with any luck the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity as will the special effects people but beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears the script is full of plot holes the size of alaska and there are severe continuity problems the worst part however is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way and this is the most unforgivable sin in film making but don't take my word for it go out and waste four bucks renting it just don't say i didn't warn you
<START> the only reason this movie is not given a 1 awful vote is that the acting of both ida lupino and robert ryan is superb ida lupino who is lovely as usual becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman robert ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character guided only by his disturbed mind changes from one minute to the next seemingly simple and docile suddenly he becomes clever and threatening ms lupino's character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along she could not manage to get out of her of her own house windows didn't open both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key you could not have designed a worse fire trap if you tried she did not take the of having even one extra key nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor i don't know what war her husband was killed in but if it was world war ii the furnishings in her house the styles of the clothes especially the children and the telephone company car are clearly anachronistic i recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find
<START> man were do i start everything about this cartoon from the episodes to the stories script an animation is to me the stupidest and most annoying cartoon that walt disney television animation ever created and made im so glad that both toon disney 2006 and disney channel to stop airing it in the u s as of this may 2008 br br believe me it's a wise choice to skip this out cast and black cloud of a cartoon if you watch it don't say i did not alert an warn you br br your in for a boring and down right dull and confusing time i wish and pray i never even saw 1 episode of this cartoon buzz of star command if i could i would have the part of my brain removed that remembers watching it yes it is and was that bad
<START> when i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of kelly a young and op and coming star actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away she is amazing on screen and i'm really looking forward to see what the future brings her br br the movie it self was good in the sense that it let kelly do her stuff and take the for a ride not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before but a good experience i would recommend this movie if only to see kelly this stage actor takes the screen by storm i give this movie a vote of 7 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie br br and on a last note sorry about my bad english if this is gibberish for you p plz ignore me
<START> i can't believe they do this kind of filth out of a serious theme totally unrealistic they seemed to want it to be highly realistic but all the elements are based on clichÃ©s real propaganda stuff after seeing this an addict probably just want to continue his her career i gave it 2
<START> i rented this movie the other day b c i love romance stories but this has got to be the worst one i have ever seen in my life i find it hard to believe that sam would fall in love with kelley after they've said hardly no more than 2 words to each other when she has a great long time boyfriend who's devoted to her completely i thought kelley was a major jerk throughout the movie and he never changed at all the only good thing about the movie was josh hartnett i thought he did a wonderful acting job and i'm going to start watching more movies of his
<START> it would seem a given but if a viewer forgets context he risks missing an opportunity of enjoyment br br it is easy to from the lofty heights of the 21st century at styles and prices of the great depression years but the intelligent viewer will remember that magic word context and better understand and thus enjoy accidents will happen br br among the actors ronald reagan again showed himself a good looking and personable guy and again gave a right on performance br br a reviewer earlier said gloria blondell played the nasty wife but that was wrong she plays the concession stand clerk who has a crush on the reagan character eric gregg but keeps hands off as long as he is married br br gloria was cute not as lushly beautiful as her sister joan she was still attractive and a good actress perhaps her looking somewhat like joan was a detriment to having a more successful career and it is certainly our loss br br sheila was mrs gregg and played it well br br other actors included dick purcell and the great earl got to play something besides a villainous cowboy br br again most of the players never attained the household name status many of them deserved but they by gosh gave good performances here in a story that is still current
<START> one of my favorites non mgm musicals it's a classic rita hayworth is in top form her beauty leaps out of the screen gene kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph phil silvers is the perfect second bananas and eve arden injects this movie with a lot of class br br the structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why in this era where major broadway shows come from the movies cover girl hasn't been adapted to theatre
<START> fi i saw the d i in 1957 two and a half years later i joined the corps br br web and company got it as right as they could in boot in was more like in fact exactly like the boot camp shown in full metal jacket yes a black recruit in my training platoon was called snowball i was called stick because i was skinny as a rail every recruit had a nickname some rather vile that stuck with him through his service in the corps getting smacked or knocked on your ass when you screwed up was sop drop and give me fifty got to be ho hum then it turned into drop and give me two hundred br br the d i 's were a bunch of sadistic bastards but it was a controlled sadism and with a primary purpose of keeping us stupid alive when we hit combat 200 years of experience was ingrained in that sadism and everything the d i did or said had a purpose geared to his mission br br a bad d i gets grunts killed a good d i though seemingly the world's biggest asshole keeps 'em alive you can't kill the enemy if you're dead br br in case you didn't know the marine corps has one primary mission kill the enemy br br everything else is pure bravo sierra br br usmc ret
