<START> had it with the one who raised you since when you were young you just want her gone from your life that woman is your mother you should respect her you should honor her whether she's in sick or well but that in times it can be aggravating especially when she becomes very overbearing that's how owen danny devito had to deal with in throw momma the train his momma anne ramsey 1929 88 is one of the worst he trying his best to be a writer and she is everything but grateful calls him a clumsy poop a and fat and stupid for his friend larry donner billy crystal he has his own woman problems his ex wife she trying to discredit him so what did owen do push her overboard what does he do help return the favor get rid of mrs lift in the kitchen scene i liked it where owen called larry cousin patty and momma said you don't have a cousin patty and owen shouts you lied to me and el larry with the frying pan then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill momma lift that is thwarted and she kicks larry off the train well everything back to normal the ex wife lives but momma kicked the bucket on her own maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways a fun movie it is and the cast is great a classic 5 stars
<START> this is a really bad waste of your time i would probably rather go watch some documentary than this it's really that bad br br the acting is really terrible and you can tell that the producers had a low budget because of the terrible picture quality it's by far on the low end of the scale don't waste your money on it br br i have a really hard time believing the person who made this movie that it would fare well i had to watch it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the kids even the kids 3 4 6 and 8 all thought it was pretty boring br br i agree with the other commenter spongebob would be a lot better to watch than this br br overall just don't watch it don't don't
<START> the on me is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the stooges' 23 years of shorts the reason is understandable by today's standards this film can be considered racist for this reason it is rarely shown if ever on television br br let me just state that for the record the japanese seen in the film were not soldiers they were japanese americans sent to a relocation center during world war ii they were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this film by all accounts including the us government who made an apology and in the 1980s japanese americans during world war ii were as loyal and hardworking as any american their imprisonment during this time is a dark blot in american history br br there are some stooge laughs in this film but the memories of how japanese americans were treated during this time sullies the entertainment value let's not confuse the loyal japanese americans with their representation in this film as evildoers loyal japanese americans and the world war ii era evil empire of japan are not synonymous 2 out of 10
<START> the couch trip is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the '80s in this case dan aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist and he goes to beverly hills to sub for charles grodin most of the movie's humor springs from their satirical look at beverly hills and people's empty lives there a woman has a power struggle with her maid br br it's the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time don't expect any kind of religious experience but you'll most likely laugh a lot at how the beverly hills people flaunt their wealth also starring walter matthau donna dixon arye gross and victoria jackson of uhf
<START> the man with the golden arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic and in some respects the message the tragedy of heroin addiction it's nowhere near a great film but its importance lies in otto preminger's dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism what i liked is that it's not so much an expose of junkies if you want the best expose of that read naked lunch if you can get through it anyway besides the point but the nature of the urban environment frankie machine lives he expects after he gets out of prison for dealing to go on the straight and narrow to become a drummer in a band and make it legit as a musician but he has his crippled wife who can't work and needs money and often complains and then there's the old neighborhood he can't escape seeing louie darren mcgavin who is still doing back room card games and yes pushing dope like mean streets it's hard to escape the minutia unless you leave br br but then again it's hard for frankie machine not to try and operate naturally in this urban quarter it's just that he can't escape the temptation of junk when he's booked on a phony theft charge with his friend he sees a junkie freaking out and it puts back the fear of going back on into his clean self and personifying frankie is sinatra and i can't see anyone else who could've played him even original choice brando he fits into the neighborhood and seems like the kind of guy who should be a step ahead of the game but there's also a vulnerability to sinatra that he pulls out wonderfully and by the time we see him going in molly's apartment it's believable even if it's not the kind of thing those from 'my' generation would think of heroin i e trainspotting and certainly requiem for a dream if for nothing else you want to watch the movie to see what happens to sinatra as this character br br the flaws however come in some of the other performances though it's a little tricky eleanor parker seems to be overacting for a good portion of the movie fooling frankie that she's really crippled when in reality she can walk and is fooling him for one reason or another but then it becomes clearer as it goes along she's supposed to be nuts and nuts with jealousy and on that level it starts to get better meanwhile kim novak is good though not vertigo worthy as the possible girl in the side but more like the voice of reason in the story then there's a detective who might be one of the most one note characters performances ever and also sparrow frankie's nerdy friend and the characters of louie and and they're all played as one might expect them to actually mcgavin is better than ok as far as casting other talent around sinatra preminger doesn't do all that great and frankly some scenes kind of fall flat br br but there's a lot of fascination in the man with the golden arm and not just as some dated piece of sociological interest it works as compelling drama and as a message piece conveyed without being preachy or campy it's a genuine article just not exceptional
<START> well i am so glad i watched this on hbo instead of paying for it in the theaters or video store the movie has some points but if you want to make it a worthwhile movie i suggest that you become what the main characters are called stoners br br 2 10
<START> other than john this movie was absolutely terrible the lacey chabert and andrew love story was as clichÃ©d as possible full of unbelievably bad lines about how her parents wouldn't ever let them be together and super hammy longing looks none of the emotion had any depth or reality whatsoever the two accented characters dean edwards as rupert and whoever it was playing the gun expert once they saw how bad the accents were couldn't they have decided to just drop them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid giving the audience headaches apparently not i don't even know where to start with the editing particularly the sound editing if you hate obvious over dubbing as much as i do don't watch this that being said was great off the bat i'll admit that i'm a huge office fan and that's why i rented this but he's quite entertaining as the off the wall friend with crazy ideas he's got a clichÃ©d role but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible the ending was awful just flat out terrible the idea of the robbery gone awry had potential but floundering around after being shot all the way to his studio to fall ontop of a painting of chabert which looks nothing like her is the most cringe worthy scene
<START> this turned out all right and looks interesting however as it goes on the attempts at creating emotions between the characters is so inept that it really turns the horror off and is an insult to serious viewers the story this is based on i walked with a zombie is probably much better although unfortunately i havenÂ´t seen it yet ritual looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo but in reality it has turned out very poorly which is a shame itÂ´s hard to say what is wrong with it i guess there are just too many inept scenes and it is hard to believe for example in the between alice who is called alice like the girl who supposedly inspired lewis carrol to call his heroine alice and the younger brother absolutely nothing has been built up between them and then in the end they get married anyway this looks great and it was worth a look but the movie is just so poorly performed 3 10
<START> have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve here's hoping that the dvd will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent perhaps overall the movie is a little long but may miles thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary good for the actors i am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot may miles thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors
<START> surely one of the lamest shows ever to be produced on these shores and thats saying something even many of the lead actors didn't stick around for the duration the fact that it ran for eight years is a sad indictment on the average intelligence and cultural nous of the aussie viewer it went round and round in circles with repetitive gags and poorly drawn characters arthur macarthur for god's sake did they actually pay the writers of this show i wonder if anyone checked their qualifications there were tired gags about rural people and second rate farce situations that were poor imitations of a thousand english and us sitcoms that had gone before i think that's what i hate about it so much that it appears no one involved wanted to make it memorable original or clever instead opting for the lowest common denominator each time
<START> i had seen this movie when i was a boy before wwii and was surprised that the local library had a copy saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was this is an example of a movie that was not a a movie no editing poor script weak acting and not much directing should not even be as high as a b had a laugh at how jaded i've become over the years seems to me i thought it was good when i originally saw it
<START> anybody interested what black film making was like in the 70's watch this film some the dialog in this film is so funny ie the summary of my submission also watch out for the boom mic to show up in some of the scenes as well as some of the best karate action ever don't take this movie seriously or you will be disappointed go into it with an open mind and step into the world of one the the baddest mutha in the world dolemite editing wise its put together like it was sliced with a razor but once again this film is so much more than what you see in the movie it has influenced the black community in ways you cant understand
<START> one would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number and sure it's an interesting subject can a person become so obsessed by something marginal as a simple number that he completely loses touch with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid br br well perhaps someone will make a movie about that sometime this one unfortunately doesn't have anything to do with the above never mind what the trailers or even the movie itself would like you to believe i would like to say that this number is just a macguffin but it isn't even that it's pointless a gimmick a hook for unsuspecting audience br br well what is the movie about a dog catcher carrey who becomes obsessed with a cheesy noir crime book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life there sure the character in the book detective sigh is for some reason obsessed with number 23 and carrey himself becomes obsessed and starts seeing the number everywhere but it's just padding and totally irrelevant to the story in fact you can cut out all the 23 references and have the main character s obsess about cheese or something and you'll have the exactly same story it is painfully obvious that all the 23 stuff was written in waay after the story was already finished rejected and sent for rewrites br br which would be ok i guess if the movie wasn't dull dull dull half of the movie is narrated for chrissakes you aren't watching the movie you are listening to jim carrey narrating the movie about a quarter in carrey starts reading the book and from then until the horribly clichÃ© ending we are forced to watch real life scenes from dog life where nothing happens interspersed with narrated artsy film noir ish book scenes which will either leave you snickering or just plain depressed it's like a poor man's sin city with all the violence cut out narrated by carrey and shown in slow motion ugh br br this is a simple case of a c movie script somehow being filmed with an a movie cast probably because of the number 23 hook which i guess sounded intriguing enough on paper to warrant the premium hollywood treatment however since as i said already the movie is about number 23 as much as it is about cheese production in switzerland one cannot feel anything but cheated br br i give the movie 3 out of 10 because i guess it didn't insult my intelligence as much as forsaken did or made me downright suicidal like battlefield earth did and the bottom of the scale must be reserved for abominations like those but fear not this is still a pretty lousy flick
<START> i agree with some of your comments but i have to disagree on a couple of things first this film is nothing like the cars that ate paris not imho nothing like it br br i think the film had elements of surrealism but i think the basic approach of the film maker is not surrealist per se therefore its not really like cars paris i think more like a weird euro work with some scenes bearing the hallmark of wierd not surreal br br secondly i think the music by is brilliant they used whistling that old sound from country and western records and its better than most aussie films which usually team the film maker up with a dumb sounding indy band that the company wants to push br br as for the name of the film i don't know why it's called modern love i was kinda hoping for david bowie to appear dressed in drag and lipstick opps i'm starting to show my age
<START> i have seen most of the tarzan episodes certainly the rated x with o'keeffe bo derek which is totally deplorable br br i have seen this version several times since it was originally shown br br all the cast had memorable parts great acting the ape sequences br br last night i viewed same on spanish station and other than some french dialog all in spanish br br as far as hudson not wanting andie's voice he did nothing until the very end he viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach br br it seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that hudson attacked andie the story line in the movie was that she was an american cousin the last time i checked carolina was in the usa br br she was beautiful in movie and her eyes and gorgeous hair alabaster skin mystified all us males she did not have to resort to bo's level br br she has remained a lady throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie half her life ago as a starting point her performance sincerity made this movie enjoyable believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty br br great sending point for sir richardson he did steal the movie
