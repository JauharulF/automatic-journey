<START> i quote below words from my favor writer paulo as the comment for this movie br br when you really want something all the universe in helping you to achieve it br br it is too easy to forget who we really are and what we desire to do in life because there are always too many comments and advice surrounding us to tell safety i had almost forgot what the passion feel like despite of the adventure will take me out of safety zone i truely believe the fear is just the price that i need to pay for the coming brand new journey in life br br thanks for inspiring me with this lovely story it is the blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is that is the most love from the light of soul
<START> i managed to see this at what i think was the second screening in the world a few days after its opening at the dublin international film festival while i was attending another film two nights later at the same theater i saw brendan gleeson paul and the rest of the cast crew at another promotional screening of studs br br i have to say that i was bitterly disappointed with the film i was by no means expecting a masterpiece but what was presented to me i believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into before i continue two things i accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations here this is simply not the case secondly i know that it was based on a play which i haven't read but have been informed that it isn't a shimmering piece of literature but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the film br br my main problem with the film is the script forget that it was based on a play as a sports comedy it simply doesn't work the down and out team are trying to win a football cup few of the games are shown when they are it is very short and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements having read so far you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a charlatan of a manager and his hopeless team it certainly does not achieve this i'm not even sure if it was aiming to any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral overall i found the script lacking in many respects br br i do think the performances and the music were good and technically the film was well made but aside from those points which should be expected from any irish film at this stage i left the theater feeling very disappointed br br my judgment may seem harsh but i do think there is some hope for a strong national irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument as studs has become a recommended dublin film i was part of the audience at that screening most people would seem to be disagreeing with me so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film
<START> i decided to watch this movie in order to fall asleep it kept me awake so it was interesting however it was pretty bland br br the acting was good i don't think any of the actors did a bad job mickey rourke is as believable as an over the hill hit man can be the dialogue in this movie does not provide much opportunity for these actors to show off their full potential but they still shined br br the atmosphere was great music was good and colors matched the mood that the director wanted to paint for the viewers even the weather enhanced the mood of the movie everything was well done br br the failures of this movie are in its story development the storyline with the mafia vs blackbird doesn't get enough attention the storyline for carmen and wayne's divorce doesn't get explained the fbi seems to work extra fast here is there no paperwork for all these processes is it really that easy to dig up your brother's body from his grave burn the corpse and have it be identified as you there are too many loops in the storyline for me to give this movie anything higher than a 4 out of 10 rating i wouldn't recommend this movie to people unless they're really bored and have smoked some really good weed even if wow is down for maintenance go find something better to do than watch this movie
<START> aunt cora had always been tactless and her well bred family ignored the remark she made after her brother richard's funeral he was murdered wasn't he they remembered it the next day when cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet br br for some reason the poirot movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book i was disappointed about the changes made in cards on the table my favourite poirot book after the funeral is my 2nd favourite poirot book and i was scared the story would be destroyed it wasn't the movie was nearly page for page faithful throughout right down to the killer's motive all the actors were wonderful but my favourite has got to be monica dolan who gives a great performance as miss gilchrist the companion to the late aunt cora without a doubt the best poirot movie ever
<START> scarlet coat like most revolution flicks wasnt well received but is nears perfection in the art of movie making a great character study of john andre the heroic redcoat who is revered by both friend and foe for courage scarlett coat also probes the duality of the undercover agent as a counterfeit traitor bolton befriends andre and undertakes a high level penetration of british intelligence yet he defends andre in andre's the film captures the moral ambiguity of the spy br br how much of the spy's world is real which reality does he belong to the reality of his or the reality which the cover story creates br br andre's capture and is a success for bolton in his mission beyond that wahington would have ever demanded the mission was merely to identify the traitor in us ranks bolton has knocked out enemy intelligence as well yet bolton mourns the death of the man he was sent to destroy br br ann francis plays a stock american character compliant with the british but willing to engage them in a war of wits br br a movie well worth revisiting
<START> my wife and i watched this abortion from its beginning i hated it immediately but my wife became hooked on it for a couple of years for me it just got worse and worse and the characters were all without question dreary and depressing without any redeeming features my wife then grew tired of it and we stopped watching altogether occasionally i catch a clip of it or pass through it when channel surfing there is always someone yelling at someone else or doing something dreadful there never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind that was always my main gripe with it when we first watched it no humour the writers seem to have no idea about drama they seem to think conflict is drama and of course that is only one element of it light and shade is sorely needed and actors who can bring something to it i am sure the actors in eastenders are competent but they have nothing to work with it must be the most depressing acting job in showbiz i fail to understand why the british public watch it and love it what on earth does it say about our psyche i have heard it said that it is just like real life its nothing like my life or anyone's life i know otherwise we would be flinging ourselves from high buildings or under public transport the themes it tackles are far from family viewing but still are shown pre watershed i love series like breaking bad or the wire but i would not expect to see them at 7 30 or 8 00 in the evening the programme is trash writ large and should be avoided at all cost
<START> does anyone care about any of the characters in this film or for that matter what happens to them i doubt it that is the key problem for a tragedy to work we have to care about at least one of the characters and none of them inspire any sympathy or appear to have any redeeming qualities at all br br what may have worked in the 16th century certainly does not work in one can only assume 'post apocalyptic if that was indeed what it was meant to be the problem is the characters in post apocalyptic liverpool whilst still driving around in cars using mobile phones and watching television have reverted to speaking in shakespearian language with a liverpudlian dialect oh dear bad enough you might think but this often lapsed into pure scouse with comments such as lah are you a cockney and was that a announcement during one of the scenes filmed in the underground well the good news is that in post apocalyptic liverpool the trains are still running br br the characters without exception are badly drawn wooden and more like on the lines of the joker penguin in batman and robin except there is no real storyline to speak of or if there is it is one that doesn't work in a modern setting where half the sets are gloomy and 'blade and the other half are fluorescent garish or just 21st century normal costumes are also mixed up with half wearing their everyday clothes parkers are big in post apocalyptic liverpool apparently and the other half wearing costumes from the leftovers of a fancy dress party br br the film explores the ideas of lust incest and revenge in the most inane fashion imaginable the tragedy is that this film was made at all br br
<START> i love this movie it can make me laugh which is kinda hard to do this movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever it doesn't warp the characters like other movies out there everyone is in character and has a role to play br br the movie focuses around buster and babs going down river after a flood courtesy of buster to plucky going on a trip with hilarious stuff running around torturing animals as usual fifi following her crush around for an autograph and shirley and going to the movies br br in my own personal opinion i didn't like the buster and babs segments that much although they had some notable dialogue and jokes i have got to say the plucky and hampton parts were the best family is hilarious i especially like uncle stinky fifi in the hotel was also hilarious i love the actor cameos during this scene d br br probably the most famous part in this movie again imho is when and shirley are in the movie theater lol you've got to see it to appreciate it and when and plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish br br although this movie moved slowly during the buster babs parts the rest is pure gold i rate this movie 8 10 show this to your kids one day or even adults yourselves watch this movie you won't regret it
<START> i watched this movie so that you don't have to i have great respect for kris kristofferson but what was he thinking he did this for scale br br at least the film's title practices truth in advertising since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film adding to the confusion kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn't sure if genevieve character really existed this does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story br br the making of feature was far more interesting than the movie itself it explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie even as the film is being shot br br to it's credit this movie is visually pleasing and doesn't in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over too bad the money wasn't spent on a better project
<START> did the first travesty actually make money this is another sequel along the lines of another stakeout that no one asked for but we've received it anyway the sequel is like its predecessor completely brain dead it's also pretty disgusting remember the dinner scene to think i almost felt sorry for ritter yasbeck and warden did they need the money that much
<START> ok when i say wow i mean jesus please help me i have an old vhs copy that was printed before troma got a copy of the title the movie is about an alien crash landing on earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion watch out and by that i mean watch out for those special effects there is an amazing number of mistakes the acting is terrible but i'd say the only one putting forth any effort would be the sheriff the film itself is really grainy and poorly lighted in one particular scene it is day outside and then the shot shows the night beast shooting his gun with night behind him then it shows day again shakes head i usually like low budget horror films but i had to force myself to finish it because i never watch a movie without finishing it the only accomplishment this film achieved was an alien that wasn't stereotypical so for that and only for that i give it a 3 out of 10 br br don't watch this movie if you've had a bad day you'll be even more depressed at the failed attempt this movie makes
<START> we see at the beginning of little dieter needs to fly dieter the subject of the film an obsessive compulsive or at least that's what he seems to be by way of constantly opening closing doors and with his large stock pile of food in the cellar in a way director werner herzog sets up a central question in a manner of speaking to why dieter is like this well in fact he's not necessarily obsessive compulsive as he is just well prepared and why shouldn't he be after the life he's lived aside from the most dark and exhilarating and frightening and just downright haunting story of survival that's the core of the picture the back story to dieter is fascinating too own childhood for example was already a slog from the start being in post war poor in a family without much food or prospects eating wallpaper for the blue in the walls but enter in a passion an un yielding desire which of course is part of herzog's bread butter and love of man in his films which is flying and for dieter there was nothing else but to fulfill this what it ends up leading to after becoming an american citizen is more than he could've bargained for br br dieter is one of herzog's most compelling quirky and compassionately observed figures in his whole career a man who's memory is scarred by brutal memories of his time being a vietnam pow though at the least it provides for some of the most compelling storytelling in any documentary of the last 20 years ironically the storytelling comes through unlike in the wild blue yonder mostly in lots and lots of exposition from dieter on some of the most minute details of his time in the different prison camps the torture tactics the bugs the brutal wretched violence and threats like with the wedding ring tale and leading into the most interesting and sad portions with his best friend duane they escaped the prisons together but found that their journey to reach cambodia would not be so easy now through most of this the talking does something that is enthralling which is that as dieter goes through his stories and occasionally does re enactments in fashion herzog could only do with dieter already middle aged being led in handcuffs et all through the jungle one can picture all of this in the mind it all becomes even more vivid to try and get these little details and the intensity of it all together into a form of reality that herzog keeps these portions simple and knows when to hold dieter back in his answers makes him all the more a key figure of interest he's not ever totally 'normal' but unlike a timothy you wont think ever really about laughing at him either br br so along with his hero whether of war or not is hard to say as dieter disputes that claim as saying the ones who died were the real heroes typical but perhaps quite true herzog his film with a mix of old stock footage when detailing early life the period footage of ww2 scenes and post german rubble is always a captivating sight and with herzog gets up a notch in his timing and assemblage with music and in capturing the footage of vietnam in aerial viewings of jungles and fields herzog is also very wise at not injecting politics much at all into the proceedings there's no 'i was used by the americans' or whatever thrown into the mix there's even a sense that dieter doesn't hold too much of a grudge with everything that happened to him that it's just what happens in time of war and of course he was dropping bombs on people from his plane now through much of these harrowing and even in the smaller bits involving what went on in prisons bathrooms and the scraps of food it's always harrowing luckily herzog keeps a level of humor in check as well one of my very favorite scenes in the film where herzog breaks away for a moment from dieter is when he shows a film used for american soldiers meant to show what should happen in case they get abandoned in the jungle alone with all of the gear that they could possibly have including a knife a flare gun and a very fast helicopter to come around and this is put to hilariously dead pan voice over work br br yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis and how one can't ever really imagine what it's like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of collateral in war time dieter aside from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have and herzog ends the film on a wonderfully somber elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes knows what it is to have to survive at all costs but yet as well as in many of herzog's protagonist driven films there's the near spirit that will keep on enduring if one's strong enough even through horrid moments the fate of and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter is he american or a spy they ask on the chopper dieter is such a man with a spirit and he's given via herzog a fantastic tragic creative well shot albeit maybe too short tribute to his life and of course it pumps me up even more for the upcoming dramatization rescue dawn
<START> this is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in florida and the court case that follows what this film shows is how corrupt the american police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife the star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along fascinating stuff 7 out of 10

<START> what can i say i couldn't sleep and i came across this movie on mtv i started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many anti drug movies do but i got sucked into this movie and i couldn't stop watching nick stahl did an amazing job with his character and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching i was interested in purchasing the soundtrack to the movie or even the movie itself and mtv com was no help at all but believe it or not amazon com is taking pre orders for the august 5th release of the movie on dvd i know i had a hard time tracking it down and i'm sure other people might have had the same problem i'm buying my own copy so i can drool over nick stahl while bawling my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline
