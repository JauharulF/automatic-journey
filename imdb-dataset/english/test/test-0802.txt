<START> hooray for korean cinema last year i saw and nowhere to hide now i catch up with hur jin ho's directorial debut christmas in august the variety of themes and level of achievement speak highly of a national cinema ripe for discovery this film's major themes are death and love the graceful and thoughtful way jung won han suk copes with his impending death and the sublimation of his desires toward shim ha out of true love for her i was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions shielding from unnecessary pain without rejecting her br br the success of this type of film is predicated on the skill of the actors han and shim excel being both quite expressive yet naturalistic a number of secondary characters jung relatives friends and clients are quickly delineated to enrich the story without detracting from its main focus to live is to love but all things must pass pain subsides life goes on
<START> i've taken another look at this film and still consider it pretty good chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who really can act she appears occasionally in soft core such as body of love and lady stories on showtime i thought nicole did ok too with her nice body and charming accent too bad she's not in more films
<START> the movie is not that bad ringo lam sucks i hate when van damme has love in his movies van damme is good only when he doesn't have love in his movies
<START> this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen i always liked chuck norris in films but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss marker i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting i know an african american who looks like this guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude br br chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets i think this show started great but lost steam as time went on br br they should have dumped chucks side kick
<START> of all the actresses in film today kristin scott thomas would be my choice if i had to select one for on a desert island br br i could watch her simply say sitting in a chair for a couple of hours so it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films br br however i did enjoy this movie and its story per se more than that indicated by the average ranking among the many persons previously commenting on this site br br harrison ford is not one of the actors though whose performances i enjoy most but he's one of a handful who have reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per film so who am i to argue br br ford though is often droll in his acting style and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an and a shot of caffeine and random hearts is in this grouping br br his obsession in probing the losses which both he and thomas have endured with regard to their linked spouses is understandable given his profession as a detective but not to the level presented here although not far it crossed the line into the annoying category br br however most of the scenes after he and thomas became involved were interesting and well played br br this film could have been a 9 but i'd lower it a couple of levels based upon ford's overall performance and and another because it contained a bit more of the extraneous sub plot elements than seemed required
<START> this is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art this is an oblivious labour of love by the schrader brothers about the life of yukio mishima that is full truly artistic elements the movie jumps from color to black and white past to present fictional works by mishima to him all without being confusing in the least bit the only thing that gets me is that the entire movie with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts is in japanese still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won criterion if you are reading this this is a film that should be released under your imprint with as much extras as possible this film truley deserves more 10 10
<START> a complete zero out of four one worst sums up awful actually more words come to mind ridiculous third rate and terrible this is one of amitabh's worst movies ever he prances around in a cheap leather jacket and equally cheap tinsel foil zorro style mask with what appears to be wings on the sides br br the movie is set in ancient persia or arabia and is characteristically un historical for an indian movie as stated above a leather jacket from k mart with straps did not exist 400 years ago unless all my history teachers were wrong br br rishi also does his patented cross dressing in this movie far from being funny it is very embarassing to watch what could possess the son of the legendary raj kapoor to flay the memory of his house like this on screen br br on the plus side if you want a real laugh go ahead and watch this film the glaring inconsistencies in the plot and costumes are no match for the awful dialogues and shoddy acting
<START> this is about as good as gone with the wind was i love this movie i could watch it over and over again scarlett always gets what she wants no matter what the cost she tries real hard to forget rhett but she just can't do it she loves him so much this is a story of real true love it started in gone with the wind and ended up in this movie the only real way to end this movie for real true love was to have scarlett and rhett back together at the end and thats the way it ended with them back together with their daughter what more could you ask for there's not a better ending to this great love story than this what else can i say about this great movie
<START> i have just seen the movie 15 park avenue which was the first night presentation movie in the asia society human rights film festival in new york i was really moved by the subject matter of this movie and also the excellent portrayal of by the lead actor konkona sen sharma i have just one word for everyone who is reading this comment run to get a copy of this gem and watch it my sincere thanks to director sen who has done a excellent job again movie like this comes on once in a blue moon and i was lucky enough to see this movie on screen and also took part in a after movie discussion question and answer session with konkona sen sharma in a simple word a wonderful experience
<START> the skeleton of the story is that the main character needs to win a public kung fu tournament with high stakes the flesh of the story consists of lots of fighting a love triangle betrayals rivalries and revenge br br there is a lot to this story the main character is very likeable as an even tempered mild mannered and very tough country boy a good versus bad movie is only as good as the villains and the main villains are tough and smart not to mention ugly devious and tricky br br if there is one weakness it's the scene where the fiance of the main character is imagining her and the protagonist running towards each other in a flowery field and hugging when they meet i thought i was watching the sound of music for a second and nearly lost hope for the movie luckily the movie recovered quickly with a fight scene
<START> a montage prologue quite obviously manufactured by the blessed maniacs who actually chose to distribute this thing tries to convince us that the comic impact of this staggeringly incompetent bit of nothing is entirely deliberate don't you believe it this is to lloyd kaufman as andy warhol is to herschel gordon lewis it is so in its project of torturing its hypothetical audience that it seems like some kind of misanthropic art installation only it can't be because it is so completely bereft of self consciousness as obnoxious and ugly as things or frozen scream this manages to up the ante by recycling itself with a maddeningly bald insistence that has to be seen to be believed a hitchcock style shot by shot analysis of say the attack on the girls might yield twenty edits and perhaps three minutes of footage only the sequence is ten minutes long you want to believe that this started life as a slightly more bearable short subject except if you took away the repetition what's left would be far less fascinating eg when the does enter the room he only inspires extended highly apathetic utterly blank stares from his imminent offscreen victims repeat this scenario about four times in marginally varied settings bridge these with perhaps thirty lines of dialogue total offer up actors even more hateful and lethargic than those in the above mentioned classics and grace us with a monster comprising gauze ketchup and one yellow spock ear and you've got a movie too mind boggling to refuse a working definition of bad i'm proud to own it
<START> when i say worse i mean less entertaining todd sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last zombie bloodbath which makes the movie even less tolerable in the last movie there were no special camera effects where in this one we are treated to shaky cam and constant switching to black and white also this is called zombie bloodbath despite the fact that the zombies are barely in this one the movie starts in 1945 where some satanists kill a violent burglar and put him up as a scarecrow back in modern time some kids have a car problem and go to a house the same house in which the satanist murder happened some mean people try to rape the kids or something and they bring the scarecrow burglar back to life who comes back with some zombies and now talks like darth vader mr sheets amped up the language and lessened the violence if you want to see what a bad movie is check this out br br my rating bomb 96 mins not rated contains violence and language
<START> as i sit back after watching wong kar wai's 1994 movie ashes of time Â more specifically the 2008 re edit and re release with the word slapped on the end of the title Â i wonder what went wrong i wonder why the film just didn't work out at all i wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book in particular what was it about the film which dragged it down and made it the director's worst film of his career br br well it's not too hard to figure out really let me just say that it truly is a shame that kar wai so abruptly went down this hell hole of mediocrity and poorness in moviedom especially considering the fact that in the same year he released chungking express one of his enduring and an absolutely sublime film so Â what went wrong it would be suitable to consider ashes of time as somewhat of an experimental film our director essentially places his own inimitable style of film making and places it in an entirely different setting mood and atmosphere what results is a catastrophic film which is all over the place and simply does not work out hence it would be even wiser to call ashes of time a failed experiment bold audacious and innovative but a failure nonetheless br br let me elaborate those who have seen the films of mr kar wai a hong kong born film auteur who's made his mark on the art house world since his debut in the late 80's will know that there is an overriding aesthetic which binds all of his movies together essentially and frankly speaking they're all colourful thought provoking amiable subtly humorous and meaningful of life love and loss the same formula is transposed into ashes of time however the regular setting of hong kong is ridden of and in its stead we're placed into the setting of ancient china and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clansmen br br intertwined into this quasi adventure historical caper is the typical kar wai love story this time involving an elegiac hit man who has moved to the middle of the desert and is carrying out contract killings however i must stop myself there description of characters is a useless thing to do why because not a single character in ashes of time is worth mentioning or nothing what a bland cast and what a waste of talent the case of ashes of time contains nearly all regular kar wai collaborators br br not only that but the film is essentially endless incessant rambling in a horrendous almost non existent narrative structure one of the main reasons why detractors of ashes of time berate it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever let alone a semblance or an indication of one you can definitely see what they're getting at even from the first two three minutes maybe less of the film perhaps it's just the atypical setting of ancient china which is unaccustomed and inappropriate for kar wai's typical film making style i like to think however unfortunate it may be that mr kar wai just stuffed up big time here br br one thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in ashes of time albeit said compliment being starkly isolated is another director trademark Â wonderful colourful and blissful aesthetics what joyous colour is composed on screen what glorious textures are painted for us and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie we can at least take this as a sign that wong kar wai is still there at heart and it's just the film which is so atypical and buries his usually commendable nuance although the visuals aren't enough for us to fully absolve kar wai for this disastrous venture they're enough to make the film worthwhile Â and at least we don't walk out of the movie in a completely and totally cantankerous mood now that there's something we can think of nicely br br the film is essentially a art' film following in the style of say legendary japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa however one thing differentiates kar wai's film from kurosawa's best and that's that in the japanese director's films everything gels together and simply works in ashes of time nothing seems to work kar wai's attempt to make a genuinely profound wuxia film let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms is a futile endeavour br br kar wai claims that making ashes of time exhausted him and that he needed time to clear his head it must've certainly been a effort on his behalf as his are embodied in the film and transferred to us directly Â i mean just watching the film is an exhausting effort and now i need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie going experience
<START> earth final conflict began like a new world a new vision from the creator of star trek something fresh and unique full of great elements a very good cast with an extremely credible kevin kilner as william boone an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances but soon the character of kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race soon this resistance group begin to discover the sinister plans of the using the humans in they own problems to survive they own destruction as i said before the show began great all was almost perfect including characters like the original was a big mystery because he seems to be a nice creature but at the same time he has his own evil plans manipulating some people in earth soon came who wasn't bad but mark the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first big enemy of humans the incarnation of evil killing what could be something greater in the first seasons ends in a great way with the dead of boone and the second shows a new lead character liam an hybrid being of human and another alien race with some very interesting powers he replace kilner character in a good way so another storylines make it better including the conflict with the and the but as i said lines before the evilness of begin to take more importance so the new conflicts were less realistic as the same with time the whole great storyline of the alien roots of liam where almost totally erased the same with other things of the previous seasons so when the final season began the original earth final conflict was just an almost forgotten dreams all the magic was missing just to let some vain intents to keep alive the show including the return of kilner and liam for a few episodes the final episode was just the evidence of how bad was the show with so many bad changes to think the writers of some episodes didn't know anything about the first stories it was one of the worst end i have ever seen in a tv show a real shame because earth final conflict began like something unique fresh the stories the cast after watch so many show from usa something from canada from the mind of the creator of star trek was wonderful but in the end all change to worse i hope someday someone make a remake of this show of course using nothing from season fourth and fifth except the cast everyone were perfect in his work i still can dream in a better things
<START> i just came back from seeing this awesome movie i can relate to it so much it reminded me when my sister had to go to college we had to move from place to place and my mom acts like adele august boys might not like this movie since it brings tears to your eyes one of the best real life movies i've ever seen and natalie portman rules 10 10
