<START> this is a really sad and touching movie it deals with the subject of child abuse it's really sad but mostly a true story because it happens everyday elijah wood and joseph play the two children or lorraine bracco a single mother who just tries to make a home for them while living with her parents a man who likes to be called the king comes into their life he hits the youngest boy bobby but the two brothers vow not to tell their mother but finally she finds out after the bobby is hurt badly the end kind of ruined it for me because it is so totally unbelievable but except for that i love the movie
<START> one more classic performance by and his team they can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an all time classic the war and its impacts in sri lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect no wonder he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role he plays and it needs real to act as a father for three kids when he is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry music by ar rahman makes the movie a special one for those who love melodies above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times
<START> one of the best silent dramas i've seen as dark and shadowy as anything the german produced but featuring performances that were quite understated and naturalistic for the day no camera mugging and no unintentional laughs due to wild eyed arm waving histrionics gave a convincing performance as the drunken mean spirited and frightening david holm br br set mostly at night in a dingy swedish slum the film had a very claustrophobic set bound feel to it aided by the low key lighting and extensive use of br br there was a deep and typically scandinavian sense of despair and hopelessness to the narrative the film begins in a rather grim present and then we're told david holm's story in a series of flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks a pretty complex story structure for 1921 where his character is offered numerous chances at redemption but he doesn't take them and we know he won't take them because we've seen him die drunk and wretched and mean as ever in the present the penultimate scene is as dark as any i have seen in all of cinema br br the writing and directing is tight and intelligent even by today's standards in several instances skillfully sets the audience up to suspect one thing and then pulls out a surprise the ending might not be such a surprise to some viewers but i didn't see it coming br br this movie deserves a full restoration and dvd release or even a crappy budget release it just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate it br br 9 5 10 which rounds up to 10 10
<START> i just have to say that this was the third worst movie i have ever seen right after the attack of the murder 3 and starship troopers 2 it wasn't just dialogs or the paper walls or even the guns shots which just disappeared with no holes in the walls it was the horrible acting no wonder that i have never seen these actors before they all probably slept with the director s i think i'am being nice to this movie now but that is only because i'am to tired from screaming at the movie just saw it my advice is to buy as many dvd's of this movie as you possibly can and burn it so no one ever can see this horrible waste of time money and film ever again
<START> subconscious cruelty has to be one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen still it's extremely grim and gory at times so fans of politically correct mainstream horror garbage shouldn't bother the film mixes many wonderful visuals with plenty of sleaze and gore it is extremely odd vicious and disturbing so fans of bizarre cinema won't be disappointed my favourite segment from subconscious cruelty is human larvae which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister the birthing scene is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten the last segment right brain martyrdom has to be seen to be believed it's incredibly harsh and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and grisly torture we see jesus christ captured by three naked females who mutilate him ripping flesh from his chest licking a wound on his knee and pissing on him there is also a jesus statue with a projection of a swastika on it subconscious cruelty is a truly memorable film that should be seen by fans of extreme cinema check it out
<START> i just watched lonesome dove return to lonesome dove streets of and dead man's walk all excellent this sorry hunk of junk is cheaply done and poorly acted br br in the previous series captain call and gus come off as tough respectable cowboys despite the fact that caption call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over in dead man's walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced texas rangers in comanche moon they are just a couple of chubby rednecks i had to stop watching br br i suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinking pile it's a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise
<START> i'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do i'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is i'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie because i'll be here for ages if i do the storyline is typical and the special effects are below today's standards this is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff as most of us here are little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience if your a casual movie watcher who likes to have a good time when they are watching a flick then this movie is perfect for you lots of fun it would also be a good movie to take a partner to just not for us movie buff's br br 5 out of 10
<START> i just saw it at an advance screening i haven't read the book but heard many good things about it br br the movie was absolutely fantastic very moving with a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters shaun was great it was a complete departure from his usual roles and his acting for those who understand persian dari was incredible br br one thing to notes it that actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies even after seeing the movie several times he was sobbing br br also the animation from the intro was exquisite with names displayed as if it were persian calligraphy very unique at times the translation was not clearly conveying the message efficiently but all in all this was a great movie
<START> head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars the monkees and victor mature or its director co writer bob but also its other co writer and brief cameo jack nicholson as it stands most of them seem to shun it and to outsiders the movie is regarded at best as a curio br br while the t v series was famously based on the antics of the beatles' ' this film is also judged by the same accord yet far from the trite and painfully overrated beatles films and even the dated monkees t v series head has a layer of depth an undercurrent of man's darker nature is at work here and while that may sound like a bizarre thing to say about a manufactured pop band the use of certain themes and images hitting women laughing at cripples and real life footage of a vietcong pow shot dead at point blank range give the film an edge that many films would not dare to aspire to br br there are also the fun moments which range from james bond parodies to 'big and my personal favourite mickey dolenz under by arab soldiers on horseback one of them turns to mickey and hisses ' only for the ' to appear in subtitles the group are aware of their manufactured image in the film 'i'm the dummy i'm always the claims neatly summing up his one dimensional foil role of the series meaning that their characters Â they play acting and not acting here Â are opened out more and consequently are less generic and irritating than they were in the series this level of parody and self awareness even takes on their fab four origins with subtler takes on the maharishi and out and out acknowledgements with a waitress who asks 'well if it isn't god's gift to the eight year are you still paying tribute to ringo starr ' also listen out for whistling fields forever' while in the bathroom br br then there are the songs of course six of them here slightly more psychedelic than usual which may have alienated their fanbase and even a frank zappa cameo wouldn't have turned on an adult audience to their charms at this point probably the best is the charming 'as we go though the first a carol king penned song' interestingly talks of the desire to live while time is ticking away and death gets ever nearer on a lighter note its refrain of 'the is seems to be a direct mickey take of 'i am the br br constantly inventive with direct references to silent film and drug culture perhaps head's finest feature is its narrative structure not the only Â but the most important Â reason why it improves with multiple viewings the story goes left right forwards backwards circular and through several levels of reality in essence a series of sketches hung loosely together its cohesion is tightened by the space time defying plot which hangs its internal logic together by means of flashback dream sequence prison of the mind and remote control channel changer br br with a perfect beginning and end this intelligently written knowing film was not what the pre teen audience was expecting and subsequently suffered a negative critical reception now those expectations have gone this one is in dire need of serious
<START> having just finished reading the book one of a kind a week ago i was thinking this would make a great movie especially now when people know a little about poker and poker players i was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night i had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film i grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation what a major letdown br br all of the intriguing things about stu ungar were skimmed over quickly and instead i was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody ungar may have been a burnt out jerk but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people instinctively that is what made him so fascinating why not focus on that br br and talk about watering down the real truth this guy was excessive about absolutely everything drugs women gambling starvation sleep deprivation he gambled on sporting events from dusk to dawn he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack dens his body was perpetually emaciated and yet if he ever needed money he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards now that's a story br br too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships although his ties with vincent and his daughter were hardly touched on and hardly anything about his drugs use which was exorbitant his insane gambling and his incredible card playing abilities br br probably too late now but i hope someone remakes this film properly i had no problem with imperioli he is excellent the script just left him with nothing interesting to say
<START> hello hello and goodbye but before i go i want to talk to you i just want to quickly mention a few keys points about this film the first being erotica especially homo erotica br br yes well let us begin when a man and a man love each other very much they fuse together in a spectacular not to mention tender explosion of cinema which we call merchant of venice br br the homo erotic love was sensual at worse and even more sensual at best it was hardcore and emotional it touched me inappropriately and i'm pretty sure i touched it back and when no one was looking i touched myself a little too br br i laughed because was denied she was second in line to our friend the homo erotic love oh antonio antoni just toni i love you more than you loved that guy whos name may or may not have contained an b he was well ugly br br antoni was very greasy he lathered his body in an of his own hair grease and sensual juices and proceed to writhe the and present himself to the guy with the name i like the movie in conclusion go see the movie if not for the homo erotic connotations for the love of a man such as antoni just toni
<START> i just saw this on cable i liked it it held my interest and the dramatic choices were good the old couple were very good and good at being subtly creepy the cinematography is not so great but the shabby video also adds to the sense of realism so its a trade off you know at times the girl would hit the new england accent to hard the accent would sort of come and go anyway i thought the film was well done overall though the storyline was strong and dramatic tension was held because you felt their was some subtle mystery going on even though things seemed mundane good job on a low budget another good suny purchase filmmaker way to go
<START> this one kind of is like an earlier movie from 1987 masters of the universe based on the cartoon he man basically you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the action of the movie take place on modern earth well i guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by well i guess i can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie to save money on costumes and sets it is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of in he man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death this movie is forgettable and not very entertaining your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that robert z'dar is in it the only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last marc singer is back and it is sad to seem him in this state the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one and even if it did it came five years to late
<START> one of the best and most inspirational movies about a different culture i've seen in years tragic and touching worth the watch maybe a few times we all know how brutal children can be i know from my own and my brothers experiences as children and this movie hit the nail on the head perfectly the kite running is amazing and i need to do research on the validity of that event even though it is done in cgi it is still amazing and very interesting to maneuver a kite like that with a single string seems impossible but they make it believable anyway this movie has many twists and turns that are i'm sure to many probably easy to figure out but they hit me before i could which makes a great movie for me when you figure out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes it kind of ruins it but this one does it so smoothly that it's hard to guess it even when it happens i'm a guy and i don't mind saying that the tears were flowing at more than one point in this movie
<START> go get your camcorder your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons and you got yourself a film well that's what these guys thought anyway it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in 'nam despite the really corny title the horrible quality the terrible actors and the clichÃ© writing i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen i'm saving that slot for everything with steven seagal chuck norris and jean claude van dam anyhow if you are out of options when it comes to finding new horror films that you haven't seen 1 000 times already as i was and you are debating this one i would still skip this it had absolutely no redeeming qualities this mock serial killer thriller was a weak puny attempt at an even b film if they're really lucky it might make the wal mart 4 50 bin but i highly doubt it
