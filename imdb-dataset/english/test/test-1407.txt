<START> this is a film about passion the passion it depicts is largely misdirected even for the leading man but therein lies the incredible power of this film it shows us that what we believe can be contaminated by nonsense and can even lead us to do things that are destructive to ourselves or others moreover those who try to escape from acquiring passion watch the druggie who visits the studio also risk self destruction br br the world needs to hear the message of this movie more often
<START> where the rivers flow north is a well told story about two peoples' fight to live their own lives in the face of progress and development besides enjoying the movie as entertainment i also learned quite a bit about life in rural new england back in the late 1920s br br the cinematography captured the raw beauty of northern vermont and set the stage while the music brought the movie to life very well done for a low budget locally produced film i found michael j fox's character the weakest in the film but rip torn and cardinal turn in two of the finest performances i've seen in a long time i was saddened she did not get a nod as best actress that year i assume the film was too small a film to be considered
<START> amidst all the many problems that make this a dire piece of celluloid is the stupidest plot device in recent cinema history richard gere determines who the real target is through some form of revelation he does not work anything out it just comes to him when in doubt he's going after the first lady this film blows chunks
<START> i expected a good movie what i got was an even better movie the chemistry between james and smith is just incredible glad to see him in a major motion picture for once br br the movie works because the actors play their parts perfectly will smith is fantastic with his never ending charm kevin james is hilarious and eva mendes well let's just say she plays that bitch sweet annoying role to the best of her ability br br what i loved about the movie was the fact that will smith didn't even have to try to be lovable he just was the date doctor had all the right moves said everything in the most perfect of ways and never ever went over the top br br the funny parts are hilarious and the cute romantic parts are unforgettable br br i totally recommend this movie and no it is not a chick flick
<START> the only time i seem to through imdb comments is when i've seen a duff film i guess i'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me for me then lonesome jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop out hackneyed conclusion so i check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like jim out on a limb alienated as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties yet maybe i should check the settings for the comments presentation since after a while the gushing dies down and i'm relieved to see that mirror my own i feel vindicated it is a rubbish film it doesn't hang together and it does constitute a wasted evening sitting through it praise be to kindred spirits
<START> this is one of the best films i've seen from the silent era sad to say i've yet to see too many with the exception of chaplin keaton stuff very visually brilliant with insanely influential style in editing and composition really unique especially for its time camera angles and extremely hectic editing definitely a must see for the film nerd br br the downside is that it is a bit too in your face about its politics i have no problem with politics in film as long as they are subtle or at least somewhat as a backseat to the story also it's not an entertainment film which is fine but it's not something i'm going to watch a billion times this is art plain and simple like it or not br br worth an a for influence alone but based on personal enjoyment i give it an a
<START> when i was younger this movie always aired on friday night in the summer on channel 40 this was the years before fox was a network and took over the programming i always looked forward to it i'd go grocery shopping with my parents then sit down with my tv dinner and a lady lee cola the only time of the week i was allowed to drink cola and enjoy sure the script is predictably late 70's like little darlings but it's a fun movie and i loved rudy and bill murray coasts with little effort in the movie but he is charming gotta love spaz and those taped glasses pre revenge of the nerds chris makepeace is pretty much the same character he played in my bodyguard but he does it so well
<START> this is not a good film br br i can usually sit through a van damme movie if i have to as they are usually a bit of a laugh and don't require much thought this one has no redeeming features br br it has a distinct lack of plot humour acting direction etc etc a real stinker on all levels br br i have never walked out of a cinema during a movie although i came damme close here br br avoid at all costs
<START> i have just wasted my saturday night watching this crap i saw the names of chris noth mr big from sex the city robert patrick from x files the decadent elliot gould colm meaney and mercedes ruehl on the credit a very reasonable imdb rating 5 6 and many good reviews in imdb for my total surprise the film is horrible the characters are badly constructed the story tries to be funny but it is totally silly the character of mercedes ruehl is amazingly stupid for a professor of princeton so i decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews and i found that most of them are made by imdb users with only review therefore relatives or friends of the cast and crew or people hired to promote this garbage my vote is three br br title brazil without return
<START> the forgotten aka don't look in the basement is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror movie br br the story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited about br br the patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without laughing br br now the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesn't really deserve its place on the video nasties list br br overall if you aren't looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then it's worth a watch
<START> how could a film dealing with illegal mexican immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border be dull well border incident is br br no wonder that song and dance man george murphy's career ended not long after this terrible film came out politics was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies a horrible death in this slowly paced film the film stereotypes the typical mexican migrant farmer worker as dimwitted and awfully dull br br the film only picks up in intensity once the identities of murphy and ricardo montalban have been discovered as federal agents for the u s and mexico respectively br br disappointing at best we see similar problems in our very own society today
<START> business executive is kidnapped made to wander miles and miles in a woodland for days and days exchanging dialog with his kidnapper and we have got to listen to all the nonsense br br meanwhile his snotty wife and family are at home with the fbi wondering what to do at no time does she seem concerned about the fate of her husband except when it comes to the ransom a love story give me a break br br the plot is ludicrous and almost every scene is filled with an air of expectation that something significant is going to happen but it never does br br the result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid and it becomes even more silly when we learn the fate of the kidnapper br br this is garbage br br 2 out of 10
<START> the poet carne disappears didnÂ´t he disappeared with prÃ©vert and is followed by the judge carne the director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he doesnÂ´t understand and he doesnÂ´t want to itÂ´s a long way from the wonderful les enfants du paradis
<START> the good things first i agree with another viewer who said that gene raymond has a marvelous drunk scene he does i was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh and there were other moments i found amusing parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing and the scene in the restaurant with robert montgomery trying to make carole lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger br br but overall i was dismayed i love carol lombard and most of hitchcock and i understand the restrictions laid on productions by the hays code but this was embarrassing and awful to watch of course i knew they'd end up together this is a romantic comedy after all but it made no sense it happened too fast plus i can't believe the professions of love when confronted with such hurtful behavior both physical and confrontational
<START> this movie has been done when hitler and mussolini who is as well in the movie was at the top and many politics and even the roman church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of nazism especially in usa there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in germany and europe charles for example it would be as today a big actor would made a parody of berlusconi or chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and imho a great demonstration he was a courageous man the movie is funny and deep the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated i think this movie is one of the best ever done
