<START> i just watch this move recently on encore channel what a great film a great cast as well is very suspenseful and unpredictable the movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong upfront story involvement therefore nelson played by kiefer sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life then it's gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life then all of the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for randy played by platt then the story unfold into a resolution and basic understanding about life and the presence and meaning of god david played by kevin bacon an atheist end up questioning his own belief about god it's amazing to watch julia roberts along with kevin bacon oliver platt william baldwin and kiefer sutherland at such a prime time of their careers one can ask how come we don't have such great movie produced anymore this is one of the best productions from joel schumacher i really enjoy this movie
<START> i first saw death in venice 1971 about 15 years ago found it profoundly moving and often thought about it watching it again few days ago i realized that it is close to the top of the great works of cinema with hardly any dialog it captivates a viewer with the beautiful cinematography the fine acting and above all the music without which the movie simply could not exist br br death in venice is a stunning luchino visconti's adaptation of the thomas mann novella about a famous composer in the novella he was a writer but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably gustav von loosely based on gustav who travels to venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures his search for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty dirk bogard follows the boy everywhere never trying to approach him the boy belonged to very rare creatures that own an enigmatic and inconceivable power which captivates you enchants you conquers you and makes you its prisoner became one of the prisoners of spellbinding charms he became addicted to him he fell in love with him was it bless or curse for him i think both he died from unreachable impossible yet beautiful love which object was perfection itself the last image eyes captured was that of the boy's silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sun light nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and to take it with you to the grave is the death one can only dream about if he could probably would've said i was able to witness one of the faces of perfection i could not bear it but i was chosen to learn that it exists here in this world and i can die in peace now because it did happen to me br br unforgettable music gustav haunting of his fifth symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie it reflects every emotion of a main character it sobs it longs it begs for hope and it summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to encounter beauty you are condemned to die i may come up with hundreds movies that use classical music to perfection but nothing will ever compare to death in venice i dare say that music is its main character it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen it sounded triumphantly when returned back to venice to what he thought would be his happiness but turned to be his death it sounded gloomy when he first entered venice from the sea you can hear so many different feelings in it tenderness and adoration confusion and self loathing worship and melancholy but always love that gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts literally the movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the aging composer writer artist we are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty as much as was by the boy's mysterious charm
<START> why you ask does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the almighty well its deductive logic my friends you see i know god exists because satan does how else would my poor eyes have been soiled on such a horrendous film yes there is no doubt about it on a cold friday in the year 2006 satan possessed me and forced me to watch this film he what you wonder the devil makes little girls spit up vomit and climb ceilings why would he waste his time in making you watch this film my only conclusion to that query is that satan believes watching camp fear is the worst form of mortal punishment not gouging out your eyes or making you speak in tongues instead making you sit mindlessly through one and half hours of the most awful film making ever can this film be as terrible as he says yes my friend watching this film is the equivalent of getting kicked in the sack about fifty million times maybe more but maybe i am being too harsh this film does have a few moments in it the beginning for example starts in a sorority house with a lot of topless girls now never being in a sorority i am unsure if girls really do this but hey one can always pray now after the five minutes of boobs and butt cheeks has ended we are presented with a scene on campus at an all girls college the girls themselves about eight in all are in an archaeological class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds flash forward the professor of the class who happens to be the only male at this girls college apparently takes a handful of his nubile students plus girlfriend to a remote lake in the mountains their quests to find ancient indian artifacts yeah right professor we know what angle your pitching now this is where the movie gets going the group of five four girls one guy stops at a gas station to get some directions but lo and behold a biker gang pulls up and harasses the girls only to eventually leave them alone and go their separate ways moving on they get to a campsite consisting of four logs and some trees and then things start to go horribly wrong first the prof and his girlfriend go wandering away to have some alone time when one of the girls takes it upon herself to find them only to be captured by some unknown force continuing on the other two girls begin searching for the missing girl when the bikers plus one drunk guy come looking for them their plan to rape the girls and do horrible things to them the movie goes on with something about a druid needing four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from some kind of water monster before the year two thousand but their is a hitch to this plan mr druid one of the girls is right before us so away goes that plan now since i said there would be spoilers i'll go ahead and ruin the end of the movie for you the four girls get taken drugged with some green goo and then are ready to be sacrificed after one of them is killed the two remaining bikers and the prof come to save them they stand upon a ledge where the not lead biker says i think i can make it down there only to leap down and break his leg the prof runs at the guy and gets subdued only leaving the once rape minded now heroic biker left to fend off the giant druid first he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick then pulls a knife the knife reflects some lazer beam within a gold snakes mouth and lights the druid on fire instantaneously afterwords they carry the wounded away via emergency stick and ponder if everything is really over only to have the lake bubble showing the monster within it still lives in a nutshell that is the film and this is my review which unfortunately will go unread by most eyes since this is only the fifth posted review for a film that has been out for fifteen years thankfully satan can only get to some of us and not all the judge would like to make one heartfelt apology to the poor girl at circuit city i am going to let borrow this movie i'm sorry sheila please don't hate me for letting you watch this
<START> the governess was by far a very pitiful film i do not use this word loosely as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie i finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind Â why honestly you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit there were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development both in the story and in the characters which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation scenes would occur with no foreshadowing understanding or drive to a complete ending it was as if i was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved this was my biggest issue with this film the complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine ripple effect being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result br br let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film i would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it it made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all minnie driver was the worst culprit of this deed her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent she would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time she has her first moment of passion in this film and there is no pain or excitement it nonchalantly happens and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with rosina and her sister she is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention that was confusing and completely random is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non existent anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching daughter anything the sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between driver and jonathan rhys meyers nearly had me laughing out loud i thought maybe i had discovered some magic in this film as rhys meyers literally poofed into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama it felt that the director or writer was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts well it didn't fool me i saw that he was nearly a cut and paste character used to strengthen an already weakened story don't get me started on the ending which had no consistency to the rest of the story again using the cut and paste method the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story and this was the only solution they could arrive to it is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character Â but i guess that is the name of the game in hollywood fix until completely broken or at least salvageable br br the remainder of the story was unexciting dribble there were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent period piece music but nothing to write to grandma about more family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more but as i stated before by leaving open ended scenes just lying around the entire film you will experience a crack in your foundation what may seem like a sturdy story will eventually wear down over time and by the end of this film i felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me wilkinson plays his normal self in this film while driver apparently did not want to get naked but everyone else had too i will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes Â also she wore the same dress everyday that was disgusting and i could smell her through the television sex and dirty laundry now there is a great film for you there just seemed to be some potential floating around here but instead it was just rubbish nothing was answered questions seemed to fall like snow in alaska and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme br br overall this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together but instead it was just pitiful i cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre explanation i don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child but something should have been done to build a foundation just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that i used if you were as confused about that as i was then you will completely understand the film the governess while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal Â then maybe this film is for you br br grade out of
<START> two hours ago i was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes 2000 close ups it close ups of walls humans and of many other things the warm colored lighting which is also usually by the director gave the movie a warm atmosphere only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie silence and slow movements characterize the movie some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close ups not only tony leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant i wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the 1960s this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end in short i would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema
<START> obviously inspired by se7en and sometimes even more gruesome more bloodshed and very graphic details a bit too much for my taste great script and acting i was especially impressed by ken and there were no weak points in te cast good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound one of the best thrillers i've seen since years although it was scheduled on bbc in three parts i watched messiah on video in one take one point of critic the motivation of the villain was not very convincing
<START> phoned work sick watched this in bed and it was so awful i would have went back to work if i could have gotten out of bed the dog ran off with the remote so i was stuck br br i'm positive hammer was grooming the eldest daughter to become his br br horrendous to watch made me vomit more than what i was doing anyway so there you have it this would be the film that they play in the waiting room of hell before you go in or maybe your stuck in the film for all eternity with the hart kids just remember to take a gun with you
<START> this movie is so unreal french movies like these are just waste of time why watch this movie even i did not know why what the well known sex scene of half siblings although the sex scene is so real and explicit but the story it is based upon is so unreal what is the use of it then can you find easily in life half sibling doing such things br br did i learn something from this movie yeah some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies such stories such non sense but for those who like nihilism nothingness in life or simply a life without hope then there you are you've got to see this movie br br only one worth adoring though catherine deneuve she's such a strikingly beautiful woman
<START> ascending to power in 1933 hitler and his national socialist german workers party which of course we all know as the nazis tightened their grip on the country more and more as the time went by early in their rough shod trampling of the german people they called any and all artists newspaper men and film makers into their nazi hq in order that the may be informed of just what the newly declared third reich aka expected of them br br when the master director from the german cinema's silent impressionist and expressionist era mr fritz lang was called in to meet with herr goebels he listened attentively and said nothing immediately after leaving the minister of office herr lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to paris not even going back to his residence fritz lang did not return to germany at least not until many years later he remained in france eventually immigrating to the united states of america br br mr lang went right to work in america creating a variety of most enjoyable solid and substantially literate upper echelon movies for many a year included in this smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of titles is today's lucky subject western union 20th century fox 1941 br br typically a film about the old west and pioneer days needed both quality as well as quantity of cast western union qualified on both requisites we are treated to a fine array of starring talent as well as a supporting cast which makes just about every minute and each scene a delight to our senses br br heading up the are robert young randolph scott dean jagger and virginia gilmore others prominently displayed are folks like john carradine playing not a vampire or other scary guy but a physician george slim summerville veteran character actor silent film veteran and graduate of mack sennett's keystone comedies chill wills always dependable supporting player and former singer in the avalon boys and burly bad guy barton added to this mix we have names like russell hicks victor killian minor watson george chandler addison richards irving bacon james flavin francis ford frank mcgrath and kermit maynard ken bro br br prominent in those american indians featured are chief big tree chief thundercloud and mr jay also featured is that one great representative of the aboriginal peoples of north america is that great singularly impressive and memorable example of the red man the louisiana native iron eyes cody born of sicilian immigrant parents br br the filming of the fine outdoor scenes was done on location in arizona and utah and rendered in the highest grade of available there is no monument valley but then that's the province of mr john ford in some respects this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think for it took a sort of pulp magazine story adapted it to the tastes and idioms of the pre war america of the late thirties and early forties all of this being done by a german born director who was only had been in hollywood and america for the shortest length of time br br in its final analysis western union while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the western genre we just don't care it scores in all of the necessary categories needed for a great night at the movies so who really cares about little details such as accuracy br br we give mr lang and 20th century fox a rating of br br note we just saw a special on pbs station here in chicago that was all about all of the film actors directors and other artisans whom the nazi rise to power caused to take refuge in america and hollywood it seems that movie folks and scientists were the biggest export for germany at this particular time being that the scientists who built the atomic bomb as well as the future nasa people came from europe at this time br br poodle schnitz
<START> i watched this basically for the sole reason that it was supposed to have third reich references in it it turned out a pretty brainless and predictable slasher film that appeared to be made to appeal to feminists or something br br let me tell you something if you wait an entire movie to see the attractive female lead's breasts the last thing you want is a tastefully done sex scene with annoying camera angles that don't show anything her busty friend didn't get hers out either but we saw plenty of men's butts and pubic hair and guys with their shirts off and at the end you have our heroine magically dodging the scalpel thrusts and swings of the villain who turns out to be the hunk funnily enough and she easily out fights him uh huh while her male love interest is tied down and waiting to be rescued the funniest part was when she picks up a chair and swings it at the guy and it breaks over him now it'd be about as much as she could manage to lift the chair let alone smash it against a person with enough force to break it it looks ridiculous she basically brushes it against him and it falls apart if you are going to do this sort of role reversal rubbish which has already been done to death then you have to at least make it semi plausible br br there was one good bit though the bad guy did get the better of her slutty friend teaching her a lesson for being such a tramp and sleeping around that's not exactly something feminists would like br br pretty stupid really not that american slasher flicks are generally much better but you have to wonder why they bothered it brought nothing new to the genre at all br br 5 10
<START> you've seen the same tired worn out clichÃ©d sit com stories characters stories 1000's of times this excels at sucking more than others first and foremost there isn't a single character in this show that's even remotely likable in particular michael dave gold is by far one of the biggest asses ever to grace a television screen ever repugnant comes to mind if in real life a father was this unlikable cruel and just generally unfit to parent would be your only option to call the remaining characters stereotypes would be too complementary if these characters ended up on life support the line to pull the plug would be light years long how this show finished one complete season much less 2 is a mystery fox cancels arrested development and keeps this on the air you tell me the terrorists aren't winning
<START> how to qualify this film simply horrible it is badly done with poor dialogues reeves played as bad as ever and cameron diaz competed with him do not waste your time watching such a film although a big waste of money has already occurred to make the film
<START> too much added with too much taken away from a great western that was written by about the texas rangers vs the indian this screenplay takes that away only to fill this mini series with a lot of warm fuzzy relationships that in truth were secondary to the main storyline it ends with a totally unbelievable and detached ending not written in the book that makes you question how we are to be transported to lonesome dove br br the series main characters were in truth cast very well the filming locations were excellent but this mini series should have stayed true to what is a great book
<START> this is the worst movie i've ever seen and it takes the price of the rotten movie of 2007 which is made by me anyway this movie misses every single ingredients of a good movie i mean come on the actors had a bad performance the story is just crap i'm really really disappointed they could have done better stuff than this piece of junk i've just wasted my time and my money on this movie i wish that the production company could give back my money anyhow i'd high expectations on this movie and i've got disappointed i don't recommend anybody to watch this so if u wanna waste ur money on something do it on some thing else than this piece of junk
<START> no hitch is decidedly not a romantic comedy about bilious and former leftist pundit turned reactionary pundit christopher hitchens though it sure would've made for a funnier movie a dumpy little englishman teeth stained black from cigarettes and guinness barking out advice and acerbic political commentary to lovelorn men look into her eyes when you speak to her you nutter and remember calling someone a 'neo makes you a de facto anti semite can't you get anything straight you liberal br br oh well instead we get will smith whose continuing success remains a mystery to me at least i am apparently alone in this regard smith is the most powerful man in hollywood as of this writing americans just can't help throwing their money at him i on the other hand find his smugness insufferable unmitigated by a scene here spoiled by the trailer where he suffers a drastic allergic reaction to seafood we know smith will bounce back to his bland over muscled good looks because there's a fat sit com actor kevin james on hand making a fool of himself we're supposed to laugh hysterically whenever the slob starts dancing like a jackass cue everybody dance now by cc music factory but why would a straight arrow accountant behave in such a way i've worked with several straight arrow accountants for years and i can tell you that if in norman memorable phrase tough guys don't dance neither do straight arrow accountants am i taking all this too seriously or and here's a daring thought perhaps the writers couldn't conceive a logically drawn character to save their lives br br speaking of the writers they come up with a lousy idea for smith's love interest a writer for a tabloid eva mendes since when do tabloid creeps deserve love what universe am i in anyway everyone here at imdb is actually gushing over this tripe either you all need to raise the bar in terms of entertainment value for your buck or i'm just a skunk at the garden party me and about 150 million other long suffering boyfriends and husbands in any case if i may imitate smith's hitch and offer my male readers some smooth advice when you're dragged to see hitch say to your better half hey that was pretty good after the movie is over don't be overenthusiastic don't rave about it she'll know you're lying to her praise it in a lightly surprised way as if the movie was better than you expected and wasn't the agonizing time waster that it actually was but what am i saying eh fellas we dudes know all the moves br br 1 star out of 10
