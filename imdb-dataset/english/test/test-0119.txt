<START> in the changing world of cg and what not of cartoon animations etc etc was a warm welcome at least by me i think it's important to show these sort of films once in a while to preserve them and help remind us of where the originality and fun of cartoons actually came from people were talking about how it is boring because of the graphics and stuff but hey think about the films that will be considered boring if every film looked like the new state of the art ones everybody and their mother is making these days call me old fashioned but i liked it it's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings and all it really needs from its audience is their imagination
<START> hi i'm sheena an african yet white jungle tribal princess who possesses the incredible ability to transform into the cheapest monster in the world think 60s star trek aliens by rolling seductively in mud when i first found myself in this horrible position i took the only logical action i made myself a torn apart jungle bikini in which to perform my badly acted antics i enjoy romance novels and tearing apart the occasional unimpressive african warlord and i would be remiss if i did not mention my white of course sidekick mr cutter an american ex military man who seems to have fled the u s after his divorce can you say ducking alimony anyway he provides the occasional distraction from my difficult life i mean how many idiot blonds do you know who are also an endangered species of flesh rending monster despite my many hardships acting is so hard whine i haven't given up and after much soul searching i have finally discovered my role in life to terrorize late night television viewers who are so unfortunate as to not have cable or satellite
<START> the simpsons of course started off with christmas special simpson's roasting on an open fire which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better this episode centers around bart who in this episode swaps on a test from martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted this leading to bart his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates the episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the character's exactly as they became 20 years later so watch this episode in a pack of season 1 and enjoy early simpson's doing what it was meant to making people laugh i rate this episode 73
<START> not even original in the plot ho hum there were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting but the film follows the path of 90 of hollywood movies i don't really get samuel jackson's acting most of the time in his other films but he was rather good in this film he rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an in your face anger i liked eva mendes as usual and even though she is great eye candy she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress luis guzman was actually really good also except that i disliked the change of his character towards samuel jackson at the end of the film how can one's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second is there no original thought left in hollywood
<START> written by directed by and starring the champ of camp bruce campbell easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair filmed independently in bulgaria all i can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny campbell plays an affluent american business man with a cheating wife antoinette byron and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered he hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town not knowing that his wife is on' with the taxi driver within moments of campbell being bludgeoned the cabbie is killed in the same location a mad scientist stacy keach proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie's brain inside the american's head with massive stitches on his forehead campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over sized head campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself thus bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased i get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy rounding out the cast are ted raimi tamara and watch for this on the sci fi channel
<START> after a good start it turned out to be the worst piece of holier than thou propaganda i've ever seen this movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the holy bible br br to resume the ok let's call it a plot basically alien don't abduct people that we already know no in fact its demonic forces abducting people which are in new age stuff or witchcraft or read porno magazine as one protagonist does br br it's complete with the little emotional piano music when the lead character realize he must blindly follow christ to be saved br br a quote sums it all imagine a subtle piano music in the background you can't let others even those you love stop you from following the lord br br and we are supposed to live in an enlightened age still work to do boycott this piece of crap
<START> if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of che guevara the cuban revolutionary who helped aid fidel castro in his bid for power you'd better read up on cuban history or even type in his name on a search engine you are on the internet after all br br but whatever you do do not watch che br br unless of course you just want a good laugh br br all the reviewers of the time and moviegoers gave che their vote for worst film of the decade and no wonder have you seen this travesty its facts are tenuous at best sharif is even unconvincing as a corpse and as for palance's fidel imitation br br like i said if you want a good laugh br br it's like watching a co production between the learning channel and mad magazine br br one star br br i wonder if palance can do w c fields too
<START> this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything
<START> this is just what we need a show about the people nobody likes in high school or in university man or woman people others and congratulating themselves for doing so is exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking and this show is just disgusting for doing exactly that br br so four men sit in chairs and watch two other guys try and pick up women to have sex with them and in the end one of the two wins great just f n great i'm also supposed to accept these four douche bags as being judges of people's game the term game has got to be the most moronic thing to come out of modern english since the term bling bling added to the fact that these men are called the experts just makes me want to throw up whats left of my respect for modern culture these are not god damn role models they are the result of mtv culture coming to bite us in the ass if you enjoy the bullshit spilling out the sides of this monstrosity then you probably think paris hilton and spears have talent its not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking so br br and for all those people who will say that i would like this better if i got laid or that i'm just jealous go screw yourself because its obvious that a real girl certainly won't
<START> ok yes i know i'm a philistine and i have no knowledge of nor love for opera i readily admit that i might feel differently about this film if i did but i don't so for those of you like me skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty sometimes unclothed girls for what it's worth i thought the first segment with theresa russell who i didn't recognize was the best of the lot
<START> everyone who has ever wondered how to make a film on no budget should see this documentary the determination of everybody portrayed in this project was very moving to me and should connect to those of us who have ever ventured into any part of show business be it film music or writing i think the film makers could have done a better job with foreshadowing the events that led up to this film becoming a documentary perhaps by use of a narrator other than that the film comes off as a real example of how show business isn't about the show but rather the business br br i hope that the actual intended project repo man ii gets to see the light of day i think the film makers did a fine job on it with what little they had to work with and all that they had to overcome to complete it
<START> this is an excellent documentary about a story i hadn't heard about before the first solo non stop sailing race around the world took place in 1968 69 and involved a handful of racers it's a truly fascinating story about man vs nature and man vs himself the story focuses on donald the tragic figure in this story the film elegantly combines interviews with footage which was shot by the sailors themselves aboard their boats the story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details behind the history of donald this is one of the best documentaries of the past few years it has true human emotion in it as the men face this almost impossible task of navigating the world non stop on their own
<START> after repeatedly saying how brilliant so many columbo episodes are it's time to honour an episode with maximum points etude in black is not 100 percent perfect but it's certainly more than 90 percent maybe 96 or 97 br br last week i reviewed just married and compared it unfavourably to meet the parents well here's one of the parents blythe danner in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor alex benedict played by the legend that is john cassavetes alex has been having an affair with jennifer wells a girl in the orchestra not his first affair one suspects she is blackmailing alex to leave his wife but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra alex doesn't think it'd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide br br enter columbo and guess what it takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide it doesn't take much longer for columbo to connect alex to the victim and soon he's following him around wherever he goes even though columbo is certain alex is his man it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads none of which columbo really swallows before he has the vital piece of evidence br br along the way there are some top notch extra characters ranging from the precocious young neighbour of jennifer wells and the english mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on coronation street through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder he had also been seeing jennifer wells the busy girl and there's even a brief cameo from commandant from the police academy films as with leslie nielsen in lady in waiting it's impossible to take him seriously i bet you're thinking of that speech he made at the podium aren't you br br but it's blythe danner john cassavetes and peter falk who steal the show here blythe is absolutely divine as mrs benedict from the moment she spots alex jennifer wells' number from memory she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was it's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust alex despite her intuition telling her something is very very wrong columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her questions about alex's relations with members of his orchestra br br as for john cassavetes well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as columbo villains because he could have been up there with jack cassidy and patrick mcgoohan as one of the all time greats of the show but this performance is superb he's another one who falls into the highly irritated category losing all patience with columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him despite this when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge columbo's genius br br well it's a really really fantastic show it loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music as highlighted by many of the posters here but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations and at least the music is good dramatic and exciting br br finally if you haven't come across it there is an absolutely amazing clip of john cassavetes and peter falk on the dick cavett show from the early 70s i'm totally convinced steve coogan watched this clip and based alan partridge on it everything about the clip resembles knowing me knowing you from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of cavett by his guests even the orchestra get in on the act playing circus music while falk cassavetes and their friend ben gazzara fool about and ridicule the host br br it might not be strictly relevant to this review but the cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between peter falk and john cassavetes it's clear to see from the quality of etude in black just how well the pair worked together
<START> ring ring have been horror directors hotline how may we help you i mean hello my name is err call me by my initials r d okay mr r d what seems to be the problem well the reviews on my latest movie dial help were all negative and harsh and frankly i myself feel like my career has seen better days as well okay mr r d and why do you suppose that is well i gained fame and a well deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and another one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park for which i borrowed the idea from wes craven but dial help revolves on Â never mind no no mr r d go ahead and tell me what the film is about um it's about a spiritually possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her ah i see that premise does indeed sound a little silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists but i suppose there are deeper themes in your film right oh yeah um what do you mean by that well isn't the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror or perhaps it's all just happening in the mind of your female heroine um it's just about a phone going berserk and murdering people with the cord vibrations electricity or even ordinary coins interesting mr r d but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie you see i figured the slowly unraveling phone mystery plot wouldn't be that important or relevant so i just concentrated on processing all possible phone gimmicks i could think of phone gimmicks what do you mean you know like wind blowing through the horn mind penetrating dial tones and turn tables catapulting into the air very original mr r d but not exactly horrific and as an experienced director you must know that in the end people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events oh but there is it all has to do with negative and unreleased energy if i remember correctly it's all a bit fuzzy i admit hmmÂ i see oh well as they always say a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story did you at least process some of your regular trademarks into the film so that your fans at least recognize your style i tried lord knows i tried but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking anyone that's a pity indeed mr r d but what about sex everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril yes but Â but what mr r d well to tell you the truth we kind of promoted dial help as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of charlotte lewis on the cover but in reality there's no sex in the film and charlotte even refused to go topless mr r d now i'm really disappointed that's just shamelessly ripping people off and lure them with false promises i know i know and i'm ashamed but i just wanted everybody to rent dial help and love it well to round up i can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few erroneous decisions without it affecting his her career immediately but be more cautious next time and do some research first okay mr r d i will thank you you're welcome tell me have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already yeah as a matter a fact i do i was thinking about making a giallo with a murderous washing machine doesn't that sound fascinating hello hello
