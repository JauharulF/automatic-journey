<START> i won't lie i rented this film because it was an arty film with some possible explicit sex i got that scene and catherine deneuve's briefly shown breasts but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like did i have a mother or father i don't know paraphrased usually delivered in long soliloquies br br if you are curious about the transition of art to porn might be an interesting look with use of the fast forward button i was still too slow

<START> this movie doesn't have any pretense at being great art which is good but it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting i think if i wrote it i could do without the drama surrounding the wife but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning minnie driver's character i think that all too often hollywood abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama when with an adult themed movie such as this the emotional type of drama is all that's really needed and probably more believable too overall it's a very well done offering and well worth seeing
<START> not since bette davis's 1933 vehicle ex lady have i seen a film that was so much better than its star said it was most of the bum rap atoll k a k a utopia a k a robinson a k a escapade has got over the years has come from the horror stories stan laurel told of its production given that he suffered a stroke during filming looked like death warmed over through much of it from the opening two shot of them together you'd never guess that laurel survived hardy by eight years and was subsequently diagnosed with diabetes once he adjusted his diet accordingly he restored himself to health one can understand why laurel didn't think this film was the most pleasant experience of his life yes it's flawed the cheapness of the production shows through the dubbing is awful and laurel and hardy were too old to do the energetic slapstick of their greatest films but it's still genuinely funny and lÃ©o story introduces elements of political satire sometimes libertarian sometimes one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians like chaplin or the marx brothers but never from laurel and hardy the film deserves credit for being different though its debt to the ealing studios' classic passport to pimlico made just a year earlier is pretty obvious and for integrating the laurel and hardy comedy into a rather edgy context completely different from anything they'd used before this isn't a great movie but it's certainly better than the eight dreary ones for fox and mgm they'd made in the early 1940's i suspect only the film's technical crudity kept it from earning the cult following among anti establishment baby boomer youth the marx brothers' duck soup acquired in the late 1960's early 1970's
<START> tracy and matt michelle and sebastian these are the two couples whose lives of addiction crime and squalor are brilliantly captured in this raw and honest hbo documentary they're in turns petulant charming repulsive astonishingly stupid and dedicated to the drugs and to each other they're also each very different matt is a working class boy who clearly revels in his naughtiness whilst prep school dropout tracy supports the couple with western union money from her father who makes a surprisingly sympathetic cameo towards the end of the film meanwhile widow michelle whose hubby died of an od earns her daily bread by posing as an nypd vice cop willing to cut her would be johns a deal to avoid prison time and sad sack companion sebastian lives off the proceeds you'll be pulled into their stories and will wish the film went on for twice as long unlike most documentaries of this kind there's no coda providing us with an update about their progress can matt and tracy really keep that brooklyn apartment will michelle go back to bellevue for more detox and can sebastian become any more pathetic as a result the film seems incomplete but that may have been the point essential viewing as long as you aren't completely averse to scenes of people shooting up
<START> like a great many twilight zone episodes one of my favorite parts of this one was the overt social commentary that serling is making with the story as was the case with a recent episode the howling man i was reminded of my long standing suspicion that for example if jesus were to come to earth to bring his followers to heaven he would be immediately judged insane and probably thrown into an asylum our main character in this episode meets a similar problem when trying to convince the 1860s americans that he is from the future and the president lincoln is about to be assassinated the episode wrongly asserts that this means that some parts of the past can be changed while others can't but it's a fun time travelling romp nonetheless br br granted we don't know for a fact whether history could be changed by time travel because time travel has never been accomplished and sadly never will be but it seems logical to me that if you could physically place yourself in a time of the past you could physically prevent something from happening as long as you didn't flail around like a lunatic yelling about assassinations br br one of the consistently interesting things about time travel films and tv shows in my opinion is the method by which the time travel takes place there is really no method at all here our main character is having a conversation about time travel at a posh gentlemen's club and then walks outside and into a dissolve from the early 1960s to the mid 1860s but no matter the twilight zone has thus far not struck me for its complex sets or high production values br br russell johnson plays the part of peter corrigan the time traveller and upon discovering that he has been somehow transported back to the exact day of lincoln's assassination he manages to get himself thrown in prison but luckily for him john wilkes booth for some reason just happened to be hanging out at the police station and overheard the frantic corrigan desperately trying to describe the very assassination that booth was planning for that night br br booth requests custody of corrigan for some psychiatric experimentation and the police officer sees nothing wrong with relinquishing custody to this guy he had a business card after all how bad could he be br br the show seems to suggest that you can change people's lives by slightly altering events in the past through time travel and while i'm not willing to accept that time travel would include such limitations it's still a fun episode that really makes you think which is one of my favorite qualities of the good twilight zone shows
<START> what are the movies i mean what are movies made for shootings killings no they are made for life stories and this is what this movie does it presents how the life has changed between two ages the father and a son the father being in a need of a job and asking the son for help br br although there is another generation there are some characteristics which remain including the caress for the family br br the main subject is in my opinion the love of the son to the father and vice versa br br the movie is consisted of only one dialog but that dialog is more than i could ever wanted this movie is a pure art once again after si delivers us another beautiful movie well done
<START> this film was strongly recommended by a friend and being a great fan of brando i ordered this film from harrods and eagerly waited for it to arrive i have seldom been so disappointed by a film brando was good as a german officer but the rest of the film was simply unbearable you never get to like or care for any of the characters except brando maybe the acting was ok story what story maybe that's the point it's war after all but i've seen far better war films lawrence of arabia apocalypse now even star wars it was so boring i kept checking my watch br br overall this is one of the worst films i have seen please don't waste your time and money on this may i also add that this is the first user comment i have written i just had to let my feelings about this film known br br by the way my all time favourites are casablanca the godfather 1 2 one flew over the cuckoo's nest pulp fiction and amadeus if you haven't seen them yet please spare the time to do so and amadeus must be in widescreen 2 35 1
<START> where to begin i like the scary snow monster named jack frost the whole concept works well for me we thought he'd be back and he was changing the local to a tropical resort works seeing old friends and meeting new characters scott macdonald does a great job as jack frost you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance yup jack frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first i do have one complaint the little jacks or the as i call them they looked like hand puppets i think they could have done a better job with the the mouth could have opened wider but the cgi was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again if you liked jack frost then you will like this sequel no questions or debate 9 big stars
<START> i saw this last week during bruce campbell's book tour i thought it was amazing almost everything i would expect from a bruce campbell sci fi movie its campy and very funny ted raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy the plot is wacky an american business man goes to bulgaria and is killed stacy keach plays a mad scientist who saves brings bruce campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex kgb turned cabbie bruce campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the kgb agent the movie has all the great bruce campbell slap stick and humor the movie is somewhat predictable i knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer however i didn't go to see this movie because i thought it would have an oscar winning script i went to see it because it was a bruce campbell sci fi movie and i was not disappointed in the least i highly recommend that you go see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the sci fi channel next month although before the movie he said the sci fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it tv friendly if you are a fan of bruce i highly recommend it
<START> thursday june 9 6 broadway performance hall saturday june 11 1 broadway performance hall br br bless the independent filmmaker without them we'd see nothing but spielberg the farrelly brothers and films based on old sitcoms they are the risk takers they reap the rewards of success and suffer the failures max and grace is most definitely a failure credit is deserved by michael for getting out there and making his first feature which he claims drove him to bankruptcy he might be better off sticking to the stage if this film is any indication of what to expect in the future even though everyone warned me i went to see max and grace anyway hoping i might discover something they did not it starts off well enough a party for max in his parent's house shot in warm subdued light the camera floating into interesting angles as soon as we see max has hung himself an obvious rip off of harold and maude the whole thing goes right in the tank how could he do this unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party for that matter how could two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to get married and do it with the blessings of all parties concerned in the q a after the film david suggested the entire story was the surrealist dream of his character max this story is so badly written the comment sounded more like an excuse the film doesn't look as though it was made on a shoestring all the more reason to be so disappointed with the results what's intended as funny isn't but instead is offensively bad the continuity is sloppy the lighting is dreadful and the effects look cheap and forced seats under three hundred and was surprisingly full but i saw at least thirty or forty within the first half hour at one point grace played by natasha laments her inability to die i found myself thinking the same thing since i never walk out before the credits if really thinks this is one of the best scripts he has ever read it sounds like he needs to catch up on his reading a terrible waste of talent and resources this is the worst independent i've seen since bubba ho tep
<START> the original australian kim is brilliant why do american producers need to remake ruin yet another classic show remember the original version of the office with ricky gervais it was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to remake it the producers said that the british humour from the office and the australian humour from kim would not translate to an american audience what so basically they are saying that americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes so they need to remake the shows with over the top childish gags so that the americans can understand the humour the original australian version of kim is fantastic and very funny avoid the american version like the plague
<START> in 1982 two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens steven spielberg's et and john carpenter's the thing of the two of them et was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though the thing debuted first because people were so entranced with spielberg's warm fuzzy feelgood alien fable they stayed away from the thing in droves br br its not hard to see why the two are diametrically opposed one is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still beating heart the other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us i guess audiences felt et was a much cuter prospect than the thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva br br it's taken some time but the thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience as it should because the thing is that rare example of a superior remake it takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways indeed carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's alien and that's even rarer br br carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than the thing from another world did it keeps the frigid wastes of antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation but although a bit thin on characterisation the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them br br frequent carpenter collaborator kurt russell returns hot off the success of escape from new york cast once again as one of carpenter's perpetual anti heroes he plays macready the helicopter pilot at an antarctic research station what they're researching is anyone's guess the trouble begins when a norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over macready's trying to gun down a siberian husky from the air br br they end up dying for their troubles and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened they take in the husky and add it to their own except that this husky is not a husky at all but a shape changing alien the norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they it out it massacred their crew capable of absorbing its victims at will it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12 man crew until no one is certain who is human and who is not br br the thing is one of john carpenter's finest films in fact i'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made even surpassing classics like halloween and dark star the reason why i place the thing at the top of carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic all the others thereafter have felt like carpenter was slumming it films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works br br but the thing had john carpenter at the peak of his powers never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree not even in the ferocious assault on precinct 13 from the second the alien makes its presence known carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly and when he delivers his punches they come with an agonising jolt br br the film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror an approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in carpenter's hands melds together beautifully bringing in rob bottin of the howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film amorphous shapes half formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws spider legs and fully flexible tentacles indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm inducing the thing came under fire for being too realistic br br that type of thinking misses the point entirely it only shortchanges the film's values and there are many carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows whispers and implications characterisation has never been one of john carpenter's strong suits but it works to his advantage in the thing because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the present situation that much more confusing we're never certain from one moment to the next who is who and because of this the thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings br br a special mention should go to the excellent film score from ennio morricone a pulsing thud thud every two seconds it creates an eerie spooky feeling that is very hard to shake the whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation the scene where they blood test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising br br the thing is a pure unadulterated classic even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved an underrated film well worth the it received and so much better than et
<START> i also made the mistake of thinking that i was going to see the 2003 swimming upstream with rush this was worse then a lot of student films that i have seen the script was forced the acting was subpar and the editing annoying it was so slow that i just managed to force myself into staying but i always give a movie a chance so i suffered until the very end apparently there was a memo out about this movie because my friend and i were the only ones in the theater why didn't somebody send me this memo that is why i'm posting as a warning to others thinking of shelling out good money to see this i just hope that you actually got to this page and didn't get trapped like i did by looking at the wrong swimming upstream p s sorry to the cast and crew if you are reading this i know that you worked hard to make this i know what goes into making a movie keep trying
<START> i saw this film when it premiered in la i think i laughed 2 or three times the rest of the time i was in shock at how ridiculous poorly shot and poorly written it was kirby is in fact the only saving grace in the film i was disappointed at the performance of larry whom i usually find entertaining if you enjoy watching your friend's crappy homemade short films that they shot on their mom's 8mm video camera then there's a slight chance you might enjoy this film then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that it's your buddies playing all the parts you don't know these people so you'll probably find it as dull and stupid as i did dear mr nelson go back to film school intern for a while as a pa or a grip or some low level job so you can see how things are properly done in film then look for as long as you must to find a director of photography who knows what f stop means make sure he has nd filter on hand then try again repeat as many times as needed
