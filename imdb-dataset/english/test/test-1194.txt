<START> when we are young we all pick out an ideal occupation for ourselves artist actor writer rocket scientist etc while most of us grow out of our pipe dreams the main character of american movie mark has yet to let go of his and at a thirty something age too to become a wealthy acclaimed director despite the fact that murphy's law won't leave mark alone and something always seems to go wrong mark is able to persevere during each incident with an even greater drive to reach his goals his desire to be a director so controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to reach the goal while i noticed other imdb commenters are lambasting mark's selfishness i think it's an almost justified sort of selfishness because for mark not becoming a famous director is equivalent to death he talks incessantly about leaving some kind of mark on the world and he sees filmmaking as a way to do this br br unfortunately any viewer of this movie picks up early on the fact that mark has a near zero chance of ever achieving his dream is he aware of this no not in the slightest and none of his family or friends want to let him in on the secret in fact even some of them believe in him strangely enough though the disappointing future the viewer feels is sure to occur for mark doesn't impede the ability to find humor in the film this is a very very funny documentary most of the laughs come from when mark is filming scenes for coven there's a scene where an actor has to have his head break a cupboard and it's just not working another scene has mark's very old uncle bill saying a few lines to the camera needless to say after 20 takes of a lot of and line stumbling bill finally decides he's had enough a lot of humor sadly comes from mark himself his screenwriting which he seems to think is worthy of a pulitzer is laughingly bad it's alright it's ok there is something to live for jesus told me so br br american movie is contrary to what people might think a documentary that anyone can enjoy even though my sister who watched some scenes seemed to think it was downright bizarre the fact that chris smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both sadness from mark's depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with bill who unfortunately passed away before the film was released says quite a lot about him i wonder how the dreamer mark regards this documentary does he realize that it casts him in a bad light or that it sets up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film or does he see it as something that will be shown prior to his own a e biography segment it's an intriguing subject of wonder and i hope the latter comes true for him some day br br i highly recommend this movie 9 10
<START> at cheerleading camp the goody goody two shows lucky ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the 'tough' bad girl cheerleading team of the demons to beat the dastardly falcon team who always seems to win at this camp i guess this being a typical clichÃ©d '80's teen lame sex comedy who do you think will win but what the film lacks in originality it more than makes up for it sheer bloody awfulness oh and insanely bad dance numbers and the obligatory japenese businessmen who want to buy the camp on the condition that male cheerleader tommy hamilton stays with the camp of course simply awful forgettable and sadly has a surprising lack of nudity br br where i saw it hbo comedy br br my grade f yup i did indeed give it to them
<START> as several posters have hinted this is a sorry star wars ripoff now if you're going to rip off star wars at least do it right battlestar galactica did and there were a few other space operas that didn't do a bad job of it but this is definitely not one of them david mendenhall the juvenile lead actually isn't too bad though he goes overboard on the cute factor every so often vince edwards hasn't improved much as an actor since his ben casey days if anything he's even more wooden than he was ten the other performances are nothing to write home about either even worse are the special effects the best you can say about them is that they're lousy it's glaringly obvious that the aliens are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little foam or latex slopped on them and the battle scenes between edwards' raiders and the aliens are poorly staged and badly shot a very weak effort from roger corman skip it
<START> i just have to comment on this movie because i gave it a 4 rating and in my opinion that's pretty high for a softporn smut movie the actual plot is kind of hokey who would expect otherwise but is so incredibly funny and he delivers everything in a voice so it's easy for him whoever wrote the script had some wit definitely i must have laughed out loud ten times and that's not a reason anyone would pick up this movie the only softporn movie i've seen which had any merit other than beautiful women and believe me emmanuelle is drop dead gorgeous just look at the cover br br any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is also considering the movie wasn't made to artistically entertain so to speak it gets at least a four in my book i mean who wouldn't watch this before stop or my mom will shoot
<START> this is awesome there is no partnership quite like errol and olivia there love is genuine i'm 24 yet this flick is as captivating now as i'm sure it was 60 years ago raoul walsh is an under rated genius his direction is so sweeping so broad yet so intimate the last scene between colonel custer flynn and his wife de havilland almost brought me to tears not easy for a old guy its so heart wrenching there is also a deep christian message implicit here the faith custer has in taking your glory with you and the trust and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go in order that he his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this a must see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in american and military history from the inside patriotic for all the right reasons i knew errol flynn was a star and de havilland was a screen legend this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest
<START> excellent story with acting by all of the cast the warmth and insight into who represents moved off of the screen and into the heart of this viewer the and tenacity of mother in her quest to do his work till her last breath was also done with excellance by barbara hershey the intertwining of the personalities of and mother grew throughout the story line with a breath taking crescendo in the final scene
<START> if you value your freedom br br i first got seriously interested in the branch debacle after reading an article in uk journal the times wanting to learn more i rented this documentary and after watching it i was stunned at what i saw this film peaked my interest in the subject and i have read several books on the subject since then this film is a must see for people who only know the facts as reported in the so called mainstream media the lies double talk and contradictory statements made by officials and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice about calling people who question the governments actions in this fiasco nuts loonies and kooks br br whats scary is that i know some people who consider themselves open minded intellectuals and freedom loving liberals who are still convinced that the government did the right thing at waco and refuse to watch this film or read any of the books on the subject they continue to insist its not worth their time because its all propaganda from gun loving clinton hating religious fanatic right wing anarchist nuts one publication from an organization comprised of many so called great minds that claims to be dedicated to promoting reason common sense and rationalism condemned the film claiming it would poison peoples minds and strongly suggested this film should be suppressed they even hinted the davidians had it coming i won't mention its name since i'm a coward if you are one of those reading this of course you probably would not be reading this anyway i can only say its a shame you won't open your mind
<START> i was expecting this to be just like the others tries to be scary ends up looking silly somewhere along the line the writers must have realised this and so took the film in a totally different direction basically ignoring the other films this feels like a different film rather than the fourth entry in the child's play series the new idea works making this the best in the series by far
<START> the beautifully engaging song with the same name as the film won the best song oscar in 1955 br br love is a many thing br br it's the april rose that only grows in the early spring br br love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living br br that golden crown that makes a man a king br br once on a high and windy hill br br in the morning mist two lovers kissed and the world stood still br br then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing br br yes true love a many thing br br how can we forget such a beautiful song henry king the director had the privilege to work with jennifer jones twice that year for this film and the greatly under rated film good morning miss dove jones was nominated for thing but she could have been easily nominated for miss dove as well br br william holden is just great as the war correspondent sent to report on the communist revolution in 1949 china his love for jones an oriental doctor was endearing and so memorable to watch br br while the ending is not pleasing this is still one of the greatest romances ever put on the screen
<START> i am usually a big fan of pacino scarface serpico devils advocate but since scent of a woman he pretty much plays the same role and shouts a lot this movie had no endearing characters to warm to brandon played by bongo is the least likable of the bunch he nowhere even approached a real human being pacino was hopelessly unlikeable and my goodness how old is renee russo the only high light of this wretched mess was the hot hooker with the perfect lipstick and she has like 10 lines total even the usually reliable jeremy piven was utterly unlikeable br br note to writers of movies they do not usually work unless one of the main characters is at least a bit likable exception scarface as the movie closes and old brandon is at the airport my only thought was please let a plane crash into the airport and kill brandon
<START> peter falk shines as 90 year old morris the patriarch who has decided it's time to check out after holding a final blow out bash his three children san giacomo david paymer and judge reinhold are notified invited by letter and immediately arrive on his doorstep to deal with their eccentric father there is a great father daughter chemistry with laura san giacomo whose character happens to undergo the most growth from the ordeal it's a well rounded example of your average dysfunctional family and their memories pains growth and ignorance tolerance of each others' lives the musical score is one you'll enjoy and the one liners are well timed and hilarious although i found the actual checking out party a let down the rest of the film is sure to make you laugh cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face move over big fat greek wedding the big fat jewish suicide has arrived
<START> a precursor to citizen kane in its analysis of the life of a just deceased tycoon here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks in spencer tracy's 15th film he already looks middle aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be young br br a little silent screen type emoting is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable well written drama
<START> this sci fi great fortunately has little to do with the first one elias koteas jack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets naked billy drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget
<START> i played sam the porter lou's sidekick in the film dead rail which later aired as alien express and i have to say that for my part i thoroughly enjoyed watching this film as a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people it gave me great scenes to include on my reel and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half no waiting tables the director and steve and scott the producers were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production i made many friends lou todd steven and i consider myself very fortunate to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people there was not a day that went by that i did not laugh my butt off the real tragedy isn't so much the special effects it's that every single person who watched this film didn't get to see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that truly went into it craftsmen building the set prop masters gaffers wardrobe makeup artists script the cinematographer production assistants extras craft services producers director and actors it's a given that sci fi didn't spend a terrible amount of money on the film 2 million but there was a lot of time energy and man power that was instilled into it i look on the film now as a production that brought a lot of talented people together for a fun project that was shot without complications in less than two months it was a magnificent cast and crew and i'm just so glad to be apart of it on a further note to those of you who don't know lou diamond phillips todd bridges and steven brand they are fantastic people who are incredibly funny lou i still am working on my deniro impression and can't thank you enough for introducing me to midnight run todd every time i hear an elvis song i can't forget the story you told me about hanging out with him at his house for dinner can you please pass me the pa im a huge elvis fan steven mr brand you are a true gent and all the advice and encouragement i received from you will always be appreciated i miss you guys and hope you are well thanks for the good memories stories jokes and friendship oh and miss utah says hello wink wink br br joe
<START> after the success of star wars there was a boost in interest in sci fi movies this was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly br br a group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop motion dinosaurs where half of them are systematically killed off the people not the dinosaurs porn movie level acting cheap special effects even for the time although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them br br costumes were pure 1970's as were the hairstyles ahh the 70's i expected a disco to break out at any minute br br nothing to really recommend in this film
