<START> this show makes absolutely no sense every week two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening and every week without fail they somehow stumble upon a murder because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder right but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder wouldn't the smart thing to do be to tell the police you know the people who can actually do something about it but every week these two fools go around polluting evidence committing crimes of their own and in some cases causing more murders once they do miraculously solve the murders there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted all the evidence has been sabotaged and you'd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two wouldn't you yay we've solved the murder now like every other week let's go and confront the murderer ourselves and with no back up tell them that we know about it there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger is there rosemary and is one of the worst shows on television and certainly the most ridiculous
<START> i am the kind of person who can enjoy a good b movie if it has some kind of redeeming value to it but dead space has nothing to redeem it this is the kind of film that will make you frustrated restless and sick to your stomach br br bad acting lame story terrible effects horrible excruciating dialogue dead space has it all

<START> all the way though i was thinking to myself oh god why at the very beginning i thought right it might be average but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious br br every part in it was so predictable even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring it was a half decent movie but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves eg the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next and more times than less i was right br br why does going into the house make her come after you it doesn't make sense it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings and no really depth was seen at all br br you can see everything coming which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching oh shes behind her didn't see that one coming yawns br br surely these people must have thought to oh i don't know carry a knife round or at least try and fight back instead of being eaten but someone hair at best during the movie i was very mildly scared and i mean mildly i was just crying out for the credits as they rolled i exhaled a short oh thank god if you haven't already don't waste time and money on this pointless plot less sorry excuse for a sequel
<START> two hard luck but crafty ladies decide to act like havana widows by sailing to cuba to meet blackmail rich gentlemen br br this was the sort of ephemeral comic frippery which the studios produced quite effortlessly during the 1930's well made highly enjoyable depression audiences couldn't seem to get enough of these popular funny photo dramas br br joan blondell glenda farrell are perfectly cast as the frantic fast talking females who will go to great lengths to make a little dishonest dough although joan gets both top billing and the romantic scenes both gals are as talented watchable as they are gorgeous br br handsome lyle talbot plays joan's persistent suitor but he's given relatively little to do chubby cherubic guy kibbee appears as the girls' intended target whether awakening to find himself in the wrong bed or being chased across the roof of a cuban hacienda in his long johns he is equally hilarious behind him comes a rank of character actors allen jenkins frank mchugh ruth donnelly hobart cavanaugh maude eburne dewey robinson all equally adept at pleasing the toughest crowd br br movie mavens will recognize an uncredited james murray as the suspicious bank teller with the forged check this very talented actor was pulled out of complete obscurity to star in king vidor's the crowd 1928 one of the silent era's most prestigious films hopes were high for a great career but his celebrity faded quickly with sound pictures after a long string of tiny roles bit parts broke destitute his life ended in the waters of a new york river in 1936 he was only 35 years old br br while never stars of the first rank joan blondell 1906 1979 glenda farrell 1904 1971 enlivened scores of films at warner bros throughout the 1930's especially the eight in which they appeared together whether playing gold diggers or working girls reporters or secretaries these blonde brassy ladies were very nearly always a match for whatever leading man was lucky enough to share equal billing alongside them with a wisecrack or a glance their characters showed they were ready to take on the world and any man in it never as wickedly brazen as paramount's mae west you always had the feeling that tough as they were blondell farrell used their toughness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break over the right guy while many performances from seven decades ago can look campy or contrived today these two lovely ladies are still spirited sassy
<START> hilariously inept like she wore a yellow ribbon remade by five year olds br br spoilers ahead despite its title and the high bodycount slaughter trail is in fact a musical with injun battles instead of dance numbers br br if you ever wondered what ed wood might have done with a b movie budget this film should answer your question some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect such as filming in the short lived process which resulted in faces changing hue within the same shot but there was definitely some ill advised skimping on the film's main set a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a norman castle br br terry who later wrote the 'the bare for disney's the jungle book supplies a score full of original ditties which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a one song tells how horse hooves pound and their melody sounds like the serenade during a dead serious scene of a cavalry patrol other songs literally narrate the story shot by shot introducing characters describing their moods and gestures as they happen on screen and even stop to advertise the process br br the script sends ferocious navajos on the warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio by the end of the film what looks like a hundred navajos and have bitten the dust thanks to repeated footage of the same characters dying over and over but the chief is satisfied once he sees the trio of badguys have been slain as the singer helpfully informs those of us who weren't paying attention the navajos ride away their battle called off the cavalry captain surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades waves his appreciation br br the direction could most charitably be described as wooden or more to the point wood en navajos are consistently shot off their horses in pairs never just one virtually every red man on foot dies by throwing his hands in the air and keeling over the film also employs the most cautious stuntmen in hollywood who crouch before dropping off a one story roof and still fail to stick the landing or turn to look behind them as they slide dead down a rocky slope br br the star is brian donlevy who surely deserves an oscar for not blushing after the endless final battle scene climax is scarcely the word he scans a list of the dozens of his troopers killed and shrugs it could've been a lot worse trooper andy devine gets to sing and robber murderer gig young laughs at andy's antics which leads a character who had been held up by masked bandits to rat gig out i'd know that laugh anywhere br br and lest anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work howard hughes could be recall that as head of rko hughes was first in line to blacklist original star howard da silva when huac denounced him it would take hughes another six years to finish running that once celebrated studio into the ground but it didn't help things when he insisted on da every scene for this film substituting donlevy br br it was nearly a decade before da silva was able to work in hollywood again but all things considered for getting him out of slaughter trail he should have sent hughes a thank you note
<START> stealing time actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled rennie's landing which explains how director marc was able to afford this cast of now established television movie actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production about ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never got a theatrical release after it made the film festival rounds several years ago br br its recent distribution by franchise pictures probably reflects a perception that the rising popularity of certain cast members can be milked to recover some of the modest production costs although not a great addition to anyone's resume young actors have done worse things when they were desperately seeking acting work of any kind br br peter ethan embry scott foley and charlotte play college friends who do an early big chill reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure up to their dreams br br unfortunately nothing else happens absolutely nothing yes alec dreams about a liquor store holdup and a bank robbery which are then cheaply and lamely staged to completely inappropriate music it is the least suspenseful bank job since w c fields was the guard in the bank dick br br if anyone can point to any moment in stealing time where something actually happens i would like to know about it because as far as i can tell not a thing happens in the whole film perhaps through incessant visual reflections is trying to say something profound about taking control of one's life before it is too late like st elmo's fire the movie is littered with every profound thought ever uttered by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time br br i felt was going for a kind of howard hawks young professionals in action only angels have wings motif then again i'm sure i was reading much too much into the film after all things actually happen howard hawks films br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> an awful travesty of the greek resistance senorita cruz badly miscast as a greek girl there are plenty of attractive good english greek actresses so why pick a spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an english actor as her father supposedly a greek doctor many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from greek theatre and tv series the only foreign actor to my knowledge who has successfully portrayed a greek was anthony quinn as the macedonian miner zorba in zorba the greek as the in the greek tycoon and as a greek colonel in the guns of br br there is some historical truth reflected in the film people who remember the italian occupation of the islands agree that the italians were not harsh unlike the germans who succeeded them also mussolini's forces as hinted in the movie had been defeated by the greek army in the albanian campaign after the germans intervened in the balkans they allowed the italian military to occupy certain parts of greece so the refusal of the local government to surrender to italian forces rather than to the germans as portrayed in the film is quite plausible although i am not certain this actually happened
<START> purchased this film for one dollar and figured i could never go wrong my big mistake was watching it enjoyed the acting of ice t and the rapping which gave lots of class to this film about los angeles and the world of pimps there is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and who has a career but because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he retires he gets hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls that work for him at their trade and make sure they are not beaten up this boxer falls in love with the boss's girlfriend and all kinds of trouble starts this is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy
<START> even if you're not a theatre person i highly recommend that you see this based off of a play of the same name by christopher bond which in turn had been based off of an old london legend sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage the score is just amazing by far sondheim's best and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever the show was cast extremely well my only complaint being of betsy portrayal of johanna it s good mind you and she's a very versatile actress but she just doesn't sing and bird too well but other than that it's all phenomenal angela lansbury made the role of mrs and she just does it so well george was a good replacement for len in the title role and ken jennings gives a great performance as tobias the ending will give you chills top marks for a wonderful show
<START> oss 117 was fun from start to finish br br it's difficult to define why one film touches or connects with you or not and i won't try to analyze such perfect comedy so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it br br everything is old fashioned here from women's clothes sigh mambo dance the hero singing bambino sounds like an italian sung in arabic br br hubert is physically imposing but dumb as hell from all the he looks like sean connery but is definitely more because he's silly speaks his mind all the time giggles even has some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumours about him in short as an anti hero he rocks sometimes he only raises his eyebrows or frowns and that's all it takes to make you laugh br br is the true queen of the film graceful treacherous but with ideals to the contrary is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts it's surprising to see her that sexy bomb thou br br you just can't compare it with austin powers i agree with amazon's d hartley seattle wa on it being respectful to the genre br br which is your favourite scene one of my favourite scenes is the fight of the chickens with the masked villain but the truly perfect one is when chatting at the cocktail with his contacts how they all mutter platitudes with confidence this scene alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile
<START> the worst movie ever made if anyone asks you what is the worst movie you've ever seen tell them plump fiction of all the movies i've ever seen this gotta be the most lame experience even the poorest sequels are pure masterpieces compared
<START> i saw this movie yesterday i must admit i love it it's like early tarantino but better really a must but don't show this movie to anyone younger than 18 it's full of blood and sex rape scene is great now i'm just waiting for other movies of this director and a dvd release
<START> why on earth does five us keep repeating this one the title actually says it all the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you never heard of and that resembles to nothing br br you'll see ninety minutes of changing locations most of them will be blown up later on in the movie right in the beginning you see a nice little farm typical for the berry which is in the movie moved close to paris but then it does not survive the transport to the isle de france very well it explodes 1 minute later there are also two gangster who have no tongues as if that would make sense in the world of and internet let alone pencil and paper br br it just goes on like that nothing makes sense in this story my only credit goes to the cameraman the camera is excellent
<START> i loved the first american graffiti with all my heart and soul that i considered it to be the best movie about rock n' roll along with being the best teenager flick i've ever seen the first film spawned the careers of george lucas who would later do the blockbuster epic star wars before doing the prequels two decades later while making richard dreyfuss a star in jaws close encounters of the third kind and other films as well br br somehow without those two the magic died off br br more american graffiti shows audiences what happened to the rest of the characters later on in the sixties where steve ron howard and laurie cindy williams are protesting against the vietnam war while their friend terry the toad fields charles martin smith is in the war himself and trying to get out john milner paul le mat is still the hot drag racer in california where he never quite left home the rest of the supporting actors in the film from candy clark's debbie terry's girlfriend to the pharaoh's gang members along with harrison ford and others really don't do much the original film showed teenagers cruising the streets without any bloodshed with the early music of rock n' roll from buddy holly the chuck berry fats domino bill haley and the buddy knox and more that brought back the nostalgia bug in classic music the soundtrack for more american graffiti is a mixture of rock soul country hippie music and whatever fitted the mood during the late 60's of protesting drugs sacrifices and more br br after watching more american graffiti it looked like it wanted to show audience members what happened after the title epilogue of the four main characters in the first film with the exception of dreyfuss's character where it wasn't necessary this film wasn't necessary either as i was glad to see that neither lucas or dreyfuss moved on to bigger and better projects
