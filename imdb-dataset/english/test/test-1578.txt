<START> although it isn't half as hilarious as chicken run the new wallace and gromit comedy the curse of the were rabbit out of yields more laughs than most live action comedies british director nick park who created the wallace and gromit characters and co director steve box rely on the old fashioned stop motion method of animation known best as claymation to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough side splitting scenes about a monstrously mutant hare out to devour every vegetable in sight amusing as its whimsical storyline is the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which park and company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called plasticine basically every shot that you see in the curse of the were rabbit required patient souls that made minor alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable montage of merriment hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s before the industry turned its back on the complicated process aardman studio animators managed to crank out a mere three seconds of usable footage per day for the record the curse of the were rabbit took five years to make the lumpy looking characters with thumb prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions look incredibly funny with their ping pong ball eyes and over biting mouths interestingly gromit emerges as the funniest character a lovable mutt with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face who says more than most of the talking characters br br wallace and gromit are respectively master and pooch as the human half of the duo wallace is a looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to construct machines that do some rather incredible things one of the funnier scenes shows master and pooch awakened by a system of hatches and spring operated contraptions that dress and feed them meanwhile gromit is the animal half the running joke is that gromit shows more common sense than his genius of a master as good as his ideas and inventions are wallace could not succeed without the loyal gromit giving him a hand our heroes run a pest protection business called 'anti ' essentially they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using an ungainly looking device called a bun van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their ground and into a huge glass container no wallace and gromit don't kill the critters instead they keep them as pets and wallace experiments with an o matic designed to convert hares into carrot haters this frankenstein meets the fly approach plunges poor wallace into deep trouble when he swaps bits of his brain with that of a rabbit not long thereafter a mysterious towering terror stalks the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the village's annual vegetable contest approaches br br initially wallace and gromit appeared in park's oscar nominated film school project a grand day out 1989 since then aardman has released ten other animated shorts among them wallace and gromit a close shave 1993 and the oscar winning wallace and gromit the wrong trousers 1995 curse of the were rabbit differs not only because it represents the duo's big screen debut but also it runs a whopping 85 minutes the first two thirds of were rabbit contain better gags than the last third but park and company never miss a chance to slip in an adult joke that kids won't get but attentive grown ups will appreciate wallace and gromit the curse of the were rabbit is hare raising fun
<START> art imitates life imitates art atticus finch is reincarnated into the d a in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who done it and how did it happen the authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again the music is driving but not obtrusive the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience
<START> alain resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world in one of them is a sort of operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness only his attempt misses it's only real target the woman that he pines after in the same unfinished chÃ¢teau he built a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group meanwhile a bunch of kids fantasize a george melies like adventure of a prince that saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures and then kills the evil king bringing upon the kingdom of love the two primary themes life is a fairy tale and life isn't a fairy tale br br which sounds better than the movie actually is resnais is the type of director where oftentimes the concept is good or bad but the exposition is what matters here the concept is great but the movie is downright painful to watch horridly off tune songs bubbly characters without an ounce of dimension backdrops of sickening pastel instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone resnais drowns it in a bucket of cake frosting add some french philosophy and you get a weird witches brew one that doesn't bubble bubble toil and trouble but just kinda sits wrong in your stomach until you want to regurgitate it br br resnais is a risk taking director and even in his worst you can see he's trying something that might not work with full clarity of action in i want to go home he manages to pull past annoying characters and ditzy set pieces by showing some real change and having a moment few moments of quiet to catch his breath here he submerges directly into a fantasy that doesn't really reflect fantasy only its baby's room wallpaper reference the biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an 80s pop video and more kitsch than golden era hollywood musicals the fantasies are beyond childish and naive but the movie with nudity and profanity is definitely aimed for adults a target he decidedly missed br br however he sticks closely to his theme and never if anything this movie is impressive simply because its unapologetic br br polarisdib
<START> i sympathized with the plight of the first man we see killed in this episode he reminded me of the trepidation associated with being a lone security guard at night somewhere the type of work i did briefly about 20 years ago of course i was never in danger of being burned to a crisp as the colony chief lynch is fond of describing the monster in the dark here murdering members of a deep mining colony creates a scary impression in the first act we don't really see it in the early scenes and as many of us realize the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination 'big and is one voiced description but it actually turns out to resemble a big lumpy pepperoni pizza along the ground like a silicon centipede a limitation of the show's budget unfortunately this also shows in the latest matte painting famous to trek fans the only way to convey a long shot of the mining operations br br but the whole theme of this episode is about what's on the inside rather than outward appearances anyway sure this a newly discovered silicon based life form looks like a mindless monster at first glance thanks to spock's telepathic ability probably the best use of a vulcan mind meld for plot purposes we learn it's a highly intelligent even sophisticated creature besides spock's instrumental use of his talent mccoy gets to his usual medical routine healing a creature resembling rocks or asbestos he also gets to utter one of his most famous lines i'm a doctor not a bricklayer i found it very true to life in his scene where he in his success though he's unable to get kirk to share in his enthusiasm kirk's too busy organizing results the episode throws unexpected turns in character motivation at the audience as the story progresses spock champions the need to possibly preserve this discovered life as kirk takes his usual stand on preventing the deaths of any red shirts no half measures as in the man trap but later it's kirk who for some reason holds back on firing a killing blast as if the heat of the hunt had worn off and he'd had time to reflect on spock's point i believe it was during this episode's filming that shatner learned his father had died uncharacteristic for most of the first season this has a happy ending the conflict stems from the needs of basic capitalism such as meeting standard quotas versus protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants a space age version of protecting owls from the tractors of modern advancement somehow despite many killings and a sense that everything could go to hell at any moment with one raised kirk and spock manage to broker an agreement which satisfies everyone i guess people and are more reasonable in the 23rd century
<START> assault on precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest film i've seen since charlie's angels 2 the shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with br br spoilers i know they've said this movie is a remake descendant of rio bravo but did the writers of this film actually watch rio bravo besides the fact that rio bravo is a western classic the premise of the film was that the sheriff john wayne had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being liberated by his brother and his gang no one wants to liberate anyone in assault on precinct 13 they want everyone dead so my first question would have to be why not just burn the whole place down from the start why assault the place at all i know the contrived plot turn was suppose to be clever and shocking but it didn't make sense and or was presented properly if the veteran cop was in on it from the start why the need for this whole movie if the veteran cop suddenly cut a deal at the back door during the siege how did he even get the chance as soon as he appeared at the door he would've been shot and they would've had their entry point it's all just fubar br br what part of any city can an all out war take place at a police precinct complete with helicopters and massive explosions but no one notices however as soon as there's a fire they have to leave before the fire department shows up how did they plan to cover up the chaos that was happening outside police issue bullets in the walls bullet casings footprints equipment usage and the fact that there were going to be no bodies of bishop's men to be found how about those police snipers how could they possibly miss so badly so often i like the fact that when the two tried to run the snipers were foiled by two tiny mounds of snow as if it's not possible to shoot a high powered through a pile of snow br br the set up was interesting although ridiculous but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet to the head for absolutely no reason at all i know the makers of the film were going for shock but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and the anger of the audience don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from this one that particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth that and the fact that every plot turn is dumber then dirt the conclusion remains steadily stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an austin powers like diatribe instead of killing the helpless people who he has finally captured i know several people have mentioned the closing scenes that take place in the woods of detroit city snicker but why did ethan's character just wander off in to the woods in the first place he doesn't even look to see if the suv with the secretary and his friend gets away they just cut to him prowling slowly in the woods pistol in hand i could go on but won't all i can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all cost
<START> just finished watching this movie i couldn't imagine watching this on vhs as there were scenes where i needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect even though the scene itself was in english br br visually the movie is pretty appealing the few cg effects were very obvious but the prosthetics creature effects weren't bad not perfect but photography and editing which were pretty good made up for a lot acting was generally bad though how much of that can be blamed on the director i couldn't say having never seen any of the actors before the exception i think was m gomez she stole every scene she had a part in and not just because of a very pretty face but there was something akin to an urgency to her performance that none of the others had the writing could have been a lot better the plot was still unmistakably lovecraft and plenty of lovecraft details were written in but i personally could have done without most of the dialogue
<START> i don't know what it is exactly but the film is happily sitting on my shelf with no thought of ever leaving me fulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous bizzare cheez infested and well unique movies i've ever seen not sure what else to say about it but i love this movie the steak scene is absolutely uproarious and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious i'm not sure what fulci was trying to do but has anyone heard that based on this film fulci accused wes craven of ripping him off with scream cat in the brain is a must for bad movie lovers everywhere yes i'll definitely say it's not a good film but i guarantee certain scenes will stick in your mind forever this is an exercise in craziness people i guess if i were a serious critic i'd give it a 3 but on sheer enjoyability again i can't really explain my affections i'd give it a 7 really whacked out flick
<START> brotherhood of satan is one of the most underrated horror films of all times why it hasn't achieved a cult status is beyond me this is a chilling tale of terror and witchcraft which contains one of the most powerful and disturbing climaxes in the annals of screen horror in the small american town some children have disappeared and their parents been violently murdered what is the cause of hysteria the film is really eerie some scenes are genuinely unnerving and definitely not easily forgotten the suspense never lets up the acting is really good and the climax is bizarre and disturbing check out this forgotten gem of satanic horror absolutely recommended
<START> i really wanted to like this film as i have admiration for italian rip off cinema especially jaws rip offs but the simple fact of the matter is that monster shark isn't very good all the signs of this being a great piece of trash are there we've got one of the kings of trashy cult cinema lamberto bava in the director's chair one of the best ridiculous cult actors michael taking the lead role and a central creature stupid enough to give even the best that this sort of film has to offer a run for it's money yet somehow the film still manages to be rather stale the fact that the 'monster doesn't feature too often is probably a good thing given the creature design but there's never enough elsewhere to pull the film through without it the plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of florida or rather somewhere in italy where several local people have turned up in the water with arms and legs missing it's not long before the local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before and it's up to a motley crew of various sea experts to catch it alive br br the main problem with this film is that it always feels very pointless and since there is little in the way of characters or plot development even the least demanding of viewers are likely to start getting bored before long this sort of film is hardly famous for being brilliant although the fun element of films such as 'the last and 'killer fish' is unfortunately absent for most of the running time the thing i love about lead actor michael is that he always seems like he's taking himself seriously no matter what film he's in although he only ever made four this is certainly the case here although bava never really allows him to completely dive in and often he feels as much like a spare wheel as the rest of the film much of the runtime is spent watching the various characters american lager and it's not very fascinating although bava does manage to come good by the end with an entertaining flurry of action as the central monster finally gets to wreak havoc upon its would be captors overall there really isn't much to recommend this film for as mentioned i really like this sort of stuff and even i found myself bored on numerous occasions for hardcore italian horror fans only
<START> story wise this isn't among the best or most cleverly written columbo movie but the movie is extremely well made with excellent directing and truly fine acting br br especially the acting within this movie attracts the attention director nicholas did a great job with the actors in the movie appereantly he allowed peter falk and john cassavetes lots of space to play with also since both are being credited on here as uncredited directors of this movie must be part of his directing style to allow the actors this much room it works out extremely well for this movie perhaps he did this because himself also used to work as an actor he is perhaps best known for playing the role of coach in the hit series cheers from the very start of it in 1982 until his death in 1985 br br so peter falk seems better than ever before in his role as lt columbo also veteran actor john cassavetes does a real great job as the movie its murderer and is a good match for the lieutenant beside them the movie also features myrna loy a big star from the silent movie era and also pat morita in a small early role br br but not just the acting directing within the movie is real good visually and technically it's also a really great made movie with slow long shots without the use of any cuts also obviously the reason why this movie is longer than most columbo movies it really takes its time to set up things and tell its story the movie also features a couple of nice artistic and experimental kind of shots of course all really fitting for the '70's br br but like i said before story wise this just isn't among the best columbo movies also the clues being left out for the lieutenant are a bit too obvious this time it makes the murderer come across as a bit dumb like he didn't thought his plan over good enough while the character obviously is an intelligent man columbo this time also tries to irritate the suspect and other characters a bit more than he usually tries to do in order to solve the crime this and peter falk's different acting approach are a reason why his character might come across as different than he does in other columbo movies but different does not mean worse in this case br br the movie also features a quite good musical score by richard who after this became sort of the steady composer for the columbo movies br br a great columbo movie to watch br br 8 10
<START> i was only cautiously enthusiast when renting all the boys love mandy lane as i instantly remembered hearing reading a wide variety of opinions Â both positive and negative Â in the short period of time between its brief cinematic release and the distribution towards videostore shelves supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years with non stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change okay the basic concept may perhaps sound reasonably innovative but inevitably the screenplay quickly reverts to the same old and irritating slasher clichÃ©s and once passed that point even the nifty stylistic trademarks can't save the film from dreadful mediocrity the opening sequences are indeed terrific and literally bath in a moodily melancholic ambiance which actually makes it all the more painful to witness the film sink towards the ordinary level of rudimentary slasher flick after the sublime intro showcasing a drunk macho kid miscalculate his jump off a rooftop in order to impress the titular beauty all the boys love mandy lane turns out to be just another textbook and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic kids getting stoned and horny on a secluded ranch before getting killed off by a not so unidentified maniac the film's entire pretentious set up collapses faster than a ramshackle house of cards we never get a proper explanation why mandy herself behaves so frigid and haughty towards all her admirers because she grew up an orphan perhaps oh boo hoo the boys soon enough illustrate they'd settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the divine mandy and the final twist Â albeit undeniably offbeat Â is just plain senseless the middle section of is rather boring and doesn't even offer any genuinely horrific excitement shotgun killings please or authentic rancid sleaze my generous rating 4 out of 10 entirely goes to the grainy and unsettling 70's filming style with faded colors bizarre but beautiful photographic and the surprisingly marvelous soundtrack director jonathan levine opted for the classic bobby song sealed with a kiss to play during the trailer and end credits whereas i initially was convinced the film would inevitably feature barry cheesy love song mandy
<START> pink flamingos a representation of society's past br br pink flamingos a film directed by john waters in 1972 is a very disturbing portrayal of the negative impact a traumatized childhood can have on future life babs johnson grew up in a very non typical home blatantly you can see the impact this had on society through her actions up to the ending where she engulfs dog feces was this film just some sick and twisted perversion of endless gut wrenching occurrences or was it symbolic of something much deeper to side with the first would be the easy way out and to the side with the latter might seem demented but possibly true the film does have some credible resemblance to actual events of our societal past every leader that we as people view as displays similar characteristics to those of babs johnson ivan the terrible genghis khan adolph hitler and joseph all had childhoods babs johnson had a troubling childhood and therefore is associated in the same class as all of the previous mentioned rulers that is why a great deal of her actions throughout the film can be seen as disturbing however were her actions her own fault or society's for letting her grow up the way she did furthermore each character in this film represents either a past leader or event another coincidence is edith's obsession with eggs with an open mind this can be tied into the genocide and hitler's attempt to annihilate the jews some view hitler as a genius others a mad man john waters must have seen him as a mad man because his representation edith was indeed mentally ill edith's son crackers and traveling companion cotton are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard slavery both names are slang terms that represent a time period that most of us would rather forget theses characters are crucial in terms that it points out that in some times our society in america was no better than what we often view as horrendous acts of social onslaught in other cultures the chicken f king scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society in this time period and is still wrong chicken is a 1970's slang term for woman therefore it might be possible that john waters were trying to bring out the subject of rape through cotton and crackers actions the antagonist family if a single antagonist can be determined in this film was the marble is often mentioned in association with wealth therefore this may be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the wealthy a fight that still continues on today and will probably continue on forever pink flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes but should also be noted for its camouflaged political agenda that waters displayed so throughout its entirety
<START> european films may be slower paced and less plot driven than american films but this takes it way too far it also show a whole bunch of drawn characters doing inexplicable things it's not fantasy it's not even surreal it's just awkward and bad br br what's the message here that people in france are pensive and gaze a lot that they like to watch other people having sex they they spontaneously scream or touch a stranger on his neck do not wear a watch when seeing this film as you will be astonished at how little is explained or learned over huge stretches of time br br this is the story of a police superintendent who is deeply troubled by the brutal murder of a little girl though actually he seems troubled before then he is not merely upset at his own personal tragedies but apparently mentally quite slow behaving very much like a learning disabled six year old child he stares blankly a lot walks with arms rigid like a little kid speaks in meek simpering tones behaves quite oddly in all of his interactions though no one seems to notice or care even when it is supposed to be police business he's not a troubled cop more of an picture andy kaufman's character on taxi but without the humor he is not only not believable as a policeman he is not believable as an adult that he won an award for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing unless he was playing the part exactly as written and the fault lies with the weirdos who scripted this thing the plot is clearly secondary do not expect to see anything remotely like what police would do if a little girl was found murdered this not that important though the implausibility of their behavior is sort of insulting the problem is that the rest of the film makes no sense either that leaves the long lingering close ups of fields vegetable gardens people's faces etc the ending struck me as especially ridiculous totally unsupported by the events leading up to it unless you think what's the worst way this film could end br br there is lots of sex and nudity which is supposed to mean something you want vaginas you'll see vaginas not to worry it's art it has deep meaning what i am not sure and the protagonist despite his innocent weirdness seems to have some sort of homoerotic neck or fetish br br finally the subtitles are in white and frequently appear on a white background very hard to read many of them on the other hand there isn't much dialogue so this isn't a big problem there is also very little sound not even ambient sounds you would expect to hear in the film contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience the old woody allen would have had a field day parodying this work br br that this is an award winning film is sad i would hate to see the losing films br br enjoy
<START> yet again i appear to be the only person on planet earth who is capable of criticizing japanese films made before 1970 fires on the plain 1959 is another in the seemingly endless line of classics that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason as much as i love to and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film it's still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of masterpiece what i find truly ironic is that fans of derivative classics like fires on the plain focus so much on inside the box movie making orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting acting camera work etc yet it always seems like the most highly revered classics are most deficient in these very standards for example one of the laziest for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial most surprisingly the very first scene in fires on the plain uses this indolent tactic to the extreme br br after a funny head slap the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer why can't you grasp the situation we landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at we lost two thirds of our men our artillery was sunk in transit we tried to reach airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible the enemy's counterattack forced a across the valley you know that so why exactly is one character telling another character something he already knows oh yeah that's right the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information you see a quality film would actually show these events happening or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events heck even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here br br such instances of poor quality movie making are littered throughout fires on the plain to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles for example the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in japanese garb instead of doing the natural thing like Â oh i don't know Â giving a depressed mannerism the character blurts out japanese soldiers thanks buddy but i could have figured that one out for myself br br even worse this movie is saturated with over dramatic ploys the most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots picture this a soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots one would think that such a find is utterly useless but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his super worn boots behind fine i get the point the soldiers are in rough shape Â a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with the scene is ridiculous but i was ready to let it go until the second soldier arrives you see he finds the previous soldier's super worn boots and notices Â get ready cause here it comes Â that his boots are super duper worn boots lucky man he picks up the super worn boots and leaves his super duper worn boots behind but you see that's not all Â because the third soldier then arrives he finds the previous soldiers super duper worn boots and inspects them along with his own super duper worn boots since both pairs suck he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot at this point i was ready to throw my television through my living room window the heavy handedness and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film making it's super duper bad film making br br there are a number of similar completely stupid moments to be had like the time when the lead character asks someone hey are you dead like the guy is going to answer yes if he actually kicked the bucket i'll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction i laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid goofy expression on his face br br the fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an imdb average rating of 8 4 while a certifiable masterpiece like a tale of two sisters 2003 only gets a 7 5 is the height of mass stupidity and to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that doesn't make sense well not every movie can have completely outrageous super duper worn boots on its side
