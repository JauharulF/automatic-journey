<START> i'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is but i couldn't find it it's a really long barely credible hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set br br it doesn't move anywhere the characters are just totally bizarre the underlying plot equally so it's lost on me definitely a walk out movie br br the one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax and the fact that all irritation aside at the banal personalities they're acted quite reasonably but you have to brace yourself for endless dialog wishing on many an occasion that teach would just shut the up for a moment
<START> slow moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole but lovely locations clothes to admire and of course timothy dalton who does a compelling job as always i wanted to laugh out loud at the voice overs so silly but dalton is always worth watching even in bad movies a wonderful actor older now but still very handsome and masculine this movie is worth viewing only to see him and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel poor fellow your time would be better spent watching mr dalton in 1970's wuthering heights or the early 1980's bbc version of jane eyre poor ward so lovely but so wooden surely she's been better in other movies
<START> i only saw the first part of this and concluded that i wouldn't miss anything if i didn't watch the second episode the cinematography was ok but apart from this the plot was just as and run of the mill as any other war story the actors and actresses play their characters without any passion and the make up is really bad with his white hair and kai respectively as if some dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense i mean if you've watched more than two or three movies about wwii as most of us have then you'd only go to the trouble of seeing a third or fourth one if it promises some new insights or twists in the plot but roland richter seems to afraid of doing so you can almost smell his fear of not living up to the bourgeois and jejune expectations of the conservative tv channel while watching this movie millions of euros were spent to perpetuate boring and unimaginative german film making these millions of dollars could have been spent to make three or four independent movies but no let's give to some director who'll make a film that tells people that war can be explained by rational means my advice read joseph heller or kurt vonnegut instead they'll tell you what war is like or give me one million euros and i make a better film than this load of bs and another thing why is it that german movies only get to be nominated for the oscars when the movie deals with wwii or the holocaust probably because that is the only thing german film making is good at and that should get us thinking shouldn't it
<START> governments are elected for three year terms as reg said in 1973 the liberals were determined to continue forcing labor to the polls until they were defeated if you ask me this is portrayed in the docudrama but anyone who says kerr acted properly in this fails to acknowledge the self serving and costly strategy of the liberal party of australia on the series itself i though max phipps was a poor his voice was too ghostly also more of the key political players on both sides should have been used though this may have been a reflection of budgetary constraints at the time nevertheless i recommend it with caution
<START> admittedly when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie my expectations were pretty low they weren't low enough roger corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's and handed it off to whose directorial work has largely been in campy tv series such as and with a supposed total budget of 1 5 million dollars it was produced shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film there it should have remained however like a banana peel in a vaudeville act this fantastic four sits out in the ether waiting to cause a pratfall for those rare people unlucky and foolish enough to step on it br br if you have ever heard of these comic book characters you know what to expect the people who made this were very true to the source material and that is the only thing for which they deserve any credit in this fiasco this presents the origins of the heroic group that develop superhuman powers when the shielding on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation reed richards alex hyde white develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes 'mr his girlfriend sue storm rebecca can become invisible and her brother johnny jay underwood can spontaneously cause fire to erupt from his body finally ben grimm to both michael bailey smith and carl receives superhuman strength when his skin mutates to a rock like hyde and is then referred to as the thing there is a prologue that sets up a former classmate of reed's victor von doom joseph culp to become their enemy dr doom who orchestrates the sabotage of the fantastic four's space flight as an act of revenge for injuries he blames on reed there is the set up then the discovery of the powers the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climactic fight there are more details to the poorly written script but they are negligible br br this is a movie that was made simply because the creators i use that in the technical sense of the word there isn't a whole lot of creative imagination at work here had the legal rights to do so the plot will be undoubtedly mirrored in the anticipated big budget release set to be directed by tim story in 2005 but tackling a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of cinematic insanity what special effects exist are mostly hand drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original 'the great train when half of the climactic fight reverts to full on hand animation you're almost relieved to be watching a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were damned to be in this project there is very little consistency of style in this mess as well most scenes are either shot flat in available light or wild primary colors and the only dressed sets are the obvious sci fi pieces there is camera work but it is mostly just keeping the characters centered on the screen and minimal information flowing to the audience editing includes leaving in extra lines and using obvious wipes at one point there is even a transition using the center of a number 4 editing spins are even used to supplement the poor special effects when the thing transforms the one scene where morphing technology was put to use was shocking only because it was such a positive jump up in quality br br limited camera work is not unforgivable in 'clerks' only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style it worked for that film because it was about people whose lives had no style and it was consistent kevin smith never let his reach exceed his grasp 'the blair witch project' caused some audiences to suffer motion sickness from the jerky hand held stuff that put that pseudo documentary together when all was said and done it was an effective work about the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a frightening situation there is no sense of story or theme here on either a spoken or visual level with this four' you never get more than an accidental laugh at the fact that the film makers and performers seem to be actually trying to rival other comic book movies with this poorly budgeted entry br br any film involves a great deal of time and work it just so sad that so much of both was poured into a project like this if you're one of the people who were involved with this it was most likely done as a stepping stone on the road of a hopefully improved film career everyone knows about taking jobs to make the most of what appears to be an opportunity for those who are curious about watching this movie my advice is to only do so with a group of friends so you can all point and say you watched it too who have been forewarned about the experience so nobody gets hurt from the shock and maybe you can come up with a drinking game to ease the pain between the accidental laughs br br 1 out of 10
<START> saw this last night and being a fan of the first demons i had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun spooky spirit of it's predecessor this is unfortunately not the case the set up is similar as the first in which a horde of flesh eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played the first had been a movie theater this one takes place in an apartment building and on tv once the demons are released madness and mass carnage ensues that's pretty much it as far as plot development goes it worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish make up fx fast pace and unpredictability the sequel however doesn't cut it the first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we don't really care about one way or another if they were annoying or idiots then there would at least be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably butchered demonized eaten alive but these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered plus the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building and out of it they are constantly cutting back and forth between them which kept pulling me out of the story there are some amusing bits courtesy of the splatter fx and campiness such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one construction after another as if it were alien acid the first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party and a creepy demon child clawing his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child however that sequence parlays into a ridiculous looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim i got a couple of chuckles out of that scene but i don't think that was bava's intention the scene probably would've worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman but hey other little things like the over zealous acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing don't help matters in summation i managed to see the unrated version on dvd and can't imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available r rated version because the make up fx and gore were the only thing i got out of it also notable is an early role of producer argento's future hottie daughter asia in fact she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and she's barely on screen argento bava fan's might want to check it out just to see it but will probably find themselves looking at their watch like i did gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx but will be laughing themselves out of their chairs at the most goofy looking evil baby puppet since little selwyn from dead alive you could do worse but it certainly doesn't live up to the original
<START> some people don't like led zeppelin but luckily the number of people who versus the number of people who don't is way unbalanced i am the proud of 2 or 3 led zeppelin fans and the only reason i was able to do this is because of this dvd br br for one how someone can listen to stairway to heaven or immigrant song without falling in love with zeppelin is beyond me but to play the guitar and not like page that is like being christian and not liking jesus my friend was like led zeppelin sucks and i was like oh yeah watch this after about 2 mins of watching page pick through white summer black mountain side he was glued to the screen and has never said a bad thing about zeppelin since br br incase you haven't been following the running metaphor i am calling this dvd the bible of led zeppelin held high by the followers and used as a for the unwashed heathens br br course there are some things missing like over the hills and far away a good version of immigrant song and i really didn't need 2 version of whole lotta love but what the hell i'll take 'em br br because there is nothing besides the song remains the same to compare this too i gave it a 10 and even if there were more to compare it too i still would have given it a 10
<START> simply miserable lana turner vehicle had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of the student prince with adults is no leading man either he looks like an elderly man ready to collect social security and go fishing br br the plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of barry sullivan marjorie maine and debbie reynolds are given so little to do sir cedric hardwicke comes in at the end to announce that our king had better return to his people as far as i'm concerned the faster the better is that lana turner really singing with not bad if it is her the picture would also remind me in a way of the 1960 movie the prince and the showgirl with marilyn monroe and laurence olivier
<START> i tend to get furious when hearing about lucio fulci's reputation as a director too often he's categorized as a no talented filmmaker only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore true his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream american production but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid don't torture a duckling is yet another story this film is a pure gem of the italian shock cinema i easily dare to call this film a an old fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror the film shows the search for a inhuman serial murderer in a small italian mountain town the bodies of 3 young boys are found horribly mutilated there are quite a lot of pseudo madmen in the town but every trail leads to nowhere among the suspects are a greedy bum and a scary woman obsessed by witchery and voodoo like a true mastermind fulci knows to find the right creepy tone for his film he portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and inescapable setting of macabre happenings supported by a giddy soundtrack fulci also develops himself as a genius storyteller here the script always is one step ahead of you and the complex plot will mislead you more than once in other words this is a unique giallo horror slash murder mystery the gore isn't presented as grotesque and explicit as in later milestones among them are the legendary zombie 2 the beyond and the new york ripper although there still are a few nauseating and hard to watch shock sequences shown br br don't torture a duckling is the most compelling and effective achievement lucio fulci ever brought forward and it easily ranks among the greatest italian horror movies ever made right next to the masterpieces made by mario bava and dario argento the film is fascinating from start to finish some plot aspects are alarmingly realistic and the tension is adrenalin rushing at all times a must see for horror fans and an absolute priority for italian shock lovers
<START> just watched this and it was amazing was in serious doubt about renting the dvd or not so if you are and like watching other than brainless action movies don't hesitate any longer don't let the dull cover put you off the script is one of the best ever funny original touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie i had already watched another movie right before this one and was really sleepy and usually i get bored on watching a second movie in one night but this one really made me wake up and didn't have any boring moments it also made me rethink a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feeling br br also the acting is great one of kevin spacey's best roles the visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen if i have to come up with something negative to say about it well i can't really find anything enjoy 10 out of 10
<START> the finest short i've ever seen some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened due to the density of insight it offers there's irony in that comment and little merit the acting is all up to noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly i might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect this is a short for people who read for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty a beautiful short film i was pleased at the picasso reference since i once believed that picasso was just another art whore with little talent like i assume most people until the day i saw some drawings he made when he was 12 picasso was a finer and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime i understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for
<START> i found this movie to be filled with irony but watching the movie you can almost for see what will happen leila is a confused bored house wife who is constantly looking for happiness when she thinks she finds true happiness she clings onto it leaving behind all that she knew but she finds her self almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband she learned that if she only had communicated more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage that it could have been salvaged a lot easier that she intended it to be she realizes that words are nothing with out action but she learns that too far into her second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping for change once again the main conflict in this movie is leila vs herself you can not have true happiness with out yourself being truly happy i liked this movie but i would only recommend this movie to women i can't see a man truly finding enjoyment in this movie
<START> well unlike most people i went into this movie expecting it to not be that good and it turned out to be an awesome film pretty cool plot i love the idea of it but what really made this movie was the actors they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see fishburn and dillon work together it's a movie where you go in thinking right away you will be able to predict whats going to happen but it doesen't quite turn out how you predicted i don't want to give away anything about the story so i wont but i suggest giving this one a chance if you saw the movie money train and enjoyed that you would love this movie maybe everything lawrence fishburn touches is gold
<START> this isn't far away from the trash that bollywood normally makes but there's just something really good about it br br the title song is one of best and is haunting throughout this is one of the films along with a must see bollywood film that made shah rukh khan and it's for this you have to check it out br br other reviews give away the story it is a fairly basic idea sharukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star br br its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to bollywood or not 8 10
<START> i saw caddyshack ii when i was ten and i mostly laughed because of the horse scene i should have realized that the movie was as empty as i can't come up with a good comparison it's stupid and not even really funny the cast members from the original who chose not to star in this made probably the best choices that they ever made in rejecting this why oh why did chevy chase return and how on earth did jackie mason robert stack dyan cannon and dan aykroyd get involved in this swill i bet that every person who had his her name even remotely attached to this junk e g the caterer is ashamed beyond redemption so all in all it's beyond dreadful terrible and everything such avoid it like you would the ebola virus
