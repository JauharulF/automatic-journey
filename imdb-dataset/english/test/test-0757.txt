<START> this is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on tv i own all 9 seasons on dvd and literally could watch them over and over anyone who does not find this show hilarious heartwarming entertaining and laugh out loud hysterical is crazy kevin james is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there my boyfriend and i love going to stand up comedy shows in boston where we live and have seen kevin james twice and his brother gary valentine danny once they are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work there are so many comedians out there that are just awful and kevin and gary really show the true side of real comedy leah although a snob and bitch in real life so i have read is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms she truly makes the show along with jerry stiller this show is a must see and you will get addicted within one to two episodes
<START> one has to take martin lewis like a dash of salt pepper why does martin put up with lewis then again why do all the women in this movie like jerry because he is innocently likeable martin sings a few good songs lip at least once and jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other movies combined i generally find that i can take just so much of jerry's antics before they become aggravating but in this film watch when jerry gets stuck outside on a submerging navy submarine excellent buster keaton should have been proud i give the film a 7
<START> andreas arrives in a strange inhuman place where everything seems perfect he's given a good work everyone is kind to him and to everyone and he really doesn't trouble too much even in finding a beautiful girlfriend but in this no named city andreas finds soon that a perfect commercials type world is really not a paradise really one of the better movies i've seen this year the attractive plot is perfectly supported by a smart direction where every single component cool desaturated photography cold symmetrical design unemotional acting slow highly controlled camera movements helps in building an unique weird atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until the end a sarcastic ironic bitter comedy that made me laugh ant think as only best films are able to do nothing new probably in the analysis of the modern de civilization but really a smart work with great surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten from whom had the luck to see it simply beautiful the amazing scene in the metro underground
<START> i really liked this quirky movie the characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on tv it has a realistic edge with a captivating story line the main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch
<START> i was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater br br we have all seen this plot line before top gun gi jane an officer and a gentleman but a good script still works this story is basically about the training of a coast guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines kevin costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader ben randall who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission the movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the costner character and that of jake fischer played by ashton kutcher i am happy to say that ashton is great in this part br br there are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives however the use of humor the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ben randall do his own thing as a trainer kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained i really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud gasp here and there and clap at the end as a tribute to the movie br br we all had a good time despite a couple of tough moments in the movie and i think you will too
<START> this is one of the most laughably bad films i've ever seen i cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious perhaps he was connected with making it it doesn't have anything going for it there is no suspense the acting is dire the direction hopeless the music score is three trite notes played ad nauseam the plot must have taken all of five minutes to write the dialogue is what a 10 year old would come up with if asked to do a homework project the only slightly redeeming feature is the actor playing the psycho himself who grimaces and gurns magnificently and thus is amusing at times the only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder don't waste your time
<START> this film is so lovingly made you want to be part of it forever the flics are straight but not without malice the goods are transparent and evildoers are hardly there even the cabaret are so naive they'll make you daydream with nostalgia in comparison to anything available on tv blier is fine if a bit one sided louis jouvet is perfect you just can't have a better copper he has the best line my dad cleaned other people's dirt and i do the same is unbearable but i guess in part it's the songs wardrobe and hairdo simone on the contrary makes a great femme fatale if a bit silent i didn't realize she may be a lesbian as imdb user and others rightly suggest
<START> i thought that the love letter was a pretty good movie there were certain things that could have made it better but kate capshaw is absolutely beautiful and she showed it in this movie i wish that there could have been a few more revealing scenes of her but it was still a very good movie it was very fun to watch
<START> this is simply a good ole fashioned western not overly complex or long it doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment still it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning it features former partners randolph scott and glenn ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that ford's cheyenne rogers has been part of bank robbing he even steals scott's sheriff steve horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving in red valley is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead claire portrays countess a friend of who gives he and buddy nitro guinn 'big boy' williams a place to stay for the time being cheyenne desires to go straight but finds that hard when jack lester bernard and his bad bunch want to rob red bank it is actually jack who is behind the murders but troubled past is hard to get away from he and nitro will be charged with the murders they didn't commit the robbery was one cheyenne didn't commit and it will be who must somehow save the day before lester gets away with murder there are sub plots which include falling in love with alison mcleod evelyn keyes the irony of the story is that alison's father uncle willie is actually in cahoots with banker stanley porter hall in a planned united theft with lester to steal the town of red loot will uncover uncle willie and banker treacherous scheme will uncle willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him this film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout columbia couldn't have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such don't expect to get your socks blown off but the film is simple and well paced
<START> i can't emphasize it enough do not get this movie for the kids br br for that matter you'd best spare the adults from it as well br br all right perhaps i'm a little this isn't the worst kids' movie no let me rephrase that this isn't the worst movie made by adults for adults and somehow marketed towards kids that would be jack which i've been meaning to review gut like a fish br br adults won't learn anything surprising well if you must fast forward to just before the end credits for a educational bit about an interesting cosmic we don't usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way well duh i could have told you that so can four years of college at an art school but i br br i have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie most likely it will only upset them we get to watch the moment when russ was traumatized at eight years old there's a better movie kiki's delivery service that has essentially the same message but handles it instead of drilling it into your head and the adults will like it too br br by the way there is a moment in the movie made with amature mst3k ers in mind if they think of that other bruce willis movie with a sad little kid in it
<START> after seeing this movie i have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket fueled ninja action and white hot sexual titillation that is ninja iii the domination br br we all know that sho kosugi rocks that is a given but how about jordan bennett's ultra macho interpretation of his character police officer billy bravo mr bennett bravo you prove early on while trying to seduce the buxom christie played to perfection by one miss lucinda dickey of breakin' fame that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft i particularly enjoyed how you do not feel the need to step in and attempt to help her as 4 thugs try to rape her outside her gym oh you could have helped sure but by standing there and watching you let her know who was boss will wear the pants in this relationship i also enjoyed how mr bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or wear the wife beater tank top despite his gorilla like shoulders and back back and shoulder hair are hot and knows it and how about lucinda dickey all i can say is i see a sex bomb getting ready to explode she's got all the right moves as both a temptress and a martial arts whiz the chemistry behind dickey and bennett is what makes this movie tick you'd think she would hate him because he's kind of a cheesy jerk but no my friends the animal magnetism is too strong to resist and they bond like crazy glue sho kasugi is not as prominent as you might think though still a main character which is fine by me because all i wanted was more bennett and dickey he does seem to wear a lot of eye makeup which was nice to see the special effects wow that is all i can say i will not give away the ending but let's just say it will not disappoint i love ninja iii the domination and can only hope that there is a ninja 4 i give it a 5 out of 5 throwing stars disappoint
<START> released in english under many titles and the eeriest of them certainly is the eerie midnight horror show is one of the best italian rip offs of the exorcist to really appreciate this film you should have a sense of humor is at the same time sleazy but naive pathetic and sometimes even moving br br stella an art student goes to an old church to see the statue she's going to restore it's a wooden statue of christ a demonic christ maybe already overcome by evil or fighting against it or perhaps planning dark deeds the face shows infinite torment the statue dates from the 15th century is impressed by the mastery shown by the sculptor the statue seems almost alive she lives with her parents her mother love lives a dissolute life and doesn't care too much for keeping up appearances her father mario chris observes everything with disenchanted eyes br br the wooden statue will soon assume a human form ivan rassimov and possess in the carnal and spiritual sense an amazing scene the poor from now on will suffer the torments of hell br br the lovely stella was ravished violated possessed by the devil and now following his orders she will try to seduce others ain't she emulating her sleazy mother love who feels great pleasure when her lover whips her with a bunch of roses there is a scene so ridiculous as to be sublime and moving when stella runs in despair through the narrow streets possessed by the devil remember of a small italian town screaming her heart out luigi pistilli is a very good exorcist his performance is as usual intense the exorcism scenes the final battle are very very amateurish but this will only enhance the fun and or emotion if you've really got a sense of humor br br stella is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent and that's a factor that adds to your pleasure when she's naked but i think that the film could have explored more her natural beauty love is a very good sleaze companion her nude scene with the roses well br br other italian exorcist rip offs i would like to recommend for you are br br very sleazy and released uncut and digitally restored br br evil eye the exorcist was the main source of inspiration for evil eye but others films like for instance rosemary's baby should also be taken into account evil eye is completely over the top not that sleazy but with plenty of gorgeous italian and spanish actresses you'll be drooling all over the film the film is ridiculous the story doesn't make any sense but if you see it in the right mood you might feel moved a diabolical sect possession murders despair love investigation and beautiful women all around a wild ride br br if you liked evil eye see also ring of darkness this film can be found in the alternative market search this title in the imdb there are good reviews about it br br p s has many different faces it's exploitative but it can also be serious and moving it's cheap cheesy sleazy but not that much and it has an underlying moral message this strange brew can sometimes be very funny we all already know that is an exorcist rip off so why can't we see it on its own terms yes mario gariazzo was trying to earn a fast buck but he was able get the most out of a shoestring budget the story is well told the film is atmospheric and overall the actors are committed to their roles see the film with an open mind and you may discover two or three new things
<START> this film works on a lot of different levels it's a profile of one very cool couple a social commentary on aging and nursing homes a love story a musical i've seen uncle frank a few times and every time i watch it i'm not sure who to go call first my parents my wife a friend i've lost touch with but it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life and want to reaffirm the ones that continue expect a lot of laughs and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a chord i'm pretty sure they will
<START> i saw this in the theatre a couple decades ago and fuzzy recollection suggests that i liked it however seeing it for a second time two things stand out 1 very poor acting on the part of michelle johnson and 2 very poor music throughout br br it's not that all the music was bad some of the brazilian music was fine but the theme song and others that their way in were reminiscent of the worst of '80s pop music br br johnson's voice seemed all wrong possibly dubbed this was distracting br br on the positive side 1 the story's not bad 2 it's interesting seeing such a young demi moore 3 valerie harper never looked better and 4 johnson did look quite fetching in various stages of
<START> crackerjack is another classic aussie film as so many australian films like the castle the dish and sunday too far away it goes somewhere that hasn't been widely explored in film before this time it is the game of lawn bowls and bowling clubs crackerjack is a much slower paced sports movie than many you will find such as remember the titans or million dollar the characters involved are athletes in their own right this movie is a show case of a large area of australian culture and features a sport that is popular and on the rise of popularity in australia mick presents a classic unforgettable character it really is a must see
