<START> i doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read mansfield park or if they have it was not very well none of the characters are what they should be fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment while sir thomas who treated her very well seems to have accidentally fallen into aunt norris' personality additionally a first person narrative by fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character fanny is not an entertaining heroine and i would contend that she is not meant to be additionally in the movie version fanny flirts shamelessly with edmund from the very beginning when they have been raised as brother and sister austen's fanny would have from flirtation of any sort and the novel paints the fanny edmund pairing as highly uncomfortable as it should be unlike some other jane austen novels p p emma mansfield park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist it is a very different sort of novel than the others it is not meant to be a love story i watched this movie because i have just now finished reading mansfield park and i am absolutely horrified by what i see miss austen is rolling in her grave
<START> this movie has made me upset when i think of cat in the hat im thinking of cat in the hat books you know the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children well i though that this movie would be a lot like that but much to my suprise was nothing like the books insted it is more like young adult humor movie in one part cat is talking to a gardening tool hoe cat talks to it like it is his hoe agin adult humor the naming of his car i all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie under the rating you'll find mild cude humor and some double entendres i think in short this means adult humor i wish i could return this movie wal mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy
<START> this is a very visual film by that i mean that the dialog is sparse almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long takes beginning with the opening shot br br the silences however are broken by a stunning sound track that ranges from discordant staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins and interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams it's a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes one of the early visuals being a man walking along a street so preoccupied with his interest in a shapely woman that he walks into a lamppost one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in store br br a long time ago another movie Â love story 1970 said that love is never having to say you're sorry this narrative turns that idea on its head in a number of ways beginning with the main character toni a seemingly innocuous long term resident in a plush hotel somewhere in switzerland everyday week in week out he sits at the same coffee table enjoying the passing world his cigarettes his coffee his solitude Â and he's been doing it for ten years he sits he observes and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you'll find out about when you see this little masterpiece br br love is explored in another way in a direct counterpoint to solitude and reserved nature two older residents of the hotel are still much in love but the man wants to die in a spectacular manner when his time comes while his long suffering wife berates him for cheating at cards with the other guests one of whom is now knows about their squabbles their love the man's cheating his apologies to his wife and his whining how in a surprising and black comedic manner one of those surprise activities i mentioned br br but this is no comedy in reality although it does touch upon the idea of the human comedy in a sense the irony of life and what to do with it that decision had been made for ten years earlier when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel he keeps in touch occasionally and it is clear that he still loves his children now grown up and the sorrow in his voice speaks volumes but there's something more than just sorrow br br such a life as would obviously seem to be utterly boring and it actually is from many perspectives it is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost death like countenance however that the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes but not before we know that the female bartender sofia olivia magnani is very interested in and goes out of her way to pique interest in her br br and that's when things start to unravel for he eventually succumbs to her femininity and in doing so discovers once again the consequences of love ironically in doing so he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life and in a most spectacular fashion br br i know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic but to say more would spoil the film and story for you if you like italian cinema Â i love it Â i urge you to see this one the acting is superb the sound track chills the spine the camera work is truly innovative the direction shows the maturity of a true artist br br i know i'll see this movie again and again
<START> if you're one of those people who doesn't really like sci fi because of their sometimes far fetched ideas and surreal world perspectives you better stay away as far as you can from stuart gordon's space truckers it truly is an absurd space adventure stuffed with eccentric characters colorful kitsch and ludicrous plot twists in all probably never would have cared for this film if it wasn't for gordon's name on the credits this guy comes pretty close to being a genius in the horror genre with undeniable milestones like beyond' and on his rÃ©sumÃ© apparently stuart gordon likes his humor as twisted as possible he already went completely over the comedy top once with re animator but with the slight difference that the bizarre humor was effective there something that isn't really the case for space of the gags lead nowhere and the entirely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses in the end all that remains is an occasionally amusing but completely unnecessary mess dennis hopper and charles dance or at least a semi charles dance are always a joy to look at and the still stunning barbara crampton has a small role near the end of the film crampton was stuart gordon's regular heroine in previous horror films the story of space truckers is as silly as they come dennis hopper plays the self made loner who's fed up with his job who wouldn't be when you're transporting pigs across the galaxy for a company named he sees his change to flee while bringing his muse to earth they float into space pirates and find out their cargo is meant to wipe out half the universe stuart gordon wisely returned to making horror again after this little escapade since space truckers he already made the sublime king of the ants' and the absolutely brilliant
<START> a notorious big budget flop when released this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end if you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for you you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie you may not know their names but you know their faces heck even the kid from a christmas story turns up in a small part rent if from netflix if you read this i bet you will enjoy it
<START> if this film had been directed by dw griffith or stanley kubrick it would be recognized for what it is a cinematic masterpiece told with depth and subtlety and passion a film with no equal in the visual realm it is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation and of course what the reviewers could not abide is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick and jane tale like 99 of hollywood output its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts fears and emotions they even appear to be thinking something your average movie reviewers do not understand and cannot abide so they destroyed it see the original uncut wide screen version it is stunning
<START> a scientist george zucco wants to create wolf men out of american soldiers to fight the nazis but is branded as mad he uses a simpleton gardener glenn strange to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf strange constantly his dialogue with the tones of lon chaney jr in of mice and men has no idea what's going on only that he sleepwalks the victims begin to pile up including a little girl which modern viewers might find rather disturbing and two of rivals there is some good dialogue on how man should not mess with nature still prevalent today and play god motives may be honorable but his methods are most questionable and then there is his daughter anne who is sympathetically nice to strange yet has no idea of her father's deeds johnny downs is a reporter who gets on bad side by questioning him but wins heart thus creating the usual and always dull romantic subplot in classic horror films at 77 minutes this is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror film of the early 40's particularly one out of prc who released this one so the romantic story could have been trimmed for costs and to speed things up a bit zucco fortunately is never hammy he left that to bela lugosi who always hammed in a deliciously theatrical manner which endeared him to audiences and england's todd slaughter but try not to think of bride of the monster's laboratory while looking at the one zucco works in or some of lugosi's dialogue in that now classic cult film mad monster lacks a cult following more because it is not delightfully bad just has dull pacing in more than a few spots for prc and monogram lovers i would recommend the corpse vanishes or fog island higher than this
<START> the plot outline of this movie is similar to the original someone gets kidnapped the prince is incest with saving her turns into a swan the turtle frog first the bad magician as best they can and in the end anyways there is not much new here with the exception of a lack of well known voice talent sorry no palance nor cleese and thus jean bob was a
<START> the tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with art to more post modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post colonial feminist gender or lines the reason why version left me fairly cold is that i didn't have a clue what he was on about what is the underlying vision idea concept behind this rendering of shakespeare the previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy punk show but surely there is more to it isn't there this is not to say that there is no vision here just that i was hard put to discover it be that as it may there are still things to enjoy the punk flavour is refreshing and funny wilcox as miranda and jack as are wonderful i did not much care about williams as prospero not enough magic i suppose the switches between the old monastery castle and the very english world outside can be a little unsettling at times but i guess that is intentional all in all interesting but not quite the success i had hoped it might be particularly after seeing caravaggio
<START> a majority of exclusively made for video low budget fright flicks from the 80's invariably stink worse than raunchy old socks this particularly dismal and amateurish no budget chicago set bargain basement nasty necrophiliac nutcase on the loose bloodbath serves as a depressing affirmation of this borderline fact a bearded disheveled long haired bead and flower shirt wearing wild eyed psycho hippie fruitcake embarks on your standard random gruesome killing spree graphically slaughtering libidinous young couples who are engaging in strenuous coitus whenever the deranged lunatic attacks hmm do i detect a fairly obvious and self righteously puritanical have sex and die message here gee could be man boy is this mentally unbalanced sicko one real way gone pup after his female victims our certifiably crackers killer enjoys making love to their freshly slain bodies warning possible spoiler ahead towards the picture's end the corpse copulating crazy gets rudely interrupted by the cops while he's in the middle of doing the unthinkable with a nubile cadaver thereby provoking the foul pervert to cut loose with an understandably anguished and ear splitting cry of nooo now ain't this gonzo guy a definite sweetheart and a half br br too bad this flick is so poorly done if it had only been made with a modicum of flair and proficiency it could have been a sleazy little gem of a horror exploitation item alas wally koz's ham fisted direction lamar larry stubbornly static and immobile cinematography frankie hollywood insipid monotonously head banging hard rock score the pitifully cheap and unconvincing make up f x flat conspicuously uneasy plywood acting by a hideously all thumbs and unappealing non pro cast lethargic pacing too much screen time is tiresomely squandered on the police's drab efforts to catch the wacko an especially lame would be shocking surprise ending the mystery killer's true identity is guaranteed to have you groaning in disgust the uniformly boring incessantly bickering and positively braindead characters and a steady succession of dull soft core sex scenes that are about as erotic as watching two slugs mate for 90 minutes straight all add up to one profoundly putrid and unrewarding limp soggy noodle of a crummy clinker however to be fair this film does possess one stellar virtue the mad dog slasher has unquestionably excellent taste in garishly tropical louder than thunder day glo hawaiian shirts
<START> retro puppet master is complete and utter crap in particular the puppets look stupid and crappy the acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid this movie goes back into the the past where the dolls where first created thats not puppet master retro puppet master is rated pg 13 the first puppet master to be rated pg 13 the movie contains no horror or suspense the fact that this movie was a puppet master film boggles the mind because this installment doesnt have the buckets of blood good acting or any like the previous movies did dont see this movie dont rent it and dont even watch it f its on tv because this film is stale not violent and completely crappy 2 out of 10 as a puppet master fan i am disappointed seriously
<START> this show really is the broadway american idol it has singing the british guy a guy who's sometimes nice and a super nice woman br br of course it is different because there is a sing off and there's dancing and some acting we just don't see some of the acting br br i gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that i know a lot of people including me would make if they were working for the show the first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home i know they want to find the right danny and sandy but america should have the power to decide who does home there's really no point to the sing off the person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway another things i'd change is to see them actually act on the show what's broadway without the acting the last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people sing at the end the eliminated danny always sings the same song and the eliminated sandy always sings the same song as they exit since they sing it every week those songs eventually get annoying br br i admit to not being a fan of the movie grease but for some reason i am hooked this show is very underrated it has so many memorable performances and moments

<START> after seeing the previews awhile back i looked forward to seeing steve martin in a comedy that i thought might be a keeper unfortunately i was wrong problem was the previews were the only funny parts to the movie the rest of the movie was pretty much a bunch of junk scenes that have been done to death and characters we've all seen a thousand times br br this movie was proof positive that if you put enough cash on the table you can talk anybody into anything steve martin is a favorite of mine but this one was a big clunker the only actor in the movie who was worth watching was eugene levy he was the best of a mighty lame group
<START> before i saw this masterpiece i never would have guessed that a devastating and hideously contagious virus could be defeated by the use of prayers and ralf performance is gargantuan the realism incandescent i was so inspired i'm flying straight to tomorrow to crack out the and get my hands together for third world prosperity god bless this film br br seriously i'm going to have to watch troll 2 and anus just to believe that it is possible to concoct more clichÃ©d dialogue it's so tortured that taking a to your knuckles might well be preferable to sitting through it the only subtlety it manages to achieve is in its thinly disguised racism as the poor islanders turn to ineffectual dumb ass collective prayer which achieves nothing until the linen shrouded teutonic hero with his direct line to yahweh can provide a blood sample which the horn blowing yankee scientists can get to work on and save the hapless natives this movie sucks
