<START> i was an extra on this film in the part shot at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so i was one of the fleeing mostly mexican refugees running across the at ryan field in tucson at one point standing around in our turbans as we waited for another shot one of my fellow extras turned to me asked me what the move was going to be about i told him it was going to be a remake of lost horizons only as a musical there was a long pause then he replied man this movie is gonna suck pretty perceptive of him i thought i had a good time and made a bit of money but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie i can't sit through the whole thing br br if you ever saw the movie the swarm you can pretty much get the idea you get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is just bad the idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names then a good story and good writing aren't necessary just turn the big crank and out comes the product it's just not worth watching
<START> i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it eight different characters eight different perspectives at first i was confused by the way the story was moving along but then i realized that it was just one scene being shown over and over again just to show us the different perspectives of the characters br br at first you think the clerks are yelling at the teenager for stealing they speak in their own language which i and chris the teenager played convincingly by cannot understand the perspective of the clerks dispels that view i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes br br excellent short film hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film br br
<START> i have watched the root of all evil with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist i don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity br br he is obviously not a else the odds of 2 1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in god br br he regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do god one has only to look at the language used in his br br regarding faith this commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour just think about it when he gets in an electrician be believes that it will be wired correctly and turns on the switch when he gets in a plumber he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction regarding faith in science when i was in chemistry class i believed and was taught that the atom was the smallest particle and the onion skin theory of electrons both of which have now been discounted i was taught this as the atomic theory in stone' so to speak so why should we believe any scientist especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field dawkins states that religion will be the downfall of civilisation religion is civilisation can he or any other atheist please tell us what civilisation was founded and nurtured by atheism barbarism or savagery please he is now living in the last stages of a christian based civilisation and taking all the benefits from it without any admission for its source i found dawkins to be arrogant dictatorial judgmental an obvious believer in eugenics and a nazi in his attitude towards the young how dare he say what a parent can teach their child the child is theirs not the nation's and as the parents to it their genetics so do they their beliefs his dismissal of adam as he never existed as he has no proof was an example of this same attitude so i have no proof that joe blogs lives in new york but he well may do i just haven't found the proof yet that does not negate his existence i note his argument with the bishop of oxford that the is selective with what he takes and believes in the bible well dawkins also does this where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious statement he is also selective i heard the lot when dawkins came up with the altruistic gene what a hoot he is desperately looking for proof for his wackiness and as the man was invented so now we have this so called altruistic gene which us to looking after our young and other members of our the trouble is that all animals do this not just apes and with evolution it is survival of the fittest not the kindest and if he really thinks we are becoming kinder as a race he is not reading the same newspapers as i am i found his arrogance beyond belief in declaiming that as we only have this life we should enjoy it to the full so how does he equate this with his obvious position as a well off european to a destitute person in africa who has had all her family wiped out and probably raped and is starving will he help her i note that all his opposition to religion is a that they go to war well g k chesterton declared that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion b we are against using contraception and abortion and homosexuality all sins against the 6th commandment funny that br br as a catholic i find his dismissal of pronouncement of the dogma of the assumption in 1958 to be erroneous he never said that it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere by himself in case dawkins does not know it revelation ended with the last apostle would have taken years of advice and studied documents handed from down over the centuries to have come up with this pronouncement also as a catholic i find his dismissal of all religious people as satisfied what utter rubbish we everyday fight the world the flesh and the devil we are the church militant we are also able to glory at a sunset and admire the beauties of nature even if we believe in god the trouble with dawkins was that he interviewed whacky zealots and them to all of us
<START> pardon my spelling this is probably the funniest horror movie that ever existed think evil dead 1000 the acting is horrible you can see the makeup line on a certain lady's face there is a lesbian scene which makes no sense at all and the ending haha ohhhh the ending be prepared to have your stomach hurting from laughter now if you watch this film for more then 5 minutes and are still expecting something take a look at your self and ask what the hell is wrong with you this is a very bad movie meant to laugh at and enjoy for its pure silliness br br don't forget to watch all the outtakes after the movie you can see just how low budget the whole thing really was all in all this movie is a rare gem in demonstrating the pure and udder lack of talent care ability money and anything else you would ever need to make a successful film but its definitely worth watching
<START> admittedly there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic the ravishing woman first panics and then only a few minutes later she starts kissing the young lad while the old guy is right next to her but as the film goes along we learn that she is a little volatile girl or slut and that partly explains her behavior the cinematography of this movie is well done we get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective and some of those images and scenes really raise the tension george plays his character well a wannabe hot shot getting old and being overpowered by young men like the character wolfgang who i admired in hitchcock's the torn curtain delivers a great performance that although he doesn't say much he is by far the best actor in this play one critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of emergency nothing would really happen but then again how realistic are films such as mission impossible or phone booth given the fact that we are talking about a movie here and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that aren't very likely to occur in real life you can still enjoy this movie it's a lot better than many things that i see on german tv these days and i think that the vintage 80's style added something to this film
<START> el padrino has just been released in europe and is really kicking ass this film with its great cast damian blood in blood out robert wager jennifer tilly robert wagner and many more is the best gangster movie since scarface a film that everyone must see 2 hours full of action with fantastic unbelievable stunt br br gracias jennifer we are eagerly waiting for part 2 does anyone know if there will be one keep up the good work i loved it
<START> shame represents a high point in the career of a master ingmar bergman penetrating existential study of a couple on the island of dealing with surviving a long war liv ullman and max von sydow give painfully detailed performances in this spare stark drama the films intensity rests in bergman's keeping our focus on the minute intimate relations of his two characters both accomplished musicians trapped in a landscape they have ceased to understand we see the way the external pressures of the war complicate and their relationship both characters are forced by the material circumstances of the war to betray their own sense of ethics in one of the most powerful episodes bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematic medium by showing us a filmed interview with ullman's character that has been re edited and distorted for political effect by one side of the conflict and is used by the other side as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene br br
<START> i saw this once probably like most people my age 55 back in the 60's i understand the dissatisfaction with the final product by both families but this is a great movie it was a great opera but as a film it is wonderful this film should be released at least to video other generations can gain an appreciation of great music and story telling the cast was made up of some of the greatest black actors ever most have now passed away only sidney p is still with us please don't wait until he is gone and the film as all old film does becomes unusable do to the ravages of time again this is a great film which is something that one does not see very often today if at all
<START> after the funeral was absolutely superb and by far the best episode of the season i was disappointed with cards on the table that started off so well but let down considerably by the last half hour and i didn't know what to think of taken after the flood though i do remember being confused at the end after the funeral as i've said is one of my all time favourite poirot episodes up there with five little pigs sad and the abc murders i was afraid that they would ruin the story but instead it is very faithful to the book now i will say i don't mind changes to books and try not to compare movies and tv adaptations to their sources except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation doesn't do it justice that's why i disliked some of the like nemesis and sleeping murder and so far out of the poirots the murder of roger ackroyd taken at the flood and cards on the table are the only ones that really did disappoint everything else ranges from good to outstanding even the recent appointment with death despite the many deviations from the book which i admit isn't a favourite was surprisingly good thanks to the marvellous production values stellar ensemble performances and outstanding music score back to after the funeral the production values are fantastic it has a really cinematic feel to it and the stunning photography and splendid scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes the music was very stirring and even haunting and the entire cast give wonderful performances david suchet is impeccable as always as poirot and geraldine james and anna calder marshall are just as terrific but for me the standout was monica dolan as mrs gilchrist she is up there with donald sumpter and polly walker as the best supporting actor actress in a poirot episode that's how good her performance was all in all a must see one of the best poirot episodes by far and one of the more faithful ones too 10 10 bethany cox
<START> michael haneke is known for his disturbing movies like funny games this time he adopted elfriede die which is probably her best work so far jelinek always writes about abusive behaviour in families and especially of the suppression of women in a patriarchal society br br erika kohut isabelle huppert works as a piano teacher at the viennese she still lives with her mother annie they even sleep in the same bed already a hint of something strange erika bullies her students the same way she's bullied by her mother and secretly watches porn movies and plays sadomasochistic games with herself a student walter benoit falls in love with her but she refuses to simply sleep with him she wants to play her games with him but he's disgusted he reluctantly follows her rules which means disaster for both of them br br haneke has a very clear picture language everything is filmed in a almost way so the complex characters and story are enhanced br br people who don't know austria very well may be don't realize how essential the setting is for the story jelinek as well as other great austrian writers like thomas bernhard suffers from the coldness and in austrian families and society austrians at least viennese people are often unable to articulate their pains wishes they suppress their emotions so there often enough is no real love affection and nearness in their families in a society where it's more important to show a perfect facade to society even if this means to protect crimes within families as erika and her mother protect walters rape of erika to avoid a scandal than to deal with your emotional problems it's probably no wonder that sigmund freud founded the psychoanalysis in vienna erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother they only time they share some emotions is very violent and not at all loving erika replaces her hidden emotions with wishes for violence so that she can finally release some feelings but she has nobody who really wants to speak about her emotions so in the end she has to stab herself to ease her inner pain br br isabelle huppert shows her best performance of her career as well of most other actresses with a unsmiling face you often see only a hint of emotion in her face a quick smile a glance with her eyes and in the end her pain is masterly displayed without a single tear br br benoit and annie also turn in powerful performances but the movie belongs to huppert
<START> this small quiet harmonious movie grows into a masterpiece on human dignity it is intelligently structured filled with meaningful little details and important side plots it tells a story of one man with great humanity without positioning itself politically but fostering life as a precious right not an obligation and underlining individual's right to choose it enjoys the richness of different landscapes mental and physical and languages important detail outstanding acting by each of the actors especially unbelievable javier bardem his screen presence has such a force that you forget that this is fiction the movie has a wonderful rhythm it is beautifully shot and outstandingly directed it takes real talent to make a movie on such a difficult theme with understanding humour and heart six stars out of five
<START> george barry's death bed the bed that eats is at root a dark fairy tale told via a horror movie framework it is in my opinion one of the best films of the 1970s and it's downright criminal that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without barry's knowledge those responsible for this theft should be fed to the bed asap if you're looking for overt gore or rabid action death bed the bed that eats isn't the flick for you death bed is a gentler weirder drive in picture it plays like an utterly strange dream half remembered i'd recommend reading stephen summation of death bed in fab press book nightmare usa he describes the movie's vibe perfectly whether intentional or not i've noticed shades of death bed in everything from the phantasm films to michele soavi's cemetery man to the magic realism slipstream fiction of authors such as kelly link barry is an original and in a fair world i'm sure he would've followed death bed with a number of fantastically bizarre films
<START> this picture hit the movie screens on june 6th 1980 starring stephen as sergeant thor avery schreiber as captain butt j d hinton as buzz and starring playmate of the year dorothy stratton the picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for i guess criminals there ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship enters sergeant thor and his partner buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to when failing they call on captain who instructs his crew to fight back enters the gorgeous dorothy stratton who plays the role of galaxina who is man made robot an now a few thoughts on this picture this movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that i don't get into sci fi if you're into sci fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early sci fi movie titled battlestar galactica which aired in theaters in 1978 many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another sci fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled star trek now for the reason that i bought this movie dorothy stratton she is gorgeous in her one piece suit i think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage connie was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also on the picture alone i give this movie 1 weasel star and on dorothy stratton i give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this if you like pictures like this you can get the dvd version on amazon com
<START> yul brynner is major a singing dancing vodka drinking russian officer stationed near the austrian hungarian border during the hungarian uprising of 1956 in anatole the journey though the film has yet to be released on video or dvd it remains one of most compelling performances because of the political unrest a group of travelers cannot fly out of budapest but are put on a bus to vienna before they can reach the border however their passports are taken and they are detained for questioning by the russians led by major br br the major has reason to suspect that there is a hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country indeed lady is hiding a mysterious passenger paul fleming jason robards jr who pretends to be an american but fools no one she is helping fleming mainly to repay a debt she owed because of the trouble her past association caused him among the other passengers are a british journalist played by robert morley an american family played by e g marshall his wife anne jackson and their two children one of which is the screen debut of little ron howard br br major takes a romantic interest in lady diana deborah kerr and a romance of sorts develops between them she offers him nothing but disdain and a stiff upper lip however though we suspect that underneath her heart still beats the cold war intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing it remains however one of my favorite yul brynner films and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance
<START> the selection of the bloated boring and racist cimarron ranks as the worst choice for best picture in oscar history poorly acted particularly by the justly forgotten richard dix whose performance as the self centered and irresponsible yancey cravat ranks as one of the most narcissistic characterizations in screen history and leadenly paced the film is truly shocking today because of the racist slant towards its one black character who is introduced by being shown sleeping in a chandelier br br other comments by imdb reviewers have dismissed the attitude towards this character as being merely dated but many films that appeared during this period did not depict blacks as shuffling lazy mental in the manner that this behemoth takes great delight in so that argument seems weak to say the least but whether you regard this demeaning characterization as in shockingly bad taste for anyone at any time or merely the forgivable ignorance of a less educated era it is very painful to watch with 21st century eyes br br but even this might not matter if the film weren't the overlong bore that it is voted the best picture oscar at the 1930 31 academy awards when such enduring classics as city lights the public enemy dracula the dawn patrol and the blue angel failed to be nominated cimarron is by far the worst selection to join the oscar pantheon
