<START> if you feel like wasting 86 minutes on a film that makes no sense is badly written with a bad plot and bad acting then this little gem is for you recommended for those who are about to fall asleep major annoyance will be felt by the awake viewer do not pay to see this movie
<START> it is hard for a lover of the novel northanger abbey to sit through this bbc adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the tv screen in fact if jane austen herself were to see this she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out maggie adaptation has made northanger abbey into what it satirized the gothic novel and the readers of gothic novels br br the role of catherine morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to austen's catherine a open hearted generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her but the henry of the novel is not a snuff taking cane wielding sappy line making hero of a gothic novel he is a tease a nearly handsome man with a messy room and a living that's right henry is a clergyman a charm that is completely dropped from the script some of the best scenes from novel when henry completely deadpan outrageously teases the literally minded catherine on diction journals mrs radcliffe etc are not portrayed in the adaptation a large section of henry's personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted besides peter firth's appearance is not accurate henry is supposed to be 24 or 25 dark hair and a brown skin not 35 or 40 and blond br br there are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust who is the and what is she doing in the story why is john less of a dunce and more of a schemer why is northanger abbey a castle catherine of the novel with her romantic visions expects hidden passages and dark tapestries but is very disappointed to discover that northanger abbey is actually a comfortable modern house another element of satire why portray general as a drunk why does catherine have those strange visions of mrs allen threading her finger etc catherine's imagination only runs away with her at northanger with henry there to correct her gently and lastly why are so many facts concerning the family and mrs death altered unnecessarily to make the story more horrible ' all of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked br br
<START> this is definitely the worst vampire flicks of all times i started to watch this right after interview with the vampire and i was thoroughly disappointed not only did this movie's script have as big as the grand canyon the movie seemed to jump from one scene to another leaving the viewers thoroughly puzzled the vampire lestat played by stuart townsend was terrible having a good body does not make you an actor the end of the queen was too easy and sudden insulting the viewers intelligence i'll give this one star because aaliyah actually tried her best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good other than that i would advice anne rice to take an ax and start hacking those who destroyed her brilliant story
<START> i'll be brief i normally hate films like this but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go granted there are some major flaws in it some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end br br but what are they well it's got a cool little plot by no means is it original but it is better presented than other films of its kind the three main stars whalin johnson long put in fairly decent performances that more than make up for the distinct lack of quality from the supporting cast the fat cop and coach quinn really bugged me and the scripting is slick and witty even if it is poor in places br br the bottom line is though this film is so cute i grinned all the way through it and it has a place in my video collection purely because it could cheer up anybody you really have to be some kind of humourless bore not to like this i dare somebody to sit through this without grinning br br i do recommend this one if you want a simple fun and above all enjoyable watch you won't regret it br br top
<START> volcano is set in los angeles where a minor earthquake has just hit vacationing boss of the o e m the of emergency management mike tommy lee jones decides to cut his holiday short go in once there he sees that everything is alright but then drives off to the of the quake where seven underground workers have been killed by a fire or intense heat of some kind mike isn't sure what to think so he brings geologist dr amy barnes anne heche in to try explain things unfortunately a huge underground river of molten lava has been released after the quake erupts at the la brea tar pits sending the lava pouring out into the city streets anything everything it touches in flames mike his men the emergency services have their work cut out trying to stop the river of lava save as many lives as possible br br directed by mick jackson this was the second big budget disaster flick revolving around the idea of an erupting volcano during 1997 with dante's peak 1997 being released a mere two months or so before volcano was while dante's peak is hardly any sort of masterpiece at least it's slightly better more plausible than volcano is the script here is total nonsense is not based in reality at all underground rivers of lava that seem to appear then disappear just as quick various character's standing inches from a river of lava yet not being affected by the heat when that guy is on the train the metal seats around him start melting but he remains perfectly fine as far as i am aware human skin is not as heat resistant as metal is it it constantly happens helicopters flying is clouds of ash in reality it would be impossible one simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava what about down the other streets other directions being able to blow a perfect trench in a street then blowing a huge building up to make a massive dam when kelly sees the lava heading towards her car she gets out just like anyone would but then for some reason just stands there watches two firemen get burned to death waits for her dad to save her even though by this stage her leg has caught fire despite all those concrete blocks being placed together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes the guy's do such a great job not one bit of molten lava manages to seep through loads more besides like that massive building falling on tommy lee his daughter yet then both being fine afterwards the character's are awful too although they were not as clichÃ©d as usual with no romance blossoming between tommy lee anne heche minimal city who try to shut tommy lee anne heche up before the event labelling them there's a few badly written at times embarrassing moral moments as los angeles pulls together the black guy that semi racist cop who warm to each other by the end are wishing each other well that little kid at the end when he says 'everyone looks the same' is cringe worthy is surely a ham fisted attempt trying to say whatever colour we are we are still human beings we can all get along in time of a crisis as it brings people together having said that i think volcano is one of those so bad it's good films it entertains it moves along at a decent pace but just don't expect anything grounded in reality or any human drama either br br i suppose a film like volcano could be seen as an updating of a 70's disaster film such as the poseidon adventure 1972 or earthquake 1974 but on a huge budget with modern effects work speaking of the effects they are alright but none stand out that much the set pieces are also surprisingly forgettable sure there are a few impressive explosions a few ok river of lava flowing through los angeles effects but little else generally volcano just isn't very exciting while occasionally unintentionally funny completely ridiculous it doesn't really work in the way the makers intended br br with a supposed budget of about 90 000 000 it opened to a little under 15 000 000 at the box office it looks alright there's lots of fire but nothing stands out volcano is a pretty forgettable film overall filmed in los angeles i think most of the places featured here were shot at their real life locations the cast go through the motions with some terrible dialogue ridiculous set pieces to contend with tommy lee jones deserves better than this br br volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses it is a disaster themed film that ended up a bit of disaster itself worth it for a few unintentional laughs the ridiculousness of it all but it's nothing great i doubt i would ever want to see it again
<START> if filming is about vision and real life this movie is quite perfect talks about immigration in the usa from italy the beginning of but it speak also for now when emigration immigration is still a focus br br it doesn't to be rich to be a visionary film br br acting at extra level charlotte gainsbourg a star a good challenge for the academy award 2007 br br after first attempt an emotional but too intellectual movie this one has learned fellini's and lesson to name just two italian masters br br plot is arguing directing accurate maybe just a little less melodrama would be more effective br br if challenging for academy award next year by almodovar is a mature movie by an always brilliant director deserves it more because of his good effort to be a european movie for the american scene br br and this is it
<START> leland p fitzgerald ryan gosling has committed an unspeakable crime the stabbing of the retarded younger brother of his ex girlfriend becky jena malone no one least of all leland himself can explain why he's done what he's done whether the act was premeditated or spontaneous done out of hatred or love br br in the detention center leland meets pearl madison don cheadle a onetime novel writer who sees in case a second opportunity but pearl also wants to understand motivation and takes him under his wing as a confidante in the prison br br the film jumps from the past to the present several times often allowing the past to act as a context to the present and vice versa writer director matthew ryan hodge shows how crime and the events leading up to it affect the people in his life from becky to her family to mother lena olin and estranged father kevin spacey to allen chris klein a young man who is staying with becky's family after the death of his own mother br br the chief asset in the movie is gosling who is perfectly cast as the 15 year old like bartleby the scrivener leland just exists he shows little emotion during the film but instead his expressions belie an ocean of guilt sadness love and rage br br each of the main actors offered perhaps their best work to date save spacey who's not exactly a novice special praise is due to malone and klein two young performers who are better known for lighthearted comedy fare than the heavy drama of this movie br br another huge benefit in terms of the story is that none of the characters is flawless none are heroes out to save the day this is simply not a black and white movie
<START> if they gave out awards for the most depraved and messed up movies in the world japanese cinema would clean up their exploitation cinema wipes the floor with most other contenders the most extreme examples being absolutely jaw dropping exercises in bad taste nauseating gore freakish weirdness and misogynistic sex br br guts of a beauty is a prime example of such whacked out filth offering discerning viewers just over an hour of full on debauchery and gratuitous violence topped off with some very insane j splatter goodness br br the film opens with a young woman named whose search for her missing sister has led her into the hands of some nasty yakuza who proceed to rape her and shoot her full of strong dope called angel rain after the gangsters have finished having their fun with the poor woman she manages to escape and flees to a nearby hospital where sexy psychologist megumi attempts to help however the distraught and confused ends up throwing herself off the hospital roof turning into a water melon as she hits the ground at least that what it looked like to me br br seeking to avenge death lures a member of the yakuza to her office and whilst jacking him off him into attacking his fellow gang members after goes slash happy with a knife in the yakuza hq he is severely beaten and stabbed forced to tell of his meeting with and then hacked into itty bitty pieces br br the psychologist is then captured by the gang subjected to a spot of forced buggery whilst simultaneously being forced to give head to a yakuza slut and injected with angel which she promptly it the gangsters then plonk her body in the boot of their car along with the remains of ready for disposal br br before they can ditch the corpses however the super dope has an unexpected effect on she returns from the dead as a monster with a toothy penis and a ravenous gash and hellbent on revenge sets about killing the yakuza one by one this leads to some memorable scenes of outrageously gory splatter including a messy head a man being suffocated by the monster's oozing vagina and a woman being screwed to death by its giant gnashing phallus br br as you can most likely tell from the above synopsis this is some crazy screwed up stuff and probably not to the taste of most sane people but for those weirdos who have long tired of mainstream cinema and are already well versed in asian excess guts of a beauty should prove to be delightfully diverting and deviant fun br br 7 5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for imdb
<START> i watched it last night and again this morning that's how much i liked it there is something about this movie when the movie was almost over i was about to cry i would strongly recommend latter days to my friends it's definitely worth seeing i agree with those who say that some parts of the movie do not look very realistic for example both main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical shape although round is also a type of shape i rarely meet people like this as singles and i have never met any in couples other parts of the movie including all those coincidences do not look very realistic as well but after all it is a movie not a life story
<START> yes this film has many gay characters it also has straight characters characters who are not sure about their sexuality people who are searching for some truth about their existence br br this is not a film about sexual orientation it's about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another filmically denys arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting constantly shifting relationships the serial killer element is a bit less successful it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and unlike the rest of the film is thematically heavy handed br br thomas gibson centers and grounds the film it's a quiet performance but behind the handsome arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him the supporting cast is strong especially mia kirshner as gibson's friend a dom for hire with powers her role is more metaphor than a literal conceit strangely innocent and depraved at the same time she represents the light and dark of the characters' sexual consciousness br br the film's involving and often surprises in its character development the effect is somewhat like robert altman directing a david mamet script the dialogue doesn't shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning often in our search for love and a conventional relationship we ignore the love that already exists around us in our friends family those who are able to see us as we are arcand and the writer brad fraser make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways br br this film is a rewarding experience it may not be for bigots who can't get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater transcendental message of hope and redemption loneliness is a universal experience a film like this that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye deserves applause and an open minded approach
<START> the role of buddy ackerman is no stretch for kevin spacey he's played version of that character many times other better films this is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce the script leaves little time for plot or character development resembling a porn flick in its rush to get to the good stuff the difference is that here the good stuff isn't people pleasuring each other but inflicting pain making it appropriate viewing for young adults br br of course there's nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex and i guess there's nothing wrong with swimming with sharks if you want to watch people undergoing physical emotional and psychological torture but if you're looking for incisive satire interesting characters or anything else that even attempts to engage more than your basest passions you should probably look elsewhere
<START> i opted to watch this film for one reason and one reason alone samuel l jackson i happen to like him a lot i had seen no previews or trailers for this overlooked film so went into it with no real expectations br br jackson didn't disappoint as lazarus a down on his luck blues man in the deep south and delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever including playing and singing a number of excellent blues tunes but the real surprise here was christina ricci at best a vapid airhead in real life who took the role of the sexually abused town tramp rae and made her a believable almost even likable character watching the decidedly non sexual relationship evolve between lazarus and rae was simply amazing br br justin timberlake pop star turned wanna be actor should go back to causing wardrobe malfunctions and prancing around a pop stage his mostly forced performance was distracting at best from the real story here br br this movie is raw gritty and at times quite in your face not everyone will like it those that do however will be quickly moving it to the top of their favorites list
<START> i love military comedies sgt bilko stripes in the army now major payne and down periscope is hilarious but it has a heart as well br br the stingray ss 161 the uss was gorgeous absolutely beautiful a piece of art come alive so it was a diesel engine sub so what i learned that the aircraft carrier uss ranger which stood in for the enterprise in star trek iv a huge ship was which might mean that ranger was a diesel too br br my favorite scene pascal jesus this been on the stingray since korea this can expired in 1966 takes finger full and tastes it what's the matter sir it still tastes like creamed corn br br pascal yelling except it's ham that would be a problem br br it's story perhaps a wee strained seemed plausible winslow respected dodge and seemed to care about him so he wanted to give dodge a chance he gave him a battered but still class sub and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear navy and 'attack' harbor and norfolk 2 star admiral graham with his eye on his third star and a grudge against dodge assigned him the ragtag crew hoping that they would screw up so dodge would lose can tom dodge get the crew up to speed and working as a team and can he take an old out of date sub and beat the navy's best

<START> never before have i seen such a tale of such talentless hangers on been so ungrateful that their golden goose has failed to lay these spunk monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends i felt sorry for troy as he tried to hook up all of his friends with hollywood gigs but as soon as things turned sour they all left troy hanging overnight was a contrived effort of self indulgent retribution on a man who was going up against the forces of hollywood to retain story integrity the simple premise of overnight is to try an communicate the message look at this guy he blew it all when in fact he has a strong underground following dealt with harsh blows from friends and executives all in the name of getting a project done in the way he envisioned it quite frankly the only productive par that any of these guys played in the overall execution of the boondock saints shoot culminated as nothing more than extra bodies in the first bar room scene after that all they did was whine why they weren't a bigger deal based on the of their rancid efforts on top of shoulders the 2nd half of this was written by adam j farina
