<START> this movie certainly is a weird one to say the least the basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it the two whom show up fall in love the 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living together slightly weird here harry carey plays his part way off base you can't tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick i mean really make up my mind i can handle it then there is richard carlson playing james houston from texas hmmmmm he sounds way more like a southern gentleman from kentucky than a person from texas this one isn't even close then we take the 3 ghosts whom would stand a better chance of helping the new orleans saints win a play off game than actually helping out in fact they are really no help at all and why they are even in the film is beyond any scope of knowledge silly film in which a cast of characters act totally out of character you can avoid this one
<START> an excellent film for those who simply need to switch off and enjoy the beautiful scenery of scotland based on fact the film takes you on a journey of love amidst spectacular scenery the cast are down' for the parts they play so no glamorous costumes or hair in this film where acting is superb gritty and down to earth each character is believable giving a convincing portrayal of island life beliefs and culture of the time a definite for those who have even the tiniest drop of scottish blood as it will tug at the heart strings and stir the soul something that can be shared with the family and watched time and time again a real classic one that i am sure will walk alongside some of the great films that never die
<START> the parallels between this film and captain walrus an independant film shown at the team projection film festival in 1994 are so blindingly obvious that any praise for sally marshall is not an alien must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work br br in captain walrus two young boys geoff and roger played by dean turner and brett allen respectively examine the bizarre behaviour of their new neighbour britney played by louise farley as the two boys watch through their telescope they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call captain walrus played by peter sargent however the emphasis in captain walrus is on the pointless and somewhat power hungry actions of the neighbour britney and less on the friendship between the two boys br br a critical success at the film festival the plot of captain walrus has obviously been appropriated and rehashed in order to give the australian film community another notch on the belt with regards to children's product although sally marshall is not an alien is a fine film and a credit to its producers its leaves something to be deserved
<START> ok so it can be done we have here the perfect vampire movie gothic beautiful with all the ingredients a realistic vampire a wonderful story take note i am from transylvania and i assure you this movie respects the vampire lore it's exactly like the tales i heard in my childhood for a transylvanian it is quite believable you must see it if you are interested by real vampires as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent hollywood movies as far as i can guess the hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus which is pretty hilarious for me vampires are never good looking or attractive they can inspire only horror and repulsion the incubus called in my country the night flier is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them i strongly recommend this for any gothic person out there see also the sequels they are all 4 very good and of course don't miss dark shadows something similar is nosferatu in venice with klaus kinski i recommend that one to
<START> the bbc and the arts entertainment network should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this unfortunate production onto the world the acting is with the exception of robert hardy as general amateurish at best and excruciatingly painful at worst the costumes are over the top and feature some truly ghoulish excesses was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats surely every woman in bath didn't have feathers in her in the early 19th century the production values are poor and the pacing of the film makes one feel it was hastily and clumsily edited at the last minute altogether an agonizing film that i had to force myself to watch to the end it's a shame as the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and location shooting compared to emma thompson's sublime sense and sensibility or the extraordinary 1995 production of pride and prejudice or the subtle intensity of 1995's persuasion this production of northanger surely has jane austen turning in her grave
<START> i found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible i knew some of he facts about but here they were twisted and puzzling the images were weirdly interesting but i was looking more for a biographical and or critical accounting of life and works not an lsd type drug trip the dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting had it been labelled an artsy film i wouldn't have purchased the dvd now i have a dvd that i'll never watch again and who would buy it i prefer mainstream films not those that require translation or elucidation thumbs down on this one for me
<START> this movie was excellent from start to finish i was riveted by the action the black humour and the incredibly bad luck our hero encountered at every turn thomas jane is a great actor and i hope to see him in many more movies to come reading through other people's comments i have to admit i never once thought about tarrantino while watching thursday but now that i think about it i guess there are some similarities i guess i don't spend much time trying to relate everything to everything else the rape scene between and thomas jane is one for the record books sexiest scene ever
<START> i thought this was a really great movie especially since it was jut filler for me i was bored i got it from the library and i really enjoyed myself i've watched it twice in the two days and the more i watch it the more i like it i thought that the plot was going to be really corny but in the end it really could be said that it would be true i liked the main characters and i thought that they were well cast and you could see true friendship i thought they all did an excellent job the ending was good and you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys which is what a movie is supposed to be like
<START> as a fan of the book this work is fantastically adapted remaining true to the source materials and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work the intrigues translate well to film by virtue of ron howard's good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity br br i like hanks as robert langdon his portrayal is genuine and earthy with only the barest glint of the kip we all knew and loved back in the day he is a good dramatic actor and while i miss his comedic efforts i do enjoy his more serious performances br br the subject matter is no less controversial than the davinci code and the vatican seems to never learn their lesson as with the aforementioned film the holy see issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global catholic boycott of the film which of course generated millions in ticket sales br br although the story of the god particle was played down dramatically and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction the fiction that was left was entertaining and extremely well done and the truth be known people who have not read the book will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story as the screen version carries the main story well on its own br br in fact it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise in order to enjoy this second which should have been a prequel in all honesty although that does not lessen the effectiveness nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work br br all in all this is good for a friday saturday night's viewing although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones br br it rates an 8 8 10 from br br the fiend
<START> albert finney and tom are brilliant as sir and his dresser of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and of theatre and i think you listen better in theatre but on the screen we become more intimate we're close' more than we are in the theatre we witness subtle changes in expression we see better as well as listen both the play and the movie are wondrous moving intelligent illuminating of the backstage story of the company of historical context of the two main characters and of the parallel characters in lear itself if you cannot get to see it in a theatre i don't imagine it's produced much these days then please do yourself a favor and get the video
<START> this is easily one of the worst movies i've seen in a long long time and i've recently seen starship troopers 2 i could find nothing to redeem this film the acting which is probably the best aspect of the film is fair at best michael madsen hams it up in his standard character persona denis hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be vinnie jones accent is bizarre one positive thing is that leonor looks fantastic her acting is pretty poor but i doubt that's why shes there br br the dialogue is truly appalling it is quite simply rubbish i don't know who signed off on this but they really need to get professional help next time round br br this film is the reason imdbs rating system should be able to include zero stars out of ten avoid at all costs
<START> watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story john wayne rides up on this trading post saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies all he sees is the signs of a massacre some dead bodies signs of a fight and no one alive in sight that's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room the kind you find in old english murder mysteries br br the reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly catholic families clinging to the old faith in 16th century england built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith not something you see in westerns but a good gimmick br br unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought wayne to this place exactly but this was a b western and not even a good one at that br br gabby hayes is in this and he's clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time an unusual circumstance for the garrulous gabby br br if you want to bother and find out what happens and see a gabby hayes then see this film
<START> ernesto is a man that makes a living out of duping other solid citizens of their hard earned money together with manco an older man with a lot of experience he pulls out capers that allow him to make a decent living but that is not making him a rich man by any means enter federico an older man who is more experience in the art of deception together with the younger ernesto they prove a winning combination that only lasts until pilar former love interest appears in the picture br br this spanish film directed by miguel bardem is light in tone and pleasant to sit through other better made caper films have been made with much clever plots than this one but the film is easy to take and at times it has a lot of funny situations br br this viewer will see federico in anything even reading the telephone directory he is an actor's actor we have had the privilege of having seen him in the buenos aires stage doing excellent work before his international film career as federico he does what he does best it's impossible to imagine anyone better in his role ernesto alterio the son of hector alterio is a young actor who promises to have a great career victoria abril makes pilar fun as she gets involved with these con men miguel alexandre a veteran actor is also good as manco
<START> i really like this show it has drama romance and comedy all rolled into one i am 28 and i am a married mother so i can identify both with and experiences in the show i have been watching mostly the repeats on the family channel lately so i am not up to date on what is going on now i think females would like this show more than males but i know some men out there would enjoy it i really like that is an hour long and not a half hour as th hour seems to fly by when i am watching it give it a chance if you have never seen the show i think and luke are my favorite characters on the show though mainly because of the way they are with one another how could you not see something was there or take that long to see it i guess i should say br br happy viewing
<START> michelle pfeiffer is ideally cast as the frustrated mob widow in this colourful black comedy matthew modine plays a clumsy fbi agent who has taken a fancy to her dean stockwell steals the show as the big shot who keeps on pfeiffer mercedes ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife it's all very eighties but that just adds to the fun a nice little flick though not for every taste
