<START> smashing film about film making shows the intense and strange relationships that can develop between directors their actors the manipulation and mind games the preening egotism of performers as in any workplace sexuality complicates matters but here to the nth degree as they are filming a sex scene br br absolutely fantastic performances from gregoire colin as the fragile wannabe macho male lead and supremely anne as the director's self portrait the image of her laughing eating a banana at the end having finally got what she wants out of her puppets is pure delight
<START> total garbage no reflection to washington heights what so ever if i had four arms i'll give it four dumbs way down acting performance worst than storyline truly over rated hour and a half of visual torture rather watch ben movies for the rest of my life feel bad for the films that lost to this crap what were the judges at the film festival watching total garbage no reflection to washington heights what so ever if i had four arms i'll give it four dumbs way down acting performance worst than storyline truly over rated hour and a half of visual torture rather watch ben movies for the rest of my life feel bad for the films that lost to this crap what were the judges at the film festival watching
<START> gore hounds beware this is not your movie this little nail bitter has very little blood and guts its basically a version of open water that is effective and worthwhile but what sets it apart is that we actually like the three leads unlike open water who find themselves up a tree when a crocodile flips their fishing boat and munches up their guide we don't want any harm to come to any of them so when they start getting into dangerous situations we actually care br br now i like killer animal flicks but i haven't been too impressed with lake placid up to primeval although i'm still waiting to see rogue and hoping it is somewhere as good as this one but this little bugger did the job and did the job well it's scares are creative and it only lapses into the run of the mill frantic crying sobbing and arguing for brief stints of realism so i never got annoyed br br i remember reading the true story that inspired this where three guys went fishing and two ended up in a tree while their buddy was killed by the crocodile but the thing that always impacted me that gets left out from the film was that the crocodile didn't eat up the buddy no for hours and hours he swam around the tree and shook the dead body still in his mouth at the friends in the tree seeming to stay if you come down here this is what will happen to you
<START> this is a snuff movie i'm shocked it is even considered to be in the imdb library and bill julia and all other professional actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick i thought i was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent that usually make no sense when writing a horror film but as a viewer we try to rationalize and understand this ending was not creative it was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie i am shocked it was edited to this ending and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of june 2009 it should not be shown in a theater it is harmful to innocent minds on many levels watch the movie the ending and you will understand this statement plus included in the plot is a sweet little girl not yet 9 her character says she is not in the snuff ending but she is an integral part of the movie why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition the director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film
<START> i see that c thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor br br i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet related plot and to see how much older c thomas howell is i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s br br in just a few words what a very big disappointment i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame within the first 15 minutes of the movie this elusive woman is chatting with an asian guy in a they basically stimulate themselves to their own chat she then insists on meeting the participant in person she meets him has sex ties him up and then murders him in cold blood the plot then deteriorates further br br the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff do not bother renting it much less purchasing it even if it is in the 1 dvd bin i plan to take my copy of the dvd to goodwill i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating
<START> mercy the movie actually starts out as a somewhat decent film and ellen barkin does give a strong performance but if you have read the book and actually got to know the characters and cared who done it the movie just does not compare it is always hard to brink a book onto film and this one ends up failing 3 out of 10
<START> does anyone remember braveheart it starred mel gibson who also directed and was scripted by randall wallace the film contains over 200 errors does anyone remember the green berets that s the john wayne western where the duke saves a homestead called vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe if you watch we were soldiers you can t help but be reminded of these two films br br first of all what s with that scottish lament that s played three times in the movie four if you count the end credits i mean what s the connection between scotland and nam maybe wallace is using it in the vain hope that because braveheart was bombarded undeservedly i might add with several oscars then so might this film whatever reason it s included it really jars gibson plays hal moore as a cross between william wallace and john wayne and i was expecting him to say something like they ll never take our freedom the hell they will and it s impossible not to notice other similarities with the green berets like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the wayne movie br br when not reminding the audience of other movies also fails to stand on its own legs it s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in america not asia hal moore might have brushed up on the french experience in indo china but if that s the case then he was unique because the american military went out of their way not to read up on the french indo china war indeed when asked about the previous conflict replied he had nothing to learn from the french who haven t won a war since the days of napoleon so i was confused as to the portrayal of the nva in this movie when in 1965 the american high command brimming with hubris held the north vietnamese and vc in contempt it s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of vietnam are superlative warriors they are but very few americans believed this in the mid 1960s br br there s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead no bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who s been killed in the la drang valley likewise we re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the americans out number the nva i put these down as directorial editing blunders on the part of wallace who doesn t strike me as much of a director and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle take the scene where the american burned to a crisp is flown away screaming tell my wife i love her this should have an emotional impact similar to that death scene in platoon but here there s no impact in fact i found the scene cliched and patronising and he s not the only character to mouth the words tell my wife while mutilated or dying i counted at least two other characters use the phrase did characters actually say this at the battle i ve no idea but since randall wallace wrote the script i do have reservations br br i sat in shocked awe watching apocalypse now platoon and the killing fields made my eyes water i laughed at full metal jacket i kept looking at my watch with the deer hunter and after seeing we were soldiers i felt totally patronised
<START> susan sarandon is for lack of a better word incredible in my opinion and yes i do understand that not everyone will agree with me here she is one of the greatest actresses ever and should have at least 2 oscars to her credit i mean that was an amazing performance in lorenzo's oil but then i think every performance of hers is amazing and they gave it to emma thompson what was that about and by the time she got this oscar she'd been in the industry for some 25 years i couldn't think of anyone who deserved it more especially for a performance as brilliant as her portrayal of sister helen but then again she is over and above all the artificiality of hollywood and doesn't need an oscar people know she's good anyway br br this film carries some very deep thought messages so needless to say it is not to be taken lightly tim robbins of course can't escape credit here you would think that because of his person feelings against the death penalty the portrayals made in this movie wouldn't be accurate however both sides of the death penalty debate are given even weight on one side you see the interesting side of matthew the human side which makes witnessing his death rather heart wrenching at the same time you see the way he savaged his victims and the constant torment of the understandably grief stricken parents one word for tim bravo br br a brilliant movie and like i said a well deserved and long awaited oscar for susan
<START> i'm a christian and i have watched pretty of christian movies but this one is too bad they try to make this good but it's too hard for them i think br br you can see the film is badly dubbed in many places you can almost think that the in this film was the only ones left behind i think there will be a lot more of them br br the quality is poor and the acting could have been better too the story is not so very bad but could've been better the only plus i give is to the story in this film but totally i can't rate it more than 3 10 watch left behind instead
<START> i do not have much to say than this is a great finish to the story most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy but think about it everything was explained in you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it they did the best that they could do and i think that this should be taken more as a final fmv the last fight br br graphics 10 10 absolutely amazing br br story 8 5 10 don't think they could of expanded it that much more and the stuff they could put in there was clever enough i thought br br characters 9 10 well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins br br sound 10 10 since i am a metal fan i loved the fight music and piano just reaches right in there it is a great st and i was not disappointed br br tilt replay 10 10 enjoyable every time br br overall 9 10 ff fan view 10 10 br br i personally think this is what was needed a fight to end it all the plot was already in place the action was necessary as much as people complained i loved every second of this movie it was a pleasure to visit the world of just one last time br br just remember this most movies that have been made form a game have been directed by movie directors i think this is pretty great for a team of game directors don't think i've seen a better game to movie br br thankyou square i think you did it right
<START> not really worth a review but i suppose it's my duty to warn you all especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this canadian bomb floating around out there bad acting and a slow moving absolutely atrociously boring 'coming of age' tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods at the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model however all this changes and you still won't care you will recognize chris penn whose biggest cinematic impact is corky romano and a young devon sawa whose career peaked at i was hoping for a '12 and 'the war' or and all i got was a waste of time this film struggles to keep it's audiences attention and never makes an impact or maintains a note of anything remotely interesting
<START> it opens with your cliche overly long ship flying through space all i could think at this point was spaceballs and hoping there'd be a sticker on back that said we break for nobody the movie then shows some with vin diesel's narration i've always thought his voice sounded cool ever since i saw fast and the furious from when i found out he was as criminal i thought the movie was going to be cliche it was it was very cliche and fate seemed to be against them at every turn black out every 22 years lucky them they land on that day aliens can only be in the darkness hey it's a solar eclipse as much as i thought it was too easy and just a cliche the movie pulled through and kicked major ss i even went out and bought a copy of pitch black after seeing it i really can't wait for chronicles of riddick
<START> of the four main players in here john candy jean kelly amy madigan and macauley the only one i've never heard about at that time was the one that annoyed the heck out of me and ruined the film well she must have done a decent job of acting to make me want to throw her and the vhs into the garbage pail i am referring to kelly in the role of teenage brat tia russell ironically six years later she played a stunning and extremely likable role in the person of morgan in mr holland's opus br br candy as usual is fun to watch as buck russell or the title character uncle buck few actors were better at playing a lovable hapless slob than candy i enjoyed his character in here but i cannot watch that spoiled teen girl more than once also in the first few minutes of the film the little boy miles says the word g damn how bad is that having a six year old kid saying the lord's name in vain on film these hollywood people are such sickos no wonder many of their child actors turn out to be mentally screwed up being a case in point
<START> cooley high was actually a drama with moments of comedy it was a reflection of high school life back in the day i attended coolidge high in washington d c from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was in cooley high was an every day thing at coolidge as a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling coolidge cooley high getting high shooting dice chasing girls basement parties and fights that sums up high school life for many in d c back in the day i can't forget motown because motown music began and ended many a day back in the 70s the hits just kept coming however cooley high adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in cooley high my classmates and i had a lot of love for each other and like the characters in cooley high there was life after high school but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from to seventh period thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times cooley high is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories some good and some bad
<START> being a russian myself sometimes it's hard for me to get the reference jokes about american tv personalities or celebrities apart from that family guy is the smartest funniest and most politically incorrect shows seen on earth the voice acting is excellent and sounds clear enough even for a non english speaker as myself to comprehend animations are good too maybe even too good for a tv show here we have the equivalent of the adult swim channel but nothing there simply compares to this gem not even simpsons or south park hope the creators will continue to entertain and amuse us don't want to see the whole thing spiraling down into mediocre entertainment
