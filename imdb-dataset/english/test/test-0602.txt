<START> if you watched the series and love the league as i do then prepare to be disappointed i went to the cinema with a group of die hard league fans and we were all in agreement that this film wasn't as funny or dark as the three series before in my personal opinion it was a money spinner the writing was contrived and the plot confused no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do it was self indulgence of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms i hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series i will not be buying it despite owning most of the league memorabilia
<START> don't believe the hype if you have high hopes or have anticipated this movie to any degree you may be disappointed even the hilarious and talented steve carrell can't save this poorly written over long silly spy flick for the purists fans of the original tv series this movie bears little resemblance to the original characters and influence agent 99 and maxwell except for their names are simply not the same characters there are several isolated references to the original but not enough to convince this fan that it is anything more than a poor shadow of the tv version for those not familiar with the original tv series you may not be disappointed but chances are you will be bored there are a few cheap hollywood political shots as well really pathetic and oh so typical for an election year we left after the first hour and weren't alone some left after 20 minutes
<START> arthur hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man probably the ozarks who goes hunting with his favorite dog however the dog appears to be drowning when hunnicutt jumps in after him it becomes obvious pretty soon that despite hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death yet oddly hunnicutt is really slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him i think this was actually done as padding as there really wasn't enough material to fill the half hour time slot br br later in the surprise twist he comes upon heaven or at least his concept of the place he's invited in but since they won't allow dogs he has other ideas overall reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value with no twists or irony this episode is a bit dull not twilight zone y enough for my tastes
<START> i recently read the story to see how these two match up and if you can believe it this film improves upon balzac the story is moved around i think to drive home the idea that colonel chabert is a man who has suffered much and yet he comes home not a hero but as an outcast br br as someone mentioned i was initially confused if chabert was akin to the return of martin guerre no it is firmly established by balzac that chabert is the real deal what's interesting though is not is he isn't he but how his wife and society treats him br br i think this is a timeless story of men who go off to fight for their country and when they come home time has left them behind chabert is a tragic figure made all the more poignant by the amazing gerard depardieu i don't care that he's been in 1 million films he's captivating br br fanny ardant has a horrible character to play once a prostitute rose has used her feminine wiles to climb the social ladder are her emotions true for i think they are and perhaps couple that with her social standing at the time and you start to feel some empathy for her br br is slowly his way into my heart he's exceptional here as br br i think if you can get your hands on this gem of a film you won't be sorry french cinema at its finest
<START> you have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when whistling in the dark opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s br br on top of some weak one liners and ordinary sight gags the plot is as far fetched as the tales the fox red skelton tells his radio audience you have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it but then that's how unrealistic the comedy is br br but if you're a true red skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the '40s you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting him ann rutherford and virginia grey do nicely as his love interest and conrad veidt as always makes an interesting villain one of his more amusing moments is his reaction to skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans i never knew that he muses impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced br br all in all typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are not always easy for a discriminating viewer as many of them simply fall flat the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one liners has simply worn off
<START> i had the privilege of being one of the still photographers on the set of grand champion and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days i worked on the movie i have been in the photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and i can't think of a time when i enjoyed providing my craft more the kids were wonderful to work with and little emma roberts has so much energy she's a real trip she even grabbed one of my camera during the scene rehearsal and started shooting some of her images were used for pr i could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget but i doubt i would have had the fun and been around so many great actors and the great people of west texas as i was
<START> i liked this comedy so much will smith does not do anything slow it is always right on target with the greatest scripts and comedy that keeps you laughing and involved in the plot you are watching a skilled comedian who plays all his parts well one fully believes he is who he is playing i loved him and tommy lee jones in the men in black this comedy rates right up with that movie the humor is fast moving and will smith is as sure of himself as he was in men in black quick witted and well skilled in the art of making others score each time but doing it in a tasteful manner and with finesse br br will smith seems to have honed his comedy routine well he was so darn funny i loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate and his face swelled up and he looked more like cassius clay after a fight then he did himself then seeing him sipping on the bottle trying to bring his head back down to the right size i laughed so hard he knows how to make us all laugh
<START> no more beef and cabbage for her br br this little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists some imaginary scenes and a costume party all of this is centered around the wife of the husband s who is looking to break out of the doldrums played by gloria swanson she is twenty here both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods from frivolous to worried to hopeful br br behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love there's a little corniness but director demille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all as with many films from this period the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying or thinking but often give a kind of philosophical insight as if to justify the tragedy or and there is that higher purpose here probably better without the instructional text but it's part of the narrative style and it's kind of quaint br br if you are looking for visual or formal amazement you won't find it here but as a story well acted and filmed with precision and economy it's really a great example the events might not come as a total surprise but it's such a modern love story set almost a hundred years ago it's a gas and did i saw swanson was perfect
<START> every episode i saw when i was an innocent child was stupid there were some funny looking puppets called the mitts who would always discuss childhood things they would play this song before the mitts part of the show that goes like this let's join the mitts there was a groucho marx puppet that told jokes before the session this man would sing hot fudge right on there was a green puppet with teeth that was called seymore we would always see more seymore he would crack jokes and sing every episode there was always a moral in every episode one episode a man sang liars are losers another episode he was singing about sharing and caring seymore said tell me about those two little girls sharon and karen the hot fudge holey part has this man doing weird stuff and they played weird music
<START> i saw borderline several years ago on amc i've been looking for it ever since it was haunting visual textural sensual this movie took me somewhere like a dream and i didn't care where i will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze i still remember the way it made me tilt my head i remember my facial expression when i saw it i didn't know what had happened when the movie was over but i find life is that way it didn't bother me the unfairness of the ultimate rejection of an innocent character strikes me as sadly real i loved the faces the way the camera dwelt upon them the camera gazed at the set with the unfocused eyes of a borderline was real to me in a way movies aren't it was exactly the lack of explanation color sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night i love this movie someday i will own it
<START> john sayles what have you done br br silver city had moments in which i could see the glimmering hope of a good story well drawn characters thought provoking dialog and then those moments would quickly be covered over by layers of poor writing clumsy direction and abysmal acting i truly love almost all of john work but silver city is ghastly br br i got the feeling that sayles may have been working on the beginnings of a good story involving the illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines but then he got rushed and stuck the secondary plot line satirizing the bush administration onto it the two stories don't really connect with each other and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3 4 of the movie causing me to lose patience with the whole affair br br the other major flaw is danny huston's acting his dialog in every scene is delivered with a gawping grin regardless of its to the mood i hated this guy by the end of the film having been reminded of every bad actor in every high school play i've ever seen not having seen huston in anything else i don't know whether to blame him or to blame direction of him more regardless he's the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate movie br br right down to the last sledgehammer subtle final scene i was disappointed by silver city sayles at his best or heck even sayles at mediocre can be so very much better than this film see any of his other works instead this isn't even worth a rental
<START> set during the hungarian revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle jason robards out of hungary into austria however three things complement the story making this an extremely good movie br br first the actors use the actual languages of their roles the russian soldiers speak only russian the hungarians only hungarian the germans only german except to the minimal extent to tell the story since debra kerr is english she speaks only english and of course yul brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented english as a result the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount the viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when he she cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages the audience is never at a loss for following the film no subtitles are necessary br br second i was in hungary in 1995 and i'm telling you this movie has it right on from the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes the realism is incredible if i didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie i ate at its double i thought that i actually walked down the main street in that village actually the film was shot in austria br br third and most important this movie reunites kerr and yul brynner after the king and i and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of oscar qualified of course yul already received an oscar for playing that relationship so the acadamy wasn't going to give him another one but that is the quality of the film don't miss this one
<START> this is one of several period sea faring yarns of its era which has the added distinction although not in itself unique of a female buccaneer at its center at first both leads â jean peters and louis â might seem miscast but they grow nicely into their roles eventually thanks no doubt to the talented players herbert marshall thomas gomez and james robertson justice who support them velvety voiced marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor and gomez is suitably larger than life as the pirate br br the cast is completed by debra paget as wife who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in whom instills the first pangs of love which however does not spare him the occasional flogging or sword wound incidentally the film was the second exotic teaming of and paget in one year following delmer bird of paradise the direct result of this unexpected softening of character is her falling out with crew and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded paget and marshall br br while the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type jacques energetic direction and franz grandiose score ensure an above average effort that moves along at a brisk pace incidentally tourneur had already done service in the genre with the superior burt lancaster vehicle the flame and the arrow 1950 as usual with vintage technicolor productions the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating by the way differing running times are given for this film 81 or 87 minutes and for the record the version i watched was the shorter one
<START> probably the worst movie i have ever seen it is so cheesily filmed the focus is not even on this supposed real half caste it is more on the crew coming from hollywood to make the movie no cinematic significance whatsoever and if i could take back the almost 1 1 2 hours that i spent watching this film i would feel much better br br at first it starts out giving you the impression it will be filmed somewhat generically like an actual hollywood production however then they go into the narration of the story and it's filmed so f ing terribly it's supposed to be a take on blair witch project really since they pretty much use what you would think is 'real camera footage' it's not don't be fooled br br worst movie i have ever seen on the positive side it has like one semi scary scene in it and the visuals of the half caste weren't too bad looking at all don't rent
<START> how is it possible to like and dislike the same movie br br the plot is very much like that jody foster thing only not as good nicole was great jude was adequate they didn't give him many lines is there a reason for that generally he's a pretty good actor she's so elegant his character is so country bumpkin it makes one wonder what they see in each other br br romance between two such was only successful in lady lover br br i think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long they could have told the story in two hours br br the story is good good locations good filming the character actors were great
