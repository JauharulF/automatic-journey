<START> i tried to watch this adaptation but it was just so awful i couldn't torture myself like that the performances were quite sub par with the exception of ariel fonda was way over the top in a role that should be handled with some subtlety i have studied shakespeare and seen many adaptations and this is by far the worst one i have ever seen i have to wonder why on earth someone made this film shakespeare can and has been beautifully adapted in many cases this is not one of them if you must watch this film may i suggest a drinking game take a drink every time they go off book from the original idea and two drinks every time fonda overacts you should be quite drunk in a very short time
<START> this is an amazingly well filmed early talkie adaptation of the eugene o'neill play its major drawback is a static camera and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is which is a pity for it's a good piece of primitive moviemaking made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their maker's intention garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as she was in her silent films and her entrance is still classic her voice is strangely deep almost boyish which only enhances her already seductively eccentric persona as her boyfriend charles bickford is appropriately virile he was apparently born craggy and a perfect counterpart to the divine garbo his irish brogue is not bad at all and he seems always a natural man of the sea very o'neill like in his independent brooding nature as garbo's very confused father george marion seems truly from another time he has the sort of face and voice open unmannered totally without guile that has vanished from the earth marie dressler is also in the o'neill swing of things her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis poetic license perhaps as this is not in the script but we can forgive miss dressler's excesses she is too good at it not to the story ends with a movement to the next thing as distinct from resolution which isn't the author's cup of tea and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise in anna christie we are in o'neill country a place of sea storms and fog a feeling of all pervading and uncertainty which we would now call or anxiety neurosis rather than analyze this mood the author simply and wisely presents it as weather land ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel to have heard
<START> this film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow it accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads the steadiness of the camera work avoiding 'rock video' clichÃ©s that were actually invented for the beatles in their first two films tight editing and a non judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god or demon yes there are minor holes in the plot and incidental details that are a little unnecessary and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics but the issue here as in the much more recent i walk the line or carpenter's famed tv elvis biopic of the same era is whether the meaning of the performer's life in its time and place as a catalyst for fans' ideals and appreciation is made manifest in the performance and this is clearly the case here we come away from this movie understanding not only how buddy holly became a star but why i don't see what else one could want from the film
<START> are sea side resorts the sad dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels certainly this movie along with the near contemporary don't look now depicts venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap for a more light hearted approach see just married with ashton kutcher and brittany murphy having never been to venice i can't say for sure but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from luchino visconti one of the great of world cinema having seen the movie i now wish i had gotten around to reading the thomas mann novella it's based on which also inspired an opera by sir benjamin britten since i don't know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition i'm left wondering about dirk bogarde 's obsession with young is he a homosexual a pedophile or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent perhaps reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung fu at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not particularly long and it moves at a leisurely but hardly sluggish pace the film benefits from the ravishing music of gustave on whom character is clearly based dirk bogarde gives a moving performance and the movie is graced by the presence of one of italy's great beauties as mother
<START> everything is illuminated is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of the jonathan safran foer novel this version is more about changes in eastern europe from world war ii through post cold war and how the younger generation relates to that history as a family memory br br debut director adapter liev schreiber retains some of the humor and language clashes of the novel mostly through the marvelous eugene as the u s beguiled ukrainian tour guide he is so eye catching that the film becomes more his odyssey into his country and his family as he goes from his comfortable milieu in sophisticated odessa to the heart of a cynical isolated land that has been ravaged by through the communists and now capitalists with both jews and non jews as detritus as funny as his opening scenes are when he establishes his cheeky bravura we later feel his fish out of in his own country when he tries to ask directions of local yokels br br uses elijah wood as the american tourist as an up tight cog in a visual panoply as his character is less verbal than as one of the narrators in the book he and play off each other well until the conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this streamlined plot once the grandfather's story takes over in the last quarter of the film marvelously and unpredictably enacted by boris the younger generation does not seem to undergo any catharsis as they just tidy up the closure br br schreiber does a wonderful job visualizing the human urge to document history one of his consultants in the credits is professor and her style of remembering pre holocaust life through artifacts clearly inspired the look and it is very powerful and effective br br the czech republic stands in for the ukraine and the production design staff were able to find memorable symbols of change in the cities towns and countryside as this is now primarily a road movie and the long driving scenes do drag a bit schreiber retains some of the symbolism from the book particularly of the moon and river but having cut out the portions of the book that explain those they just look pretty or ominous for atmosphere and no longer represent time and fate br br as w c fields would have predicted the dog steals most of his scenes for easy laughs in general schreiber does go for more poignancy than the book it is irresistibly touching especially for those who haven't read the book but less morally and emotionally messy br br the film is enormously uplifted by its marvelous soundtrack which ranges from songs and from gypsy band to traditional tunes to contemporary tracks to paul fusion score br br this is not a holocaust film per se being a kind of mirror image of the train of life train de vie as about memory of a time that is freighted with meaning now but will resonate more with those who have an emotional connection to that history
<START> i'm glad this was the last of the '40's universal mummy movies the movies were all of qualities and this movie was definitely one of the lesser ones br br problem is that it's a very slow moving movie in which basically nothing interesting or exciting is ever happening perhaps it would had all been better if the mummy had made his entrance earlier on in the movie instead now the movie once again spends its first 20 minutes explaining what had all happened in the previous mummy movies by also once again using archive footage from this time the mummy from 1932 again to which this movie is the fourth mummy movie following the 1932 mummy story the movie just never knows to find the right pace and even though the movie is barely over an hour long it still feels a bit like a drag br br it of course also doesn't help that the movie has a rather simplistic and actually very little interesting story the movie also feels quite disjointed the first and second half of the movie don't really connect to each other and they seemed like two separate movies on their own br br at least lon chaney jr is still in it he once more reprises the role of the mummy kharis for the third time too bad that he has such limited screen time this time he gets unfortunately very little interesting to do which is also a big waste of the mummy character itself the movie is further more filled with dozens of silly actors who are playing around with silly accents it seemed so totally unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and it actually gets quite distracting and annoying at points br br the mummy movies that's least worth seeing br br 4 10
<START> penelope of wayne's world fame made her mark with the documentary the decline of western civilization about the la punk scene in the late '70s and early '80s most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts which often turn violent overall we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies whereas the hippies were into being natural the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible what with spiked hair and all but also we see how they're really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads br br anyway this is a really great time capsule we're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it but this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral truly worth seeing
<START> this was a hindi movie hindi horrible reasons cheap dialogues cheap special effects cheap directing stretching a 2 hr max movie into 3 hrs br br spoiler little bit br br specifically for this movie 1 dialogues are not funny they are cheesy and cheap though akshay tried his best acting for which i admire him comedy was not funny at all i laughed only 3 times during this movie 2 first half of the movie was useless to the story of the 2nd half the 2nd half was the actual story movie the first half was time pass build up 3 the characters are not developed properly at all paresh rawal is smart in the first half an idiot in the 2nd half rest of the movie we don't really develop any feelings or caring for akshay and govinda their characters are stupid nothing more they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties jokes are funny but they are not funny in a very serious scene the characters of the gang and the drug smugglers are cheesy and have been used in last 20 movies there is nothing new about those characters again they are shown to be stupid for being funny however stupid funny when stupid is the norm throughout the whole movie the only character that made sense was that of lara dutta with a real story 4 special effects were crap at the end ppl r off the ladder of a fire truck you notice that they are not actually on ladder in air secondly ppl start to fly off when the ladder starts to move around ppl can't fly off a ladder when its moving they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity 5 the whole movie was dubbed all the dialogues were recorded after the movie the actors' lips hardly to the dialogues br br there are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap but i can't remember them look at this masterpiece of crappy indian movies by non intelligent even stupid director yourself and you will agree with my review ppl who like hindi movies please increase your expectations for decent quality in hindi movies br br let me say that not all hindi movies are bad i like some i did not like this one br br 1 5 10 1 5 for the effort by akshay and lara
<START> i was very curious to see this depardieu outing plus the time period is definitely fascinating being a fan i was disappointed and that may be an understatement the film never really took cinematic flight there's no foundation for the animosity between and robespierre etc br br basically the script was weak adapted from the affair and yet the direction was masterful it's afterall also there were some amazing actors but they never really grab the audience's attention like they should depardieu comes off as a quasi goofy nonchalant not exactly the image we have in mind is incredible as usual but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent can't break down and linda pop up as and saint just and if you're familiar with then you'd know them br br overall i was disappointed with this much lauded film great cast great director but no quality foundation bad undynamic script we need to get in and general j mindsets what are their motivations eh who knows one likes women the other powders himself ok so if you're looking for a great french revolution movie i highly recommend la revolution it's in two parts and oh so great excellent performances in depth script juicy tid bits definitely a satisfying experience klaus maria brandauer is a much better than depardieu the wonderful apparently took some notes from and is brilliant as robespierre see it now as for fans you're better off with man of iron marble promised land and the like cheers
<START> i am so glad when i watch in every time the movie of ray for the sidney of the 21st century jamie foxx who played this role as an evidence of his brilliant ability as an actor to take his position beside great actors in hollywood by his golden supporting for the strong abilities of afro american actors all over the times and periods by his eternal work as an evidence for the eternity of ray charles as a grand prove for their legend appearance in every time by their success for winning oscar prize as best actor for leading role an best mixing sound between fact and cinematic scenes upon ray and jamie as a mixing between two copies of ray ray of the past and ray of 2004 acted in the person of jamie foxx it was nice from the director to choose those songs to be adapted with dramatical scenes in the accidents of film to enter for the atmosphere of success in legend corn with legend movies in hollywood since 1893 till now and his cleverness of choosing sharon in the role of ray s mother that she succeeded in this role by brilliant analysis for the core of her character that ray s mother was the turning point for him upon her grew up to be independent on himself to take his place in this world and to be icon in his talent as nat king cole louis armstrong duke ellington and at the end of this film by receiving his honorable report from and their decision to take his song georgia on my mind the national anthem for this state he made his promise for his mother to be alive until now by his legend songs and brilliant life
<START> i saw the film and am very pleased to see a film so different in character and story to the stupid mainstream american major productions its a film with a background interesting for young as much as all age groups contrary to certain reviews the audience seems to split my evaluation as the film is very successful wherever yet exploited worldwide for example in netherlands is was ranked number 3 negative statements must be respected but one should expect such to be guided on a fact basis if you have the chance view the film and enjoy it
<START> what this movie is not cool entertaining br br what this movie is visually interesting difficult to get through intentional br br i feel that this movie puts the viewer if he or she is willing through a clip of time where they experience a world without language much like how animals must experience the world you don't really watch this movie as much as you witness an awful series of events in what feels like real time br br consistently it goes on much longer than is comfortable this movie could be edited down to a 20 minute short and it would be a totally different movie it would be cool and entertaining but the experience would be lost i have seen a lot of cool movies but i have never experienced one like this if you can get your head in the right place for this one you should be able to really appreciate but likely not enjoy what they accomplished here 10 out of 10
<START> i'd have little to add to bull's eye comment here but as the first brazilian born raised and living in rio de janeiro in a neighborhood just a few miles away from the of depicted in the film to comment on u s financed rising here on imdb i get mixed feelings on the one hand it's good that the dire situation of brazilian favelas are getting more attention from filmmakers and the media both from brazil and abroad since local governments seem to have given up a long time ago one the other hand it's incredibly frustrating that rising turns out to be such a missed opportunity for enlightening non brazilian audiences on the issue because first time directors jeff zimbalist and matt who are from the u s and understandably on the matter turn the biography of group leader anderson into a glamorous in this superficial one sided under researched and misleading documentary good intentions muddled results rising looks like a tv ad is shallow as a prime time tv interview and biased as a promotional video br br rising feels uncomfortably phony for a brazilian viewer and not only because of its hype visual treatment of a bleak reality and its misplaced feel good happy ending city of god is an obvious reference here with cog actors and jonathan cameoing for no apparent reason other than hype rising is allegedly a documentary about the group and its leader anderson but beware when you see the scenes shot in favelas overlooking the beautiful rio shore line you might as well be warned that the home of and anderson is located in an area of rio far away from any beach strange choice of location to say the least br br rising is probably confusing for non brazilians who won't know many of the interviewees and the film won't tell them either and will have to wait for the closing credits to find out that many of the songs on the soundtrack are not by the band though you'll get suspicious when you start to hear pink martini of all people they won't know either that important issues were simply left unmentioned why does the film push the notion that is a one man project why not acknowledge the many partners who supply it with substantial financial and support like city council private brazilian corporations multinational recording companies and international without which might not even subsist why not state clearly that is still plagued by violent drug wars and that its dwellers still live in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and cops why not state clearly that many of the archive footage clips showing police violence and corruption did not take place in how and why did the kid richard finally join why on freaking earth wasn't he interviewed once again at the end of the film br br as for anderson himself the film leaves a lot of loose ends for the viewer what's the story about anderson having two mothers is the baby he holds in his arms his son why is he inspired by shiva is he a buddhist why does a woman appear on the beach when the films mentions anderson's miraculous recovery from the accident is he a follower why not let him explain the contradiction of starting a group that fights drugs and simultaneously praises bob marley if is also a pride building movement for black people from favelas why are the girls in the band limited to booty bouncing routines no you won't get any answers to these questions either br br instead the filmmakers are interested in turning anderson into a composite mix of pop star malcolm x gandhi and christ check out that last image of the statue of christ the redeemer atop hill immediately after showing anderson miraculously walking after his surgery and that's the worst thing the filmmakers could do to anderson and his cause turn him into a special chosen one by the time they show his surgery scar you're ready to believe it's a mark from god br br because what's remarkable about anderson who's the most ordinary guy you could ever meet is that he helped change his environment not by being special but by copying and adapting winning projects like the movement in among others to his own community with strong support by friends artists intellectuals politicians businessmen and the media if you're not fluent in portuguese you probably won't notice that anderson isn't particularly bright or articulate unlike his sharply witty partner josÃ© junior as much as he isn't particularly talented as a singer lyricist or musician yet his ordinariness might have been the film's true inspirational core to show that anyone with idealism perseverance and steady support can in fact contribute significantly to his or her community no need to be jesus incarnate because what really matters is the movement not the guy see haven't we had enough of personality cult br br by the end of rising you probably won't know much more about favelas than you did when you walked in you'll just have seen what some of them look like
<START> i can't give it less than a star i tried at this moment im not sure if im halfway through it or not but i stopped actively paying attention around the time part of it was revealed to be a dream or not or maybe it was i think viewers who posted a comment that didn't include the descriptions horrible or awful or made me want to swallow a bullet are probably being nice because it is an indie film don't listen to them listen to me there is no nudity in the movie skip it i needed ten lines to submit this warning so i will also say that the goth girl that some users have described as hot is fat she has fat elephant legs
<START> i enjoyed the film and the fact that it aimed rather high in dealing with some sophisticated material i saw the film in a preview screening and it wasn't ruined by any silly video boxes that spoiled the ending the performances were quite good especially andrew mccarthy in a more mature roll i also enjoyed the look of the film which gave it a mysterious air i also enjoyed some of the twists in the plot and don't want to give too much away in case other countries' video boxes don't give it all away the script was a little over the top at times but i appreciated the fact that the film makers weren't afraid to challenge the audiences with interesting and puzzling regarding the roll of faith in our world and while some might find the ending a little too open ended i appreciated the fact that the movie refused to tie everything up neatly with a bow that's not how life works
