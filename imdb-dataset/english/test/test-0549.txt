<START> so the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground his super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life one day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life unfortunately for him the god loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story if that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up br br this movie is terrible there's really no other way for me to say it and i just can't stretch it enough the only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played jamie kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching i know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap the original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling this one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable bo gross i'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer br br the cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up if there was music i didn't pay attention to it because i had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but i can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f king take if new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out br br bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
<START> while john garfield seems to get the bulk of attention the true star of four daughters is priscilla lane her performance is the glue that holds the large cast together br br her ability to interact equally well with john garfield and the more carefree jeffrey lynn is at the core of the success of four daughters
<START> i'm in a film class and i know that i don't know everything about film but truthfully this is one of the worst stupidest retarded and waste time movies that i have ever seen and i saw napolean they are both equally terrible is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the film its not really a heart warming story and pat conroy overcomes nothing i'm not saying there should be fighting and crap blowing up but it would liven up this more than bland film the kids they fond to act in this film may have been the real kids from island they sounded stupid and couldn't act as as far as i am concerned this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie i don't know why this movie was even made top five worst movies of all time
<START> this is a true gem of a tv film based on a completely untrue story it follows the course of the down and out football league club through their course in the english fa cup where mayhem ensues and the players all sport seventies styles the ending is unexpected the performances are great and nick hancock shows that he can do something other than host sports shows my only regret is that i didn't tape it
<START> i had been waiting eagerly to see this movie but when i finally got the chance i was very disappointed i had to stop half way or was it quarter way because of the poor script and directing not to mention the poor cast josh hartnett is the only one who can act and he's much more suitable to be the hero of the story br br well basically the story is just about a loose girl from the country who cheated on her long time decent boyfriend only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my sympathy not even when the writer intended to i wonder where the moral values go br br the actors are so stiff that when i resume the movie few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature they still failed to make me pay attention the spoiled couple can only disgust me what a movie br br i think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review it together so that they won't make the same mistakes next time round and next time they might consider josh hartnett as the protagonist
<START> the movie opens with beautiful landscape shots of the northwest countryside jutting out from earth a freight train crossing fields of hay in the distance billows of clouds small structures by the side of the road a motel or a diner in the middle of nowhere over this plays a languid but mysterious twin peaks piano arrangement and it's all adequately moody and atmospheric in an american gothic sort of way through this however director jon jost keeps awkward frames blocks of letters opening credits with annoying sounds color frames that announce blue numbers that count towards the 12 steps to a conclusion announced in the opening credits it's obvious by the first couple of minutes that though jost is more than capable to capture landscape and ambiance he doesn't care for it he has neither the affection for pacific northwest open expanses that terrence malick does in badlands and neither the time or inclination of twin peaks david lynch to weave mystery and intrigue around a given location br br the rest of the movie is more jon jost frustration with experimental tricks that serve their own purpose the use of split screen is interesting i like in particular how we get the first image of ricky lee split in two one is recounting childhood memories that matter only to him the other is cursing and banging his head against the wall and over the course of the movie the second ricky lee prevails the macho laid back hipster with the shades who is hopelessly self involved and stupid on the other hand the stop motion animation and choice to play most of the movie in voice over narration does not work it does at times because jost writes as good as he shoots static shots of the smalltown american nowheresville but beth ann's monologues delivered in the most flat nasal monotone imaginable a voice that sounds like stephen hawking's computer speech program crossed with a horse whinnying are so grating to the ear it kind of defeats the purpose of trying to pay attention br br each of the couple relate to us their past experiences their small triumphs and follies and doubts and past relationships that went nowhere they say very little to each other and what they say they say with blank faces but they hump like rabbits that seems to be their only channel of communication left open perhaps the only one they can trust with any safety jost clearly picks his main characters in among the naive and delusional those baited by an american dream turned sour but he doesn't place himself above them he's not condescending or smug in his portrayal they may be misguided but they are graced with moments of humanity awkward though they may be we're called to empathize and show affection rather than point and laugh this is the most successful becomes the movie's characters come alive even when their expressionless faces do not even when jost gets in their way with his stilted framing and obtrusive camera games br br then we go back to angry rants about the destructive effects of money played over an inserted shot of a dollar bill we get a weird psychedelic sequence where camera glides under big leafy trees that soon turn red as beth ann repeatedly muses about the redwood trees in the voice over we even get a sudden about turn towards plot and genre as the couple of beth ann and ricky lee smalltown losers with nowhere to go and nothing to hold them back to their dead end lives arrive in california and decide to rob a 7 11 the movie doesn't soar to an emotional crescendo in the aftermath of the botched 7 11 job such as one might expect from a on the run' road movie it slowly screeches to a halt and you look out the window to see it hasn't really got anyplace in particular parts of the ride have been hypnotic and parts almost touching and funny but everything else has been mostly annoying
<START> i too saw this film at a film festival but unlike the previous poster i found it both interesting and original in a sea of terrible features shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting a w o l however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to the outer limits the performances are solid not that one would expect otherwise from morse or mcginley and the directing is sharp and on the money i personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film i saw a w o l is quite aptly written by shane black who as is usually the case plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously all in all a w o l proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film
<START> mr uwe fail strikes again transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap poor acting poor directing awful adaptation i mean far cry game was awesome its like a true fps game cool weapons and lots lots lots of point and shoot in the movie we had nothing compared to the game well we had some of the point and shoot thing but i don't know how to explain but if you ever watched another uwe fail movie you will understand if you don't believe me go to the website petition online and do a check for one named stop uwe bowl br br that movie made my eyes bleed someone must stop him for once br br don't waste your time
<START> um okay this is very poor indeed if compared to the first film the very much so critically acclaimed rosemary's baby in fact it's a pretty poor film in general yes there are a few redeeming qualities but i'll get to that later br br well it has been quite a while since the last film took place in fact it's been pretty much eight years i believe rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and influence him in a good way rather than let him succumb to the evil future that the coven or tribe as it is referred to as here has laid out for him when she runs off with him and an empty bus comes and picks her up leaving her child with a hooker the hooker raises him until he comes of age where satan tries to possess him since he seems to be rejecting his evil heritage in every way br br obviously things don't go as planned and then there is the ending that i would have felt seriously ashamed at had i not seen it coming since hearing that there was a sequel to rosemary's baby okay when i was around 11 years old i witnessed the masterpiece rosemary's baby and then read the book sequel thinking that this film was an adaptation of that i tracked this film down and got it was i right in doing so well in some way yes i am a true fan of this franchise and can say that i have seen the sequel and i have some idea as to what happens after the events in the first film speaking of both this film and son of rosemary ira levin's own book sequel not yet adapted to film br br ruth gordon who played minnie in the first film is shown a few times in this film but why oh why is the coven so different the knife rosemary had dropped in the first film is shown sticking out of the ground yet minnie pulled it out the coven is now called the tribe as i said earlier they now go around in hooded capes chanting hail satan hail adrian hail satan hail adrian and so on and so forth the gothic building is now like a two story house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere it looks like a little nice suburb home or something and the child itself is pretty normal looking with his eyes only going all catty when he gets mad and kills someone or something in that vain br br as far as the acting goes it's pretty poor on all parts except for stephen mchattie whom plays a very grown up adrian duke astin replacing mia farrow as rosemary has to have one of the flat out worst performances ever to be caught on film it is so bad it's almost not even funny when she screams oh my god and cries for like the fifteenth time in the movie you're just like okay it's not funny anymore and then by the time she is gone and the movie has been on for twenty minutes only you're like thank the lord i don't have to hear her say oh my god any longer sheesh in the end this movie has very very very few redeeming qualities enough to get it at least four stars but if you look at it as a serious sequel to the first film it's pretty much non existent
<START> one of the few comedic twilight zones that's actually really good we have floyd the barber from andy griffith show the stock in trade old geezer dude from many old westerns and lovable old it also has that cool spacecraft interior that i believe was used in the sci fi classic forbidden planet or else the day the earth stood sill plus the new guys in town are driving an exotic renault i think sports car back in the days when european automobiles were known as foreign jobs in the u s the whole idea of harmonica as weapon is a hoot and the fact that buddies love him despite being the fact he's a total bs artist is a heartwarming moment
<START> you have got to see this movie i saw it as a 13 year old at the theater on my very first date fast forward over 20 years and i'm now gay thanks a lot one dark night lol this movie creeped the hell out of me as a kid still do but as an adult the thrill of this movie isn't in the storyline but rather the hysterical laughs it holds highlights are listening to the names the teenagers call each other from my personal favorite to turkey also keep your eyes peeled for the scene where carol the blond head sister attempts to hang her phone up on a soda can can't believe they didn't that other highlights include adam west's overly dramatic outbursts and the gooey corpses if you're a fan of true horror i'd suggest this film just because to me it's almost a parody on horror there is def a creepy factor and the plot is a good one but don't watch it if you want to be scared out of your wits unless you're like 10 years old or something
<START> this was a very disappointing movie i would definitely call this the worst movie of all time br br the acting and writing were poor and the jokes were not funny br br i don't see why on earth this piece of crap was even made i'm not a picky person and i can enjoy stupid things but this is just way too stupid and just plain awful br br avoid this wretched piece of garbage at all costs
<START> this is a difficult movie to watch and would have been even more difficult had i known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19 pixote is a street kid in sao paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement he is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesn't exist when finally he escapes he and three comrades survive by the only means they know which is crime what makes the film so heart rending is that both pixote and the actor portraying him clearly do not wish to be the characters life circumstances have made them pixote tries to trust and to love and to bond but there simply is no room in his world for the gentle side of human nature one is left at the end wanting desperately to do something for the of the world but what building more prisons with higher walls surely is not the answer
<START> cool action yeah the premise has been done but not this way that's the trick hey folks shock it's an x file br br to me it's cool that scully mulder have almost no scenes together they have to adapt rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on and each other's adaptation skills they read into each other's moves and get the job done sort of br br oh yeah really good acting do these people get paid to do this or a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them into work hey duchovny where's the day old donuts malcolm get to school
<START> i liked some of the characters but our lead relied too heavily on a charming smile i didn't care two about him he makes bad choices and i really didn't care since he did not seem to either he seemed rather unintelligent there were a couple of moments that provided a chance at some human insight the scene with the whale was interesting but these are lost in the general malaise of the film the love interest was acceptable and the other various characters were mildly interesting but the plot meanders around too much and left me wanting at many points in the film in the end i wondered why i stayed so long br br there are some tepidly humorous moments but ultimately i did not care i cannot fathom rating the film higher 3 of 10
