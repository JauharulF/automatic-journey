<START> a true geek girl's dream high tech high drama smart guys steamy sex and large explosions very large explosions sam waterston is so natural in the role of oppenheimer that tapes of the real oppenheimer sound odd apparently he had a voice similar to ronald reagan the triumph and tragedy of oppenheimer is one of the 20th century's most stirring dramas and this movie stands as a model of what docu drama ought to be the facts are allowed to speak for themselves while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record not to call attention to themselves an interesting fact some of the technical details used had only recently been declassified and so are of special interest a must see
<START> if you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable looney tunes cartoon the animation is wonderful the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too the writing is razor sharp and the sight gags especially daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed i really did love the arguments between daffy and bugs and that bugs wins every time i also love it that daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny i do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too bugs is still his charming and rascally self and elmer is funny if rather dumb too in short this is absolutely brilliant and actually my personal favourite of the hunting trilogy for sheer entertainment value 10 10 bethany cox
<START> after reading a biography on the last russian nicholas ii and his failure to secure the army's support i decided to give this film a try br br i watched it with a completely open mind not knowing anything about it except its reputation br br these are the things that impressed me the most br br 1 the shots of battleships and the soldiers used as extras more than once i stopped to think if this was done in this time and place 80 of this would have been computer generated br br 2 the realism in it from the maggot infested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend killed for a bowl of soup this movie makes no concessions to the pc cause which thankfully hadn't been invented yet br br 3 the slow descent into madness of the odessa steps sequence from the first shot when the limbless man appears you get the idea something might be wrong since the overall shots are composed though you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings then an amputee appears and people start falling in dramatic poses still the shots are composed until the appear into scene and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear this scene is easily worth the price of admission br br 4 the fact that this movie is 100 unadulterated propaganda then again when rambo fought in afghanistan he also was having something to do with propaganda only a different kind br br overall a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative nevertheless metropolis the cabinet of dr caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today they really make modern movies look boring and repetitive
<START> the 70s were without a doubt the golden age of made for tv horror this is one of those that was probably churned out as an abc movie of the week it's the old story of a house and or ghost possessing one of the new owners the movie has promise but it's never realized everything is rushed too much tension and suspense need time to build and grow and there's nothing new we've seen it all before and one better br br one final thought i don't understand why robert wagner's character would fall for the long dead movie star when he's married to kate jackson for goodness sake
<START> i saw this film on september 1st 2005 in indianapolis i am one of the judges for the heartland film festival that screens films for their truly moving picture award a truly moving picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life heartland gave that award to this film br br this is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century at that time it was the game of upper class and rich gentlemen and working people could only participate by being at country clubs with this backdrop this based on a true story unfolds with a young working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world harry br br and the story is inspirational against all odds francis played by shia labeouf of holes gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the u s and great britain at the 1913 u s open francis is ill prepared and has a child for a caddy the caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in but despite these handicaps francis displays courage spirit heroism and humility at this world class event br br and we learn a lot about the early years of golf for example the use of small wooden clubs the layout of the short holes the manual the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths the terrible conditions of the greens and and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain br br this film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing and with no big movie stars the story is somehow more believable br br this adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of miracle and remember the titans br br fyi there is a truly moving pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years
<START> the first review i saw of this on imdb says that vince vaughn is a much better actor than anthony perkins was in this role makes me wonder if he saw the original it's tough to review psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960 you have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy but makes you feel for him add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s br br where does this film go wrong let's start with casting anne heche is fine as a vivian crane but as norman bates vince vaughn is all wrong for one thing he looks far too young secondly he has no idea how to play the roll his nervous laugh reminds me of ron howard trying to play a tough guy on happy days everything he does screams i did it the original movie even to those who know everything about it still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on norman and turns her into a real separate character how about the shower scene when i finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen i was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me bernard score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward scaring you than danny elfman's synth interpretations during the scene this shower scene merely serves to show us anne naked body and some nice color blood which brings us to the choice to film in color didn't work br br there is something about remaking classic films that hardly ever seems to work some may see this as a noble experiment but honestly if gus van sant had nothing to add to this film he should have left it alone
<START> shakespeare would have been outraged the writers mutilated shakespeare's amazing work ariel is the only believable acting performance the african voodoo secluded swamp and gator man character make the movie a mockery of shakespeare's true tempest br br don't waste your eye sight on this movie
<START> perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of jane austen's works has been portrayed perhaps i am too severe on this adaptation but i'm afraid i am biased to the a e version i have a hard time imagining mr darcy portrayed by anyone other than colin firth br br the characters seemed shallow and often dialogue forced lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book her fancy for was overplayed and then her sudden like for darcy was not believable br br darcy was portrayed tolerably well i will grant him he managed to maintain the aloofness that is required but i felt he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that makes his character so delightful especially in the proposal scene br br mr and mrs bennet were also played well but seemed lacking in many ways the mean temper of mrs bennet was not completely captured in her performance br br mr collins' was a good portrayal very much in line with the book br br i will refrain from commenting on lady catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst portrayal in the entire film br br other problems i saw were the few liberties they took with the order of events such as darcy being present at the first meeting with lady c and also that miss lucas and sir william did not join lizzy on her visit to the collins' br br the choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes the scene where lizzy and darcy dance loses much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look akward on the ballroom floor at least this bbc version left out the dialogue between lizzy darcy and sir william when he commends the two on their dancing as they performed very ill indeed br br there were occasional moments that it kept me interested but overall i find this version to be a disappointment i would not advise this film unless you're like me and you are excessively diverted by such follies br br
<START> the first time i saw this film i was a kid i was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters i saw it on network tv i remember watching it crying afterward it was only the second film to illicit that response rocky was the first and there haven't been many since i can't say why exactly larry rain murphy didn't deserve to win any more that rocky balboa or anyone else i know i admired murphy not so much for what he did but for the way he did his time stoic he didn't need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity he ran because he could he needed no other reason i have a rule today that when i see this film late at night on cable television the only time most will come across it i must watch no matter what i have to do the next morning fortunately it doesn't play often like shawshank redemption or other favorites so i still get plenty of sleep and i never tire of the story of one man's unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory
<START> i watched this movie on hbo and i had a good time br br the director has done a great work i found myself totally absorbed into this movie once it started norman performance is cool i expect more chilling movies from him br br i was so absorbed that on occasions i wanted to grab gun from norman and shoot that snake girl hehe i like the movies when innocent looking girls play tricks with men really cunningly the ending was what i wanted br br this movie is filled with twists of moments you expect this but something else happens br br in the beginning those massive images cut scenes were really painful to eyes br br although it was not shown when norman reedus changed currency notes or is it me standing by fridge
<START> tous feels like the granddaddy of the sopranos in mixing the criminal and the domestic and of the buddy film to feel as contemporary as reservoir dogs br br even as these gangsters are affectionately entangled with wives children lovers and parents they are coldly ruthless and we are constantly reminded they are no matter what warm situation we also see them in they can tousle a kid's hair and then shoot a threat in cold blood the key is loyalty and the male camaraderie is beautifully conveyed without ethnic or class stereotypes even as their web of past obligations and pay backs narrows into suspicion and paranoia as the old gang is in various stages of parole retirement out on bail or into new less profitable ventures an intense accusation is of sending a stranger to perform an old escape scenario it is a high point of emotion when a wife is told off that she's not the one the gangster is friends with while virtually the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he recalls his wife br br in italy and france are marvelously used in blinding daylight to dark water and highways from the opening set up of a pair of brazen robbers who are traveling with one's wife and two kids rugged craggy lino ventura captures the screen immediately as the criminal dad and the second thug is clearly a casually avuncular presence in their lives as they smoothly coordinate the theft and escape in cars buses on boats and motorcycles in easy tandem this is not the clichÃ© crusty old guy softened with the big eyed orphan these are their jobs and their families and they intersect in horrific ways br br the film pulls no punches in unexpectedly killing off characters directly and as collateral damage and challenging our sympathy for them right through to the unsentimental end which is probably why there was never an american remake br br it seems so fresh that it's not until jean paul belmondo enters almost a third of the way into the film looking so as a young punk that one realizes that this is from 1960 sultry sandra milo has smart and terrific chemistry with him from an ambulance to an elevator to a hospital bed br br while the film forum was showing a new 35 mm print with newly translated subtitles it was not pristine the program notes explained that the title refers to a kind of insurance policy and is pun on tourist class
<START> with nbc's thank god you're here the network may be trying to replicate the successes of abc's improv sitcom who's line is it anyway in which host drew carey would judge the performances of a handful of cast regulars asked to improvise scenes of some kind in the nbc show dave foley and co host dave alan grier oversee a handful of notable comedians who must improvise their way through various scenes which all begin with thank god you're here it takes itself far too seriously why must viewers be repeatedly reminded that the actors have never seen the sets before both co hosts seem less then enthused after watching the continuously sub par unfunny attempts by the actors to some laughs i am left wondering whether the live audience is genuinely laughing at what transpires or whether they too are improvising expect this time slot filler to be a very short lived one
<START> as a scuba diver i can appreciate the incredible physical strain the cameramen must have endured to get the shots underwater this series is much more than that though the narration is perfect the scenes bordering on implausible and the subject matter enthralling the day to day struggle for life taking place out of the view of we terrestrial dwellers is mind boggling this dvd set has open my eyes to another planet right here on earth i urge everyone to watch this series
<START> mr bean has always been my favorite no matte how many times you watch the same thing the show never gets monotonous or repetitive mr bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh his gestures his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch the situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater there is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are 1 when mr bean at a hotel 2 the one where he watches the scary film 3 mind the baby the diaper scene especially in fact all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show mr bean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny including completely stripping himself in one of the episodes the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing 10 out of 10
<START> i've heard people compare this movie to sideways how this comparison was made i'll never guess because this movie was in no way comparable to sideways br br these 2 films were as different as star wars and the the only thing they had in common at all was they both had wine as a subject br br though the interviews in this documentary were semi interesting they were ruined by the absolute worst camera work ever attempted i've never seen worse camera work in my life and i'm comparing it to home videos accidentally taken by 5 year olds br br i give this two stars only for the interesting interviews with french wine types and for showing how pushy and corrupt the american wine companies are aren't all companies pushy and corrupt i'd give it 10 stars yes that's negative 10 for the deplorable terrible horrible awful vertigo inducing 5 year old could do better camera mess
