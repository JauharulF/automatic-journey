<START> okay enough every time i think i've seen a film that is so misbegotten so bad in every way that i think that no one could possibly find something to praise i just come to the imdb where i'm greeted with the usual inane undiscovered masterpiece great film i mean honestly what movie are you people watching because it's certainly not the mess i just watched on the new fox mgm ua dvd there are about three amusing lines and a plot that gives incoherence a new meaning and then after ninety three interminable minutes it just stops and the end credits begin then there's another scene the dvd is fairly wretched which suits the film the source material is almost completely faded to an ugly brown it's hard to imagine this film followed get carter the critics and the public got this one right back then it was lambasted and a box office disaster and rightfully so but you pundits keep on trying and i'll keep on trying to find a movie that doesn't have someone who raves about it
<START> there's hell to pay when you cross nami female scorpion and a dangerous group of thugs including their sadistic head pimp and his equally repellent lady operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist does just that hell hath no fury like scorpion and a determined detective seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after her will do whatever it takes and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts to catch nami nami finds an ally in hooker yuki watanabe who provides her a temporary shelter yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job and must take care of him in a disturbing revelation regarding incest she also provides his sexual needs she in actuality keeps him locked up in a room while working the streets meanwhile nami is targeted by a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her own she works as a sewer and he threatens to turn her into the authorities nami was an escaped convict who fled a subway from the cops if she doesn't supply him sexual favors his wife dumps a tea kettle of boiling water all over his face and body resulting in death the prostitution clan come looking for nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization that's when katsu lee the pimp's lover and confidant realizes that the one responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former inmate of hers scorpion subduing her with an injected liquid drug placing her in a bird cage katsu embellishes in her imprisonment what ultimately fuels rage is watching a prostitute die outside her cell a victim of a forced late term abortion left to bleed to death finding a scalpel in her hand from the operation room nami will break free from the cage and prey upon each member of the clan responsible for the hooker's death the series of scalpel murders provide with an opportunity to catch nami and he'll trap her in the underground sewers below the city but can he catch or kill her especially if yuki comes to her aid br br trust me when i say there was no shackles binding director ito or his film making team because female prisoner scorpion beast stable is yet another perverse deranged and ultra violent entry in the very entertaining series equipped with fine production values and a visually stylistic talent for capturing all of the madness in imaginative ways ito pulls you right or he did me into the twisted drama that always exists when nami is on screen when you have a protracted opening credits sequence where your anti heroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a man's severed arm handcuffed to her the viewer has to know what they're in for the incestuous sub plot is simply bizarre and it's shot in a soft core way with the retarded brother humping his numb cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead and the entire abortion sequence is rather hard to sit through but the abortion angle as disturbing as it is provides motivation for revenge despite imperfect ways and her criminal nature you would rather see her take these cretins out than vice versa interesting angle with detective as well is willing to break the rules and he becomes a force of nature towards anyone who stands in his way of capturing his mortal enemy his fate at the end visiting another enemy of in an isolated cell while she looks on perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous yet so entertaining the scalpel murders is a montage of slumping scumbags in various places the blades protruding from flesh with nami leaving the crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan out in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances while the film is essentially a comic book adventure there's a sadness that permeates and few characters come away without flaws i imagine many will walk away from this scoffing at how unrealistic female prisoner scorpion beast stable is specifically how nami is able to escape capture time and time again accomplishing her goals of revenge paying back all those who have wronged her but i looked at it as a violent action cartoon much like the later 80's films and enjoyed it for what it was as always this film features some beautiful asian actresses and some colorful heavies almost always reserved quiet yet chilly staring down her enemies with violent intent is in fine form in more ways than one and lee as her cross eyed repugnant adversary runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized abusive foe worthy of psychological torment when both are in prison ways of torturing her are sweet my favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot but is so wonderfully wrong features a dog discovering rotted severed arm walking through a street eventually finding a resting place to chew on it
<START> code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person the haves and the have nots live in completely separate territories the powers that be can remove your memories etc we've seen this stuff before but that's ok no movie is 100 original this kind of premise is always fun to contemplate unfortunately just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching code 46 the characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting maybe that's commentary on a dehumanized future but it's still dull to watch it's sloooow br br at times the imagery is nice but usually coupled with its evocative soundtrack just looks like a glorified perfume commercial code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera work that i find annoying you know two characters talk as the camera artlessly floats on one side two seconds later it's floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention br br my friends liked this movie if they tried to get me to watch it again i probably would not do so unless they agreed to pay me 50
<START> there are only a few movies which can be called must see' and is one of those films in many ways it was ahead of it's time and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better known films copied by many equaled by none this truly is one great movie br br the story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity the story takes place in a post apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns c thomas howell is a one who protects the populace for various religious leaders by killing off any unfit members of the society the whole idea made me think about our society it's really a brilliant social commentary which is more than i can say for certain recent sci fi action blockbusters matrix reloaded and revolutions didn't make one feel that any real innovation was taking place just dull video game effects but shepherd scores on the action scale too br br not once does this movie let the viewer catch their breath peter hayman proves himself to be one of the few genius action directors we're talking 100 high grade down home kung fu fighting it was excellent really good special effects shoot outs bleak futuristic cyber punk noir the film really has its own elements br br when talking about shepherd it's impossible not to mention how much style it has the vision of this city is really stunning it recalls images of tim burton's very memorable vision of gotham in batman and these sights are photographed by mears with a degree of skill that puts gordon willis and conrad hall to shame even the special effects proved amazing doubtless the scenes where fighting occurs are landmarks in all of filmmaking this movie is a ballet of awesome visual display br br still at the base of it all there lies an interesting story carried through by a strong cast the acting especially rowdy piper and the plot are both great and excellently directed in contrast with loads of futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and full of wit i'm always proud to see a great film like shepherd come along it's a damn shame that it didn't receive good distribution and made nothing in the box office it's a rarity worth searching for this movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler for having seen it
<START> this thing it shouldn't be called a film is almost worse than manos but you just have to see it it's hilarious if you see it at video store rent it if you see the 10th anniversary edition yes there is a special edition for under 10 buy it if your friend has it borrow it you just have to see this the acting is so bad and the gore is is so fake after viewing this you'll be asking yourself why did they make this insult of the art of film that's assuming your face doesn't melt off like the in raiders if you manage to see this be sure to vote this movie as 1 awful so it can make the bottom 100 it really deserves a spot there i'm surprised it's not number 1 right now
<START> i enjoyed this programme immensely it is exceptionally well written with finely judged performances and clever visuals br br it is also very frank and honest refreshing compared to the sanitised representation of drug use in films and television br br unmissable one of the finest television shows of recent years and triumph on all scales for channel 4 br br 9 10
<START> this self important confusing b w film watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip you're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away on its own down the storm drain there's no room for plot when you've got visceral imagery and subtle allegory to me it seems like the director tries to make the next great art movie while begging for intellectual accolades i didn't bring my beret either watching this i felt almost insulted since the film does such an effective job of distancing itself from you
<START> a thinly veiled attempt to push to the film going non wrestling fan what could be worse than hogan in the movies bad actors in the wrestling ring and this film produced both as tiny lester made his way to the wwe that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders see the dictionary under oops as a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when i came out i immediately checked into h a hulkamaniacs i am proud to say i have been off the hulk for 17 years now and have never had a craving since since this was made to bring in more fans to the juggernaut that was the wwe in hey day one has to wonder if there weren't more fans like me who turned to other past times that did not poison ones mind like this offense to celluloid did such as huffing gas or russian roulette
<START> richard donner shows off his liberal credentials with this ludicrously overcooked simplistic attack on the politics of south africa it's not as if america is the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love and further irony is added by the fact that the movie is set in the city that was the home of rodney king and glorifies the police department that did so much towards community relations with their brutal racist behaviour so donner's salt and pepper pairing who clearly have a late developing teenage crush on one another do their own thing with fine disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one worries because the bad guys are white south africans surely a worrying example of police racism in itself inside rudd's joss ackland eminently office the decor is designed and lit to resemble as far as possible the and just in case some rather dumb moviegoers miss the point he and his men are referred to as nazis at regular intervals for me the only bright spot in the movie was when mel gibson turned up at an anti apartheid demonstration carrying a banner bearing the inscription end aparthied now the intensely irritating joe pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the boys' shoulders by following them around yapping incessantly like a badly trained puppy this would be bearable if there was the remotest possibility of him ending up in a concrete overcoat but sadly he survives to irritate another day miss patsy kensit seems in a world of her own perhaps not believing her luck at being cast opposite mel gibson who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home which appears to have been washed up on a beach somewhere shortly after their affair they come under fire from a number of helicopters that fire enough rounds into mel's caravan to keep the u s army in iraq going for six months fortunately he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause coitus just as they are going for seconds and his barking warns them of the imminent attack i hope he got a special bone as a reward the film climaxes without interruption from mel's dog on a cargo ship bound for nazi germany sorry south africa when mel and danny murder so many members of the master race that i lost count despite jiggling around like bonnie and clyde under the impact of a hail of bullets mel survives curled up in his partner's arms like a small child with a wise and benevolent father take that apartheid
<START> i've seen the previews everywhere before deciding to watch it and what do you know i actually liked it it has a new twist of the 18th century england although the music in the dance scene were obviously modernized and also the colors of liv tyler's although it is pretty it fit quite perfectly br br if you just want a good time you should check this out very different from other 18th century detailed films
<START> jumpin' this movie stinks it's a dull and listless drag that never lets up it's a wonder anyone even bothered to make groucho up in his bizarre trademark eyebrows and mustache as he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say throughout this bore chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his italian accent br br only harpo provides a grin or two and there's precious little of that to go around here anyway figure in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another obnoxious co comic in frank albertson and the road gets even br br a real misfire
<START> this is a fantastic film the acting is some of the best i've seen is obviously very beautiful and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting the the cinematography was extremely ahead of its time watching it i could see parallels of cinematography used today this is truly a groundbreaking film because of the cinematography and acting the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes it's a very touching and powerful piece my friend told me it was must see and i definitely agree with her this is one of those films that you watch and never forget everyone should see this intensely moving film this should be put on everyone's movies to see before whatever list
<START> my wife and i saw this in the theater when it first came out br br there were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time br br this is the only movie i have ever walked out on br br it was just painful to sit through br br the theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund br br never had that happen before or since do not rent this you will really regret it i am really by the vote summary perhaps personal has something to do with it
<START> i really enjoyed this film i'm not usually one for fairy tales or make believe but this film captured my attention br br i first saw this film on the uk channel hallmark which usually shows afew tacky films but then snow queen came along and i was loving it i really really admire bridget fonda in this movie she plays the snow queen brilliantly and glamorously br br i won't explain what the story is about as other people have already done so so there is no point repeating br br i would just suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairy tale journey get this film but if you want to purchase it and you live in the uk you might have a hard time i've bought it from south korea brand new english edition of course
<START> when one watches romantic comedies one knows what to expect we've seen enough of them over many many years to know how they go there's a formula one which almost always begets movies that become popular with the genre's audience not always in relation to their actual quality how to play around with that and create something more interesting this movie has a suggestion and it works relatively well instead of simply following a lead we follow him skillfully helping the unfortunate men those who lack the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities that they possess to the women they are in love with the plot follows smith as he works on his self proclaimed most difficult such case kevin james alongside his aid of james we also follow mendes who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want one particular scene that inspires great respect of smith's character is him meeting one such jerk and putting him in his place after seeing smith helping the disaster that is james we see him with mendes and in spite of his talent for helping others he messes up badly with her making a marvelous point about love and how falling in love affects us for a romantic comedy this mostly avoids the pitfalls of such at times almost bordering on feeling like a spoof of the genre though the last few scenes has the sweetness and the emotions of this type of films whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review the pace is quite good it never really slows down and seldom moves too fast the acting is great as far as pretty much everyone goes the characters are nicely developed and come off as real people the humor doesn't always work there are occasional gags that are less than fortunately executed and one or two jokes that seem forced however for the most part the film was funny i recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or have been in love those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes 7 10
