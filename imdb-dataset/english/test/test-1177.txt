<START> casper van dien what can i say i enjoy the guy his movies bring a certain flair to them that is actually not brought on by the director or producer but by him recycled plots check rip offs of better movies check wooden acting check it's not that van dien is a bad actor he has been effective in hollywood gloss as starship troopers and sleepy hollow he just really has not been offered a script worthy of his talents and yes he does have acting talent other than being eye candy this movie offers a slight hint of what van dien can offer but is bogged down by the production of it all the script can be better developed see oliver stone's u turn the directing can be better utilized see robert from dusk til dawn the dp could've made the desert more exotic see russ meyer's faster pussycat faster kill this script is weak because this is something we have seen before many other times so the double triple crosses are expected the direction is weak because it is not offering anything new and telegraphs many of the weak script moments the cinematography at times paints a lovely autumn desert flavor to it but at other times it doesn't take advantage of the scorching light and the beginning sequence is horrible in blue br br now to the acting van dien shows some grace and charisma to his jake he neither gets too methodical nor too campy in his role a nice balance especially since the rest of the cast seems too distracted as to how they should be acting in this film bad script or bad direction you make your opinion the only other person worth mentioning is bryan brown's villain as it provides the only real credit for acting in this film aspiring actors forget trying to learn how to act in green screen try learning how to act in a horrendous script and take notes on bryan brown in this film he adds extra depth to his role and is a nice counter part to van character jake always seem to either be one step ahead or control of any situation whether if it is out of his control the femme fatale is weak this is a desert noir after all and is another nail in this film's coffin you decide script or direction the character should've been thrusted forward in the movie instead of being pushed into the back ground later on to make room for the real femme fatale so watch the film for van dien and brown and for fun try to skip a rock across the plot holes laced within the film
<START> the plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the african jungle plains its a turkey and the some what it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent to the release footage of men on a safari there are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit south seas natives at sea used to represent people in the middle of africa women in bikini's horrible narration and a guy in a loin cloth with make up all over his body racially insensitive i think so this is a movie to sit and make fun of but only with lots of alcoholic drinks and witty friends at any other time this is going to be a chore to get through its a bad bad bad movie beyond that i'm speechless
<START> one type of western i greatly enjoy is when the apparently weak which is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the strong finally decides there is no other way there is a great moment in this film when john parrish glenn ford goes into the saloon and decides to stand up to the gunfighter wade matlock it is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud in my opinion the violent men is a great western i would rank it among the best it makes great use of the wide screen a spectacular scenery of the mountains the women have a crucial part caroline may is engaged to parrish but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east she wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price martha barbara stanwick is tired of helping her crippled husband lee edward g robinson but she will do anything to have an always bigger ranch and more power meanwhile she is betraying her husband with his brother brian keith her daughter judith diane foster is seeing all that happens but feeling impotent to react because she does not want to hurt her father parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the anchor ranch like he had warned lee don't make me fight because you won't like my way of fighting
<START> the death of a performer at a broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime solving duo the dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic but also a prime suspect in this death and some other murders that occur at the theatre 'the phantom killer' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim so it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br milton screenplay puts a little spark in this low budget mystery whodunit helpfully dave o'brien as anthony tony woolrich does well in the lead role his skills as an actor appear to be much greater than the productions employing him o'brien and cab driving sidekick frank jenks as egbert romeo would have made a fine 1950s tv detective team leading lady kay aldridge as claudia moore and the supporting cast are also good unfortunately the story becomes meandering and anti climactic br br the phantom of 42nd street 5 2 45 albert herman dave o'brien kay aldridge frank jenks
<START> 'a comedy of biblical proportions ' those masters of hyperbole the movie tag line writers at it again the sequel to 2003's bruce almighty raises barely a chuckle the only thing which raises my interest in this movie above total indifference is its dogmatic christian undertones sorry make that overtones br br steve carrel ignoring jim carrey's good sense to decline a role plays evan baxter the smug news anchor from bruce almighty who has just been elected to congress with a new life in virginia and the stress of moving into a house the size of the acropolis the pressure of all the change takes its toll on his family his wife lauren graham evidently airlifted in from stepford and three sons jimmy bennett graham phillips and johnny simmons who do a stilted job of looking sad to a piano accompaniment pray for the family to become closer and almost out of guilt so does evan br br in what must be the greatest shock of all time god morgan freeman actually shows up but does the whole pesky 'working in mysterious thing all over the place by telling evan to build a noah esquire ark in preparation for a great flood instead of just giving him a pool table or and x box or something and in true mischievous deity style he also forces evan to grow a beard long hair and wear worn and tatty robes now back in the day i'm sure razors were hard to come by so the beard was somewhat of an inevitability for noah but i'm almost certain it had nothing to do with spirituality same with the robes a massive construction job is surely made all the more difficult by such impractical clothing couldn't god have conjured up a pair of steel toed boots and a hard hat for the poor guy apparently not br br to paraphrase bill hicks i find the idea that god is messing with us somewhat unsettling and so does evan who fights him every step of the way and who wouldn't god essentially gets him fired drives away his loved ones makes him a laughing stock and at one point actually threatens him of course god turns out to be right and the rational hard working family man who was getting on fine by himself is forced to eat a large slice of bittersweet humble pie it's almost as if to be left alone by god evan had to tolerate and humour him what kind of message is that br br evan almighty does have a highly commendable environmental slant with the underlying theme being that the federal government is blind to the damage being done to the world around us it is also the first film ever to offset its carbon and this should surely be considered a landmark achievement by a hollywood studio were it not for the trite condescending banner of american christianity flying high above it evan almighty could have been an inoffensive family movie with a praiseworthy environmental record but with its confused religious dogma and relentless 'blind message it ranks as one of the most repugnant movies of all time
<START> this series is formulaic and boring the episodes are the same thing every week simply with slightly varied settings some purely evil character does some dastardly deed walker goes after him and it ends in a karate match the villains are super clichÃ© super stereotypical evil villains the good guys are all pure honest and saintly and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic after about 2 episodes the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans certainly not norris's best work his other work may be clichÃ© but it usually does not drag on for weeks if you enjoy formulaic boring repetitive clichÃ©d snooze fests then this is for you
<START> hmmm not a patch on the original from shaw brothers the fighting is average and looks very clunky the story line is as to be expected from a 70's kung fu film confusing and daft stupid voices for women dubbed in posh english accents for men i turned this off early and i love martial arts flicks get the original its so much better than this average movie don't be fooled i bought the wrong flick what i wanted was the shaw brothers movie i have just started commenting i'm only doing foreign and martial arts films this is just the beginning of my movie collection i personally own most modern martial arts flicks hope you don't waste time watching this one its for die hard fans of 70's kung fu only
<START> i go to blockbuster pick out a random movie got this and yeah br br this was a good sexual porno the quality kind of sucked and it kind of gave me a damn headache to me this movie was good for its sexual things but not as much for the horror and suspense it was magical br br the suspense not as good as i would have expected i wanted to be at the edge of my seat hoping to jump up in fear but instead i lay down on the couch and didn't see much br br the quality not really good at all i mean if you pay close attention during when the people are on the cold mountains their barely wearing anything it doesn't make much sense too br br so if your looking for a crap not really suspenseful and a pretty much sexual movie you've got this
<START> so unfortunately me and my mate watched this it was showing on a sky channel over here called zone horror which basically shows crappy b movie horror films 24 7 it was a boring friday night so decided to have a laugh and give this one a look apart from the atrocious acting the awful plot the dire effects the shoddy camera work and the brain numbing ridiculousness of it all it was ok lol in all seriousness it was quite a laugh picking holes in it and laughing at the goofy actors there is a bit of semi nudity which perked the movie up a bit unfortunately it was the who got topless as my mate calls her od if you're bored one evening and this happens to be playing take a chance you just might like it

<START> this is another good western which i enjoyed it's not an epic or anything but it is good for what it is it' about 3 fur led by a men named jed who is crude and uncivilized jed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and indian band who resent the americans on their land and want to take it back that's the gist of the story what follows is action excitement even a bit of humour and forbidden romance one of jed's friends gus reminded me a lot of the character quint played by robert shaw in the movie jaws they both have that crusty gruff demeanor anyway if you're a western fan you should find lots to like about this particular entry i think it deserves a 7 10
<START> beautiful coming of age romance about an english boy and french girl who run off and grow up br br i saw this movie as a teenager and loved it i saw it again this year and loved again br br
<START> william shakespeare's the merchant of venice is about a jewish and his bond to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant antonio the of a debt the jewish of course is shylock and he is given such a towering performance by al pacino that even outstanding actors like jeremy irons joseph fiennes and lynne collins fade into the background the film is set in 16th century venice and director michael radford relies on setting mood and realism to tell its story rejecting lavish period costumes or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audience br br radford slices the play's three hour length to a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background in the opening narration he tells us how jews came to england were subject to increasing persecution and eventually expelled from england they were forbidden to own property could make profits only by lending money at interest and were forced to live in a venetian a forerunner of darker events to come in the film the merchant antonio jeremy irons spits upon shylock in public yet feels no shame in going to the usurer to borrow 3000 to help his friend and suggested lover joseph fiennes to properly court lynne collins a wealthy heiress though shylock has been insulted by antonio he agrees to loan the money without interest for three months on the condition that of the bond grants him the right to exact a pound of flesh from antonio's heart br br the play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge but like many of shakespeare's works there are touches of broad comedy as well here the comedy involves three pairs of lovers and friend and and lorenzo another friend of and jessica daughter has offered herself to the person who can pick the right treasure from one of three boxes made of gold silver and lead the prince of morocco chooses the one of gold the prince of aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed however loves her for herself and opens the leaden casket to find the portrait within adaptation conveys a remarkable feeling for time and place residence at belmont suggests one of those splendid summer homes complete with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in every room and contrasts well with the grungy look of city with its dank alleyways br br when it becomes clear that antonio cannot repay the debt returns to venice leaving behind when he arrives the loan is in default and shylock is demanding his pound of flesh even when backed by wealth offers many times the amount in shylock is intent on revenge not only for the loss of the money but for a lifetime of outsider status the duke who sits in judgment will not intervene as enters in the guise as a lawyer to defend antonio it is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to achieve a final resolution br br the merchant of venice is not only about an unpaid debt but also about the estrangement of jews from christian society and their desire for belonging it has been one of shakespeare's most controversial plays and analysts have debated for a long time whether it is an anti semitic play or simply a play about anti semitism that reflects the prevalent view of christian society in elizabethan england although shylock is definitely a caricature he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that shakespeare views his flaws as human failings not jewish ones the duke recognizes that he is simply a man who has failed to adhere to the compassionate language of the torah br br in the monologue i am a jew hath not a jew eyes Âif you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not revenge shylock shows a universal humanity expressing the equality of all men though we are horrified at the sentence he wishes to carry out we can feel his pain accumulated over the years pacino's performance brings new vigor to the text and his often over the top persona is replaced with a gentler more understated demeanor that brings understanding to his cause during a toronto international film festival interview last september radford said about pacino you work with a brilliant actor you have a great machine it's a bit like driving a powerful car you have to dare to do it he has dared and we are all the beneficiaries
<START> rarely does one find a movie so bad that it achieves the often sought paradigm of having so little redeeming value that that alone makes it worth watching cyclone i am happy to report is such a film br br i knew i was in for something good as soon as i found the videotape i am at least its fourth owner it has a used movie sale 9 95 sticker on the front and a yard sale sticker for one dollar i picked it up at a thrift store for fifty cents br br the used movie sale sticker covers much of the front cover artwork meaning that what i see is a truly odd blended still of the front of the cyclone super bike a car flipping over on fire and heather thomas wearing eighties hair with her mouth open in an expression that says i a ache i saw that and thought all right the case honestly was enough with nowhere to turn and no one to trust teri is plunged headlong into a maze of danger and deceit but i surprised myself by actually getting around to watching it i always make time for the really bad films that fight club tape can wait br br meet teri teri is a stunningly well crafted character as we can tell from her introduction in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and later her then teri goes off to hook up with her boyfriend for the evening that goes horribly wrong before she knows it teri is driven straight into a web of deadly double crosses in cyclone the vhs box tells it like it is br br left out of the box summary perhaps out of some faint hope that actual copies of this film would be sold is how awful the acting is it might have been just me but i kept thinking i could read the characters' thoughts through their eyes this is dumb thinks heather thomas i know thinks bad guy with too wide mouth br br a driving force no pun intended for the second half of this epic picture are the car chases those were actually pretty good although i'm inclined that gasoline doesn't need coaching on how to explode what really impressed me is that in all the chases the streets were pretty much empty it's like there are only twenty people in this huge city br br i know what you're thinking you're thinking gee i have to see this movie the sad thing though is that you can't find it oh no cyclone is a film that finds you just wait some day perhaps during lunch perhaps late in the evening perhaps when military scientist jeffery combs 're is murdered by hired assassins you will hear the rustle of and know that it is time
<START> roger spottiswoode isn't the worst director and he did a good job on the underrated sci fi thriller the sixth day a k a the box office downfall of mr schwarzenegger however air america has to be one of his most inept projects br br it comes across as an amalgamation between drama comedy and war film it's not a very convincing mix in fact i found it to be overbearing br br robert downey jr during his heyday stars as a pilot recruited into a top secret cia organization operating during in the vietnam era mel gibson plays his co pilot and he stumbles upon the knowledge that they're trafficking drugs and what not br br the movie was hyped on release because it starred two famous faces and had re recorded the doors classic love me two times for the soundtrack br br the redo of the song is pretty poor which suits the film
