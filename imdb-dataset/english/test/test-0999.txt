<START> this is one of those movies where the acting set location direction and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies a keg of beer sit down and watch it to borrow from the late douglas adams watching this movie will be like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick br br what is wrong everything british actors posing as americans there have been many that can pull it off like bob hoskins but he isn't in this one it wasn't even necessary to choose north america as a location why not say it took place in england or something the director seemed to like taking shots of girls tits and asses more than actually coming up with some kind of character motivation so at this point you drunken buddies will be saying all right another t a shot there isn't much dialog so feel free to skip off to the kitchen and make those sandwiches what did i like about this movie after my friends passed out i managed to collect 185 off of them and told them they spent it at the strip bar after we finished watching the awful movie
<START> well someone who enjoys traveling down the highway at eating mcdonalds and running the air conditioner twenty four seven and watching fox news non stop i found this documentary interesting one thing i picked up when they being they talk about north america i assume this documentary was au for the canadian bashing i will leave that to bill o'reilly br br the consequence of the depletion of oil will affect everyone especially those who live in big countries of australia canada and the united states i am sure that green peace are cheering no more gas means no more suvs without realizing people who live in the sub zero temperatures could starve to death br br as someone who has studied economics i know for a fact we are living in a world of finite resources i will give the documentary props for trying to present a balanced point of view about the depletion of oil however i am studying a degree in journalism this documentary is full of loaded messages republican as what the democrats didn't send troops to vietnam br br if you are going to present a documentary about economics and resources it is best to leave the political bashing to one side because it could cause a potential audience member to totally shut down concentrate on the issue of finite resources at the end of the day it is best to open the minds of the mainstream as it is no good preaching to the minuscule choir br br i really do enjoy watching documentaries such as fahrenheit 911 and end of suburbia not for their political bias because they do remind us the world isn't so safe sure i like to shop and consumer junk food like there is no tomorrow but if the world is going to end tomorrow i would rather die rich and consume the living beep out of it br br for the potential documentary makers out there just give the people facts and let the viewers make up their own minds if you are trying package your political views as a balanced documentary the people are going to smell a rat a mile away
<START> dr is a mad scientist who is experimenting trying to find a cure for a viral cause of when he attends a piano concert he is stricken by the beautiful daughter of the pianist and sets out to woo her but when she wants nothing to do with him he infects her father with the virus in an attempt to extort money and his daughter in exchange for a cure br br that is the basic premise for this b grade low budget thriller i have to say i was underwhelmed by this movie not that it was terrible it wasn't but there was nothing particularly noteworthy about it either it was entertaining enough for a viewing but is not one that will stay in my memory br br the dialog is a bit corny at times and the acting is just mediocre the story is fairly predictable and doesn't really give us anything new of course i can't complain too much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla suit who serves almost no real purpose and a doctor with a svengali like stare that fails to mesmerize his victims br br it may be worth a watch if you like this sort of movie but don't go into it with too many expectations
<START> i have watched this movie on and off since it started playing about 1 hour ago and i have to say thats an hour of my life i wasted and will not be getting back the acting is crap and the scripts need a serious look at and whoever wrote them needs to be slapped perhaps the tv will explode and put me out of my misery the only good thing about this movie is that for guys and girls it has some good eye candy in it though most of which i wish would disappear as far as the movie is concerned the special effects as sh t dante who thinks a guy dressed in skin tight leather pants and half a leather jacket is scary he looks more feminine than most of the women in this movie the voice of dante is pathetic nobody finds it threatening or scary at all please tv i beg you to blow up
<START> as with many of wong's films a lot of people find them to be boring and confusing well i like them and i like this film too i went out and rented it on dvd and i watched it 3 times it is a very subtle movie that provides an intoxicating experience for those who did not enjoy it you just wasted 2 hours of your life too bad
<START> beware my lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man harry horner better known for his set designs robert ryan plays a handyman who is hired by ida lupino to do some housework for her the problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesn't know it miss lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win ryan over to little avail he is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him he suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence which he later forgets br br essentially the effect ryan has on lupino is that of the hunter and his prey or in another sense a sadist the audience finds out early on that ryan is a mad killer but it takes lupino much longer thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor miss lupino try everything in her power to 'win' ryan over in order to make things work get the job done get on with life but getting on with things isn't in ryan's makeup as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself br br as a study in mental illness the movie isn't too impressive what it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness with dangerous in the mix and its effect on a normal person in this regard the film is realistic and compassionate though relentlessly logical in that we know lupino can't ryan yet we want her to the result is that if one is willing one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside so to speak its melodramatic structure br br horner shows us gradually the layout the lupino house a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home we become familiar with staircase kitchen and pantry and we come to know which windows miss lupino can use for an escape and which ones she can't
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life i can't believe people actually a write scripts like this b have a budget to make a film c actually expect it to be successful words can't even describe how horrible this film is i enjoy my fair share of teen movies but this didn't even come close to being funny in fact it was funny for the sole reason that it was so horrible i can probably count one maybe two parts in the film where i even managed to squeeze out a chuckle other than the laughs regarding how bad it was br br renting this was one of the biggest mistakes i've ever made its been a day since i've seen the film and i'm still in shock regarding how horrible it was avoid at all costs br br 2 10
<START> michael ritchie's the couch trip is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist it is so subtle and wicked that you start to realize what a stinging satire it really is it is also dan best movie made in a particularly great film year 1988 for him first the great outdoors and now this br br akyroyd stars as john burns a career crook who fakes insanity to escape prison now a dumb comedy would just be about this but the couch trip uses this as a springboard for everything else beverly hills psychiatrist george charles grodin subtly hilarious here has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected lawrence who happens to be psychiatrist you can pretty much guess what's going to happen but the great thing about the couch trip is not what happens but how it is done br br the couch trip gives dan akyroyd the best role he has ever had his john burns is one of the truly original comic creations in movie history wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it but what makes it special is that akyroyd makes burns a lovable character we root for him and grow to like him a whole lot during the 98 minute running time br br but akyroyd isn't alone here he gets strong support from other great comic actors walter matthau joins the hilarity as a con artist minister who catches on to burns' secret and commits genteel blackmail charles grodin slow burns his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist grodin has been one of the most underappreciated actors in hollywood it's criminal they haven't used him more often richard romanus plays grodin's slimeball lawyer to perfection br br the couch trip is one of many films made by the now defunct orion pictures corporation that are currently unseen mgm spent a fortune buying the orion library but have yet to truly cash in on their acquisition the couch trip joins dressed to kill blow out and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault shame on mgm for their inaction hopefully with new management the couch trip will find the audience and respect it deserves br br out of 4 stars
<START> the movie is okay meaning that i don't regret watching it i found the acting purely and the most of the dialog stupid oh no this was my grandmothers bible it's sort of bad remake of u turn a man arrives to a desert town out in nowhere meets the wrong people and falls in love with the wrong woman and off cause get's involved in something he thought he could leave behind him the movie is quite predictable and there is really nothing new in it when it's finish you didn't really care most of the characters are stereotypes specially brian austin green all in all just another movie from the states but okay entertaining on boring wednesday night imdb vote 4 10
<START> there's a good story well hidden and never really used br br the film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography somehow character and story development have been forgotten what is left is muddled and superficial br br turn off your brain and will probably find that the time goes quickly enough but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film br br watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental
<START> as much as i love trains i couldn't stomach this movie the premise that one could steal a locomotive and drive from arkansas to chicago without hitting another train along the way has to be right up there on the impossible plot lines hit board imagine two disgruntled nasa employees stealing the crawler that totes the shuttles to and fro and driving it to new york and you get the idea br br having said all that it's a nice try wilford is at his oats best and levon helm turns a good performance as his dimwitted but well meaning sidekick bob balaban is suitably wormy as the corporate guy and the little guy takes on goliath story gets another airing
<START> a small town kid working in a big city becomes a huge star and then spirals out of control it shows you the rise to fame and then fall from fame and back to a little rise great cast of actors and a great director a great great movie called boogie nights br br p t anderson an amazing director who made boogie nights amazing from the moment the movie starts to the moment it ends you can feel how beautiful this movie is some scenes are breathtaking literally a great story a great movie mark whalberg was fantastic philip seymour hoffman was wonderful as he is in everything thomas jane also was magnificent and although he only had a small part he played it to perfection there is one scene in this movie i can't get over the drug deal gone bad scene it was amazing music acting and cinematography combined to make it amazing i hadn't seen boogie nights and thank god i did its so well rounded and i am now a huge fan of pta paul thomas anderson br br do whatever you have to do and watch this movie
<START> well i should say the only film related to club dj electronic music and raves that ravers respect br br seriously now it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver albeit its in a club its in wales and its somewhat dated the film leaves out some of the elements of club life but doesn't disassociate from them altogether it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives br br at the core of the film and the best element of justin kerrigan's script is the characters eccentric unique yet completely understandable and accessible this film simple would not work and be infinitely less entertaining were it not for jip nina and lulu viewers can deny the political and social implications of the subtext of human traffic as a drug film trainspotting wannabe important peg in british youth culture circa 90's but they can't deny that these are engaging characters br br it's frantic its brutally honest it's sobering it's over the top but its a great comedy br br raves are a complex thing so are the drugs that are taken at these events so are the people you will encounter but from someone who has gone to parties become jaded and still goes human traffic is the best snapshot that could be taken of the subculture just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic
<START> i made the mistake of watching dark star 1974 late one night many years ago it was one of the stupidest movies that i have ever watched br br 1 bad acting br br 2 bad writing br br 3 scientifically stupid plot destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or in the way will only make matters worse instead of having one large easily avoidable object you'll have thousands of smaller but equally lethal and more difficult objects to track br br 4 completely unrealistic characters a painted beach ball as a space alien the writers must have been doing too many drugs br br not surprisingly the majority of actors that starred in dark star never did anything else of those that did do anything else the majority never acted again after dark star therefore having dark star on one's acting resume was a death star to one's acting career
<START> spoilers throughout this is a very strange film particularly for its time in every respect for six years american movies had shown american soldiers as everybody's son brother father br br in movies like the best years of our lives and til the end of time our hearts are tugged by the difficulty that the sweet returning soldiers have in adjusting to peace and their families yet in this same year this film shows soldiers as a mix of people rather worse than the viewer one message of this film is lock up your daughters br br even the good soldiers with plenty of time on their hands are gambling all the time getting stupefyingly drunk and are wholly indifferent to whether they even have wives any more and their reaction to the police investigating a murder is to conspire against them br br mitchum the most sympathetic soldier says things like i don't know if my wife wants to make a go of it now after the war haven't seen her in two years do i care not really maybe we'll make a go of it maybe not br br another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive because after years away he would like to see his wife again br br later when this soldier states at the police station that he spent the evening at a whore's home without knowing his wife is sitting just behind him there seems to be no question whatever that his wife will be fine indeed she is i guess it's hey soldiers will be soldiers br br the police detective played by robert young who is trying to crack a murder case states convincingly and with infinite weariness about someone's account of their actions on the night in question br br do i care no i don't really care about anything any more i've done this too long i guess br br a man shows up at the whore's apartment he says i'm just a man like you interested in the whore then he says no that's a lie i'm her husband i'd like to be in the military i was turned down before t br br hen he says no that's a lie why would i want to be a soldier he goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is to the end of the movie we haven't a clue who he is or why he is there he's one of the strangest characters in the history of movies br br a man stands with his girlfriend at a bar talking to four soldiers when a clumsy soldier knocks a drink onto his girlfriend she leaves to change her dress and is right back wearing another no problem yet the man doesn't leave with his girlfriend who simply disappears but instead follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of the bar the man then extrapolates from the minimal information he's learned about the soldier to philosophize grandly about the problems of returning soldiers and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick this is strange stuff br br similarly a dance hall girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her out for a real dance and dinner maybe yet she does dance with him and immediately gives him the key to her home br br were people in the late 1940s always urging soldiers to come to their homes after they just met them br br robert ryan kills his host a stranger when he's enraged that the jewish host tries to get the steadily ryan out of his home the reason for the murder no jew tells me how to drink how to drink huh what does that mean br br this movie is always off kilter quite deliberately so the soldiers act consistently with total complete defiance of the law and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie i've ever seen br br and yet the movie is utterly gripping you simply have no idea how these people are going to act or what new bizarre character is going to pop up without anyone thinking the person's actions are strange in the least e g the wife's behavior br br the acting is about the finest ever seen from robert young robert ryan gloria grahame who earned an oscar nomination paul kelly and other actors i'd never heard of br br i'd never heard of this movie and it's a complete delight that i've discovered one that i shall want to see again and again and again it's really strange but impossible to look away from because you've no idea what these creatures will do next
