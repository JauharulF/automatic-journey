<START> there are many so called anti war anti govt policy films around now which start off as a mea and end with 'our poor boys are getting hell out there so let the world sympathise with them it's not their kind of stuff i was half afraid that this would be another in that style even if it treated another subject aspect of the same subject i nearly didn't go and see it for that matter i almost did not write this review what did we get here an egyptian gets taken off to a secret off shore torture centre on u s orders but it is another egyptian who has to do the torturing not an american 'see we americans have clean hands ' and the egyptians are a bad lot anyway so let them harm their own oh and the goody had to be an american with a conscience indeed many americans have them but here the concept was misplaced yes we all know it is called extraordinary rendition and it began in clinton's time and it is now used for reasons well beyond control otherwise it was very hackneyed and nervous about really condemning the u s for being party to torture as if the makers were afraid to go the whole way for fear of being as unpatriotic or whatever take a look at the message board anyone apologising gets a faceful of heavy verbal artillery torture is a terrible thing whether one is guilty or not in the 18th century king of prussia abolished it for convicted murderers though i must say a life sentence for a child molester is far less than what i want to see all right what about torture this film did not really bring out its horror and hopelessness enough when you are under torture now come the capitals for emphasis i am not shouting you will say anything even if it is not true even if you have not done the thing you are accused of in the vain hope that if you say amen to whatever they are it will stop it does not but you never learn and you keep on saying that you did whatever it is they say you did tho' you did'nt another thing the film did not bring out enough was that torture is exceedingly indescribably humiliating and that feeling stays with you your whole life it somehow changes people inside how do i know all that don't ask br br re edit two things the arabic that was used in the film was not the egyptian dialect it's sort of worse than setting a film in new zealand with locals as the characters and everyone has american accents also the dreadful little preacher who was inciting his ignorant audience to violence was telling them things unknown to that religion which should have been brought out nor was it anywhere explained that any can become a imam he doesn't need any special qualifications and that is a hiatus which needs to be put right many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views and u s a 's great ally saudi arabia finances so many of them many thanks for this space

<START> in red letters coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for there are two reasons to watch this flick kinski is one and piven the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster everything is wrong with red letters convoluted lousy screenplay camera editing and most of all acting which is subpar for coyote etc has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time
<START> it has a bit of that indie queer edge that was hip in the 90s and which places an explicit sell by date on the visual style characters are uniformly apathetic and farcically deadpan street hoodlums in greece wear new clothing out of the box without or stains they all appear to visit the same marine hair dresser all uniformly exhibit the same low iq when making their dispassionate underground business deals when things go wrong its all because they aren't real greeks they're pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world makes a big whine about disaffected immigrants but never bothers to actually investigate the problems with russian kazakh albanian cultures if had the proper perspective on this project it might have made a wonderful bel ami production the fleeting glimpses of toned boy beef is the only spark in this generic small time mobster programmer
<START> there are two ways to regard either it is a dazzling mind blowing collage of music old film clips psychedelia and t v sitcom style comedy or a plot less pretentious rambling mess the truth probably lies somewhere in between it is also one of the best movies of all time br br 'the davy jones peter mickey dolenz and mike had just finished their hit series and wanted to do a movie in collaboration with writer jack nicholson and director bob they made br br it begins at a bridge opening ceremony in san francisco where the monkees gate crash the proceedings mickey jumps over the safety rail plunging hundreds of feet into the water mermaids rescue him to the accompaniment of a gorgeous jerry carole king composition called 'the song' and visuals that make the stargate finale of look drab by comparison by now you will either have switched off in puzzled disgust or be completely captivated br br more bizarre happenings unfold mickey uses a tank to destroy a coca cola machine in the middle of the desert the entire italian army surrenders to him the group are hired to play to play the in victor mature's hair for a television commercial an overweight waitress insults the group describing them as 'god's gift to the eight year a surprise birthday party for mike goes wrong the group are sucked into a vacuum cleaner and to cap it all are driven away inside a giant glass tank br br you will either hate this or love it i found it a refreshing change from mindless pop musicals of the 'let's do the show right here' variety the songs are good too song' is superbly choreographed by toni basil later to appear in and boasts wonderful editing with clothes changing colour at lightning speed 'as we go is a lovely king number whose accompanying images carry a strong environmentalist message br br frank zappa annette funicello are just two of the guest stars to crop up did victor mature read the script before agreeing to do this one wonders he's hilarious in it though br br so mad there just has to be real genius behind it is a little '60's gem and one worth revisiting time and time again shame it did not find an audience at the time if only had been like this
<START> i've read a lot of reviews on the imdb well all five of the ones that have been written at the time that i'm writing this and i'm surprised at the amount of praise heaped upon the brideless groom which is undoubtedly one of the lesser comedies performed by the stooges i prefer the older ones where it was larry curly and moe although shemp gets credit for most of the funny scenes in sing a song of six pants another stooges short which is only moderately amusing but far superior to brideless groom indeed there is a single slightly amusing scene in the film the don't hit a lady scene which is barely amusing at all and is 15 minutes into the film not very promising in a 17 minute comedy br br shemp is a voice trainer whose uncle has passed away and left him an inheritance of 500 000 provided he get married within 48 hours which is short enough notice as it is but by the time shemp learns about it he has only 7 hours left this is a premise that had been done and redone before but was not i don't think a massive clichÃ© at the time this film was made as it is now there are a series of gags throughout the film none of which are even close to the level of comedy for which the three stooges are so widely known it seems that the stooges have run into the same troubles that plagued so many of shirley temple's films Â there is too little reliance on content and too much reliance just on the fact that they're there br br the standard characteristics of the stooges are here moe is the mean one whose meanness is certainly not used sparingly in this film and the slapstick sound effects although with more exceptions than usual are fairly amusing but are plugged into their standard slots in this film the line hold hands you lovebirds is immortal the rest of the film is not br br there is much talk among the other people who have reviewed this movie for this site about this being one of the best of the stooges shorts that you won't find one weak moment about how this is their best since the early 30s shorts it's just not true i can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for milestone classics and for the giants of early comedy which the three stooges certainly are but that respect is damaged when poorer films are praised more than they should be the brideless groom deserves some respect because it is a stooges film but for exactly the same reason it should have been better the three stooges were just better than this
<START> this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early high school age kids maybe to them it's funny they may possibly even see something scary in it to me the acting is poor and plot is poor there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer i saw this film as weak and boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they don't seem to have any substance other than the look at times i wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again this movie just wasn't good for me
<START> i wrote this as a two part review part two has spoilers br br part 1 br br no this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents this is the one about racism in l a you know the one where everybody is a racist and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times race br br its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme race racist racism race relations relay race br br paul haggis made a movie which took the structure of magnolia which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected and then screwed it into a mental vomit about racism in america race in the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race the first hour people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in america br br for example the story with ludicrous and larenz tate provides the comic relief too bad the first half of their story is lifted straight from the bonnie situation in pulp fiction racism their section is the quentin tarantino section where instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion the characters talk about race and racism constantly br br the other good thing about it is the mexican story when the mexican guy is talking to his daughter he gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets decent writing but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place br br the rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous the hindi does not act in any semblance of realism the scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid why would anybody act like that is it realistic nooo it reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from the doom generation six dollar sixty six cents girly if i ever watch the second half of the movie i hope his head is shot off and his head starts coughing up relish br br i haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph race racism race for the sun better then there is the black guy who wants to be white matt dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks ryan phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog when matt dillon the black producers wife could i help it if i was cracking up when philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism can i help but crack up the movie is so funny when it is being racist racist racist i tell you br br now mind you this movie was nominated for best picture best director best screenplay and best editing besides a nod to matt dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job who was paid off for that one i have no clue br br don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form br br d br br part 2 br br the second half of crash takes any and all story lines in the first half and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive the world is a big coincidence kind of way and it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it br br take 1999's magnolia people weren't conveniently tied together over and over again they were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think you know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme br br the stories are lined up so everybody meets again are there only 5 on the lapd force aren't these people working weird shifts dillon and philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day and why did tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker wouldn't it have had more emotional tension as well as realism if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long like phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out be freaking out br br eventually in the second half the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the hindi to shoot the daughter it ticked me off and made me feel dirty not that the hindi shot the daughter but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up it really ticked me off at the writers not the scene br br the whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for the coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief unlike magnolia which was connected mildly this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so over the top the only good part in the second half was when sandra bullock falls down the stairs she doesn't die though she should have i cheered when she fell br br the worst part about the movie is it pulls a magnolia not just in structure but it has a montage over the song in the deep where you see everybody being depressed magnolia took this and had post modern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to aimee mann's wise up unfortunately magnolia came out in 1999 while crash came out in 2005 its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years but it happened somehow br br utter waste of my time br br first half d second half lowest grade ever overall f
<START> this documentary on dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and very well made however i found myself watching many of the bits with unease the film generally took a rather confident stand on anything it said and showed but inevitably much of the behaviour of the beasts their interaction with each other what they looked like how they moved what they ate etc much of that is surely guessing sometimes guessing with reasonable confidence sometimes just wild guessing but the viewer is never made aware of that the film pretends to actually observe real dinosaurs and their real behaviour etc that makes probably better viewing than confronting the audience with mountains of disclaimers but it makes it just a bit too populist in my estimation
<START> as someone who was in a pan hellenic sorority i wasn't sure what to expect when i tuned into this show after seeing so many over dramatizations in made for tv movies and the craziness of the reality shows i was curious to see if greek would be able to show the true college and greek life experience br br i was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the ever familiar characters of this genre but it was also able to add depth to the characters greek life isn't just about parties and petty conflict although those things happen within greek life they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout a person's life to characterize it as some exclusive experience to those in a greek organization would be false most of the story lines and situations taking place in greek can and do take place everywhere in every circle of friends on sports teams in real life but i've watched both episodes and my little sister whom i'm still very close to and i have spent both episodes laughing and being reminded of how they've truly captured the spirit of our college years and experiences br br i liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other facets of their lives school relationships goals etc telling rusty that school comes first and going to your brothers for help that was very true to life you can't stay in an organization if you have bad grades the way rusty got his assignment to his professor was far fetched but it was entertaining even the dynamic between casey and rusty it happens you grow up and whatever your relationship with your sibling s was it changes so you must adjust br br the bottom line greek is a great show great entertainment value and enough real life in there to be believable and definitely worth the viewers time
<START> i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining good characters good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout the plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller if you liked this film i would recommend the spanish prisoner the house of games and no way out
<START> wings hauser and son cole hauser team up to make a film about neo nazi thugs targeting a gay man and terrorising a city wings plays the hero and his real life son is the villain fairly low budget film that has not many redeeming features and for some reason no one has seen it perhaps because it is quite a laughable and ridiculous film and the studio realised this maybe wings hauser himself prevented the distribution of after seeing it himself maybe people just didn't want to comment on such a bad film oh well i generally like wings and cole as actors but this was a film that they both should have skipped wings directed wrote and was the lead actor in an extremely bad and stupid film 1 2 out of
<START> poor diane arbus whoever she was not only was she according to this movie a spoiled but sweet acting upper east side brat she was a bad wife bad mother awful business partner plus there is no evidence in this picture that she was any kind of an artist except in the bold statement in the prologue br br nicole kidman who incredibly is more attractive today than 25 years ago and actually looks younger indeed gives an excellent performance but what can an actress do with a wife and mom who seeks out and falls for an incredibly weird werewolf looking guy living in the apartment upstairs set in the early 1970's manhattan was a virtual magnet for freaks and of all sizes and shapes most not looking like human so why is this affair worthy of a minute movie br br robert downey jr used to be one of my favorites but i'd say his well known and prolonged use of drugs has taken its toll one might think he'd be to be in a movie that treats drug use as casually as it does smoking cigarettes br br fur has already taken a beating at the box office but in view of those who input a score of 10 for this misbegotten slice of trash i'd like to say so mcgee
<START> it really is terrible from start to finish you'll sit and watch this ridiculous idiot thinking hes cool when he's really not rubbish plot line terrible acting and complete waste of time and money do not bother
<START> inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is br br the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style br br desperate seek for inspiration and his conscious led him to live the way he did restless outrageous and yes very drunk br br but still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist respect to his master respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection
