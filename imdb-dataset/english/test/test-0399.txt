<START> who should watch this film anyone who has ever taken acid read philip k dick thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in philosophy or likes having their sense of reality messed with i laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spot on this film is great this film is cool it is better than the matrix by a long shot i didn't fall asleep in for a kick off action special effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that is exactly what the matrix is is gross it is disturbing and it is funny david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff rabid and some works of genius too videodrome is another one worth checking out as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone but this is one of my all time favourites i can't remember the ending which is a good thing cos it means i can watch it again or perhaps i never watched this film at all maybe it's an implanted memory or maybe it 'really' happened to me i don't know at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality and i'm glad
<START> there is no denying that this is a bad movie the acting isn't great likewise the script acting and direction still i cannot wait until its 2 23 99 video release from anchor bay everyone knows there are several bad movies out there that have a tremendous appeal to them this one tops my list
<START> i really did not want to write a harsh review of this movie because i genuinely appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget let alone attempt something as ambitious as a sci fi br br however this movie is truly awful the acting is among some of the worst i have ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget movies that is a pretty serious accusation to make there are plenty of aspiring actors out there who would work on a deferred payment scheme if they believed in the movie and what the director was trying to achieve i'm sure the actors did their best as did everybody else involved in this production but it simply was not good enough to pull off something of this magnitude br br then there is the dialogue very poor indeed there is no excuse for that i got the impression the script was hastily written on the back of a beer mat after some epic boozing session i hesitate to use the word but that's exactly what the script is i had no empathy with any of the characters indeed they grated on me with the result that on more than one occasion i wanted to thump a couple of them mr has overstretched himself by taking on too many roles clint eastwood he is not again there are talented people out there willing to work on deferment if they believe in the project br br much has been made of the special effects in this movie for the money they are exceptional if somewhat overused it is like someone said i have after effects and boy am i gonna use it whoever did the cg work was among the most talented of this crew br br quite simply the money was not available to make as ambitious a movie as this attempts to be kudos for attempting it but unfortunately it fails to reach its heady goals in far too many ways br br i salute everyone involved with its production i really do but for their next effort they either need to get a better producer or lower their sights to something more manageable br br in conclusion i cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic of film students or habitual insomniacs if you want to watch a true masterpiece of low budget sci fi films try the student made dark star by a certain mr john carpenter
<START> this film wasn't good at all i was able to catch it at a film festival and didn't appreciate the content i was forced to watch it's a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone gabrielle union dies the film stars billy dee williams as union's brother well actually gabrielle union portrayed the woman in her early years which should help explain why the woman was billy dee williams older sister this had to be billy dee william's worst performance in his career ever he looked as if he didn't remember his lines in a few scenes he was an unlikable hardly ever empathetic character who fathered a daughter while married to a white woman whom he already had a daughter with as well the two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman lucy was trying to connect with him his other daughter didn't want anything to do with him billy dee's character was so pathetic that the only way they can get him to fly in from paris for his sister's funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and his late sister left him with the responsibility of handling her paperwork why they had to fool him because he didn't like attending funerals i know you're asking but he didn't want to attend his own sister's funeral too yes he claims he didn't like being around the forced feelings of emotions that is shared amongst the people paying their respects he didn't want anything to do with that now we're suppose to empathize with that a hole the rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters the director and editor didn't care to consider the pacing of the film the flashbacks were painful to watch it was a bad film however it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals a film that glorifies african americans dependence on caucasians to find a love that they can settle down with even if it is a healthy relationship when lame love stories like this win best of festivals at the black film festivals it makes me question the judgment of black people on film in these same festivals the only films that win awards are educational films about african american culture and black films directed by caucasian directors i'm not saying that anything is wrong with a white person directing stories written for people of color the problems with these films is that they never argue from both point of views which are usually the films that actually speaks to the masses these films are often one sided forms of these films fail at executing the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is revolved around the writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it these films always slant the argument what i am saying is are the people running these black film festivals judging a film off of pure content which to me means directing acting writing cinematography editing etc or are they judging films off of strictly the message being delivered about african american culture are we suppose to expect a film like constellation to have a shot in the world against films like million dollar baby and sideways what happened to film being entertaining when i mean entertainment i mean the ritual of sitting in the dark staring at the screen investing tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfying meaningful emotional experience why can't these festivals appreciate films that get their messages across without preaching why can't these black film festivals acknowledge films that are well told pieces of work that are brutally honest telling the truth i believe we have no responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity to uplift the spirits of society or even express our inner being we have only one responsibility to tell the truth robert mckee now that's something i totally agree with these same black film festivals put down hustle and flo as if it is that awful film stereotyping blacks however it's an honest film about a pimp with a dream a pimp can't dream i recall the last time i saw a real pimp he was a human being and aren't they pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society at large not just in the black community but all over the powers that be in black hollywood believe that films like this are making afro americans look bad in the eyes of others as if others don't know that there are pimps in the hood the truth is until african american people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world then our films will never have a chance in the world this film was awful the best thing was the cinematography and zoe
<START> lonely among us definitely is one of the best first season episodes the storyline although somewhat confusing creates a lot of suspense supported by the creepy synthesizer driven soundtrack this is a typically alien body invasion scenario but finally turning out to no evil purpose the death of assistant chief engineer singh to me was an accident the two delegate species deliver an entertaining frame best make up so far finally adding a little black humor to the series the final scene patrick stewart obviously enjoys stepping out a bit of his picard character and exploring some new terrain as does data by posing as sherlock holmes another all time classic the special effects are also convincing and director cliff bole did his job well he is the first one trying to compensate trois lack in acting ability by improving her looks she does look beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress improves her appearance a lot picard's lightning scene on the bridge gives him a slight air of the emperor of star wars return of the jedi which is a personal impression but made me smile br br there's also some playing with the lighting of the corridors simulating night aboard and the first moving camera pulling back from picard when he's entering the transporter room to beam into the cloud nice work the clever cutting creating continuing dialog through different scenes troi's hypnosis report rounds up the impression of a really well crafted tng episode the first one where even wesley crusher seemed almost tolerable br br the ending however is a bit confusing just as if the producers were running out of time p for picard is a little far fetched and his return far too easy but that can be left aside regarding the many strong moments this episode has to offer
<START> joe is the movie about the dark side of the force of the 1960's in america and susan sarandon had nice boobs this movie scared me so much when i saw it in the theatre that i never liked peter boyle until young frankenstein and was still quite leery of him even after that comedy looking back now from today's experience this film seems current again in being direct and to the point of half the approval of john joe the plumber typecast and their fear of electing a black man as president of the usa in the coming weeks a black prez would be seen as sweet revenge of the but bound to again bring fire to many minds if not the streets this time by joe enthusiasts so the spirit of joe in the film is resurrected in the campaign of joe the plumber still i love to be american and be terrified at both and by the knowledge that they illustrate what ironically gregory peck said our civilized law also is a living breathing reality god help us
<START> this film is based on a true story the author of the novel bearing the same title had a brother who turned mentally ill i found this film very moving following the main character's path down into illness to see how he tries to cope with life after diagnosis and how he makes friends at the mental institution it all is very convincing there are quite a few splendidly funny incidents also in the manuscript the title of it gives nothing away concerning the story you must watch it to understand and listen to the music which is twisting and turning your heart and soul upside down and back as the film moves on a must see for everyone
<START> this is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the between required public life and the need for privacy robert taylor has been primed by corporate head burl ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation he sends him to england to negotiate a deal where taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it he comes back handed having done his duty but having told the truth to the english about his motives he attempts to marry the refugee rather than the boss's niece and so begins an attempt by ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive it could have been gritter nastier and less romantic the amount of time spent on the romance skews the film away from the points it's trying to make about corporate ethics br br somehow the costume design was nominated undeservedly for an oscar it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively studio politics at work yet again no doubt br br what is however is the black and white cinemascope cinematography which is excellent this if anything deserved the oscar nom it was mgm's first film in b w br br not as good as it could have been but not terrible either
<START> this show was a pleasant surprise after watching mad tv on a saturday night spike is an excellent host that you can tell is still getting used to it but he is doing great adjusting to his new job i can imagine it being a difficult transition from writer seinfeld to host however unlike a lot of new talk show hosts he does not let airtime ride while trying to figure out what to do next he is quick minded and each segment and section rolls into one another smoothly it also doesn't hurt that he's kinda sexy in a nerdy type of way so he's not hard on the eyes like leno or letterman i can't remember the exact episode date that was my favorite but i especially loved the idiot paparazzi skit with a fake j lo and katie holmes great new show
<START> awful awful awful br br i loved the original film it was funny charming and had heart this piece of junk has none of those things br br reused jokes from the original film stupid plots bad animation different voices with the exception of and that sound nothing like the ones in the original especially shudder br br the characters are off model the animation is flat and boring it's just a bad job all around br br and why is a jerk again i thought he had reformed but since when are these tv spin offs loyal to the original rolls eyes br br i'm sorry but there is nothing redeemable about this at all br br avoid at all costs
<START> one of earliest films made in france is possibly his only political satire the story of the frogs who wanted a king mirrors its title as a group of high feel that democracy has gone flat so they demand a king from jupiter to rule their land when he sends down a stump the frogs ask for another king saying the stump is but political timber jupiter sends down a hungry stork this time whose frog lusty eyes devour the town's residents as the original is about to slide down the beak he speaks his moral let well enough alone this film features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet frogs starewicz tricks the audience into believing they are all moving at once by keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs or so at one time the slightly corny dialogue and problems with lighting in a few places diminish the quality of repeat viewings however its historical significance in starewicz's life make it of importance to watch his feelings towards government immediately following his flee from russia are likely expressed in this film in addition the technical accomplishments of animating so many characters at once in a stop motion film is astounding
<START> now i love bad old movies as much as most people and i understand that a budget is a budget that said planet of the dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get the thing has no actors and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming ashore there are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid the only thing not wasted was paper the screenplay must have been no more than four pages long surely no one actually wrote dialogue this pointless i'm constantly amazed that such movies ever got made much less released i'm only glad i didn't pay to see this waste of time it's 75 minutes of my life i'll never get back
<START> the film had no help at all promotion wise if there was an advertising promo on tv or radio i didn't see hear it the only newspaper ad i saw was on it's opening weekend a dingy b w head shot photo of andy as val com behind jail bars with headline wanted runaway robot which was also the poster in front of the 3 movie theaters i saw it at not the nice little color poster on this site with of all the cast and cartoon of which really wasn't that good they ought to have used an action scene from the film itself didn't they have an onset photographer a poster is supposed to help a prospective audience decide if they want to see the movie there were so many people who couldn't get into their sold out choice and wanted to know what was about and that poster didn't help that dingy pic and the only other photos supplied to papers were so indistinguishable in b w that they were worthless there was no trailer for the film only a slide at one theater consisting of the word inside a heart shape with a cupid's arrow through it and one that was a totally black picture just andy and voices saying val com my pleasure center is so is mine do you think we ought to tell our owners that is no help to people who hadn't been aware of the movie br br during the filming andy told reporters that he couldn't eat once his plastic lips were applied so he would load up on breakfast and fast during the day's shoot i don't know what bernadette did but at the time i'd wondered why they didn't just sip protein drinks through long straws or eat astronaut style food via tubes br br phil co the baby robot seemed to have been the pre curser to short johnny five with the same eyes similar face i've been trying to find if they had the same designer but no help i have vintage magazine articles about the film and the design team was immensely proud of their work and were going for a special award for their innovative device to create smoke for cigars just shortly thereafter did not use that device though they ought to have for return of the jedi's scenes with jabba the hut a man created steam around jabba by blowing cigar smoke into a tube joking that all he needed was a glass of brandy and he'd be a happy man i thought that using of real tobacco products was insensitive to people who were upset by smoke br br john williams who had then recently succeeded the late great arthur fielder as the maestro of the boston pops which was then a ratings hit but it never recovered from death and is now a shadow of it's former glory was using the show to promote films with which he supplied the music he'd premiered the empire strikes back score there and you would think he'd have helped along by playing a few numbers there the one thing that critics had liked of this film was williams' score yet it was not available for purchase i saw one vinyl album in 1982 with half half another film but it disappeared i only just tonight saw the cd listed on this site and have ordered it if i can ever get a scanner and time to type out the articles i'd like to create a tribute site i liked the movie and don't care what dissenters say br br the only trouble with the film was that near the end it was messed up logic wise the robots ran away from the factory to have the freedom to decide their own fate make their own choices yet when the junkyard owners tell them that phil needs to go to the factory to have a purpose programmed into him they don't even question it they just glance meaningfully at each other and they go along the way each of the adults lose battery power and die they aren't really dead as they are robots and only need new batteries yet it is treated as death with little phil crying over them and rolling away so what was the point of this phil never gets back to the factory and gets a purpose and of course the junkyard owners could've driven them or given them all battery with back up batteries but the real point was to have this poignant scene where the robots all wore down and phil is left to cry br br at the end val com is a golf instructor and aqua com is i'm not sure what is an entertainer what else is he supposed to be i'm not sure that they made it clear the junkyard owners seem to be taking it easy lying on chaise lounges drinking lemonade from phil their bartender val's and new daughter i think the name is maybe it's doesn't seem to be much more than a table lamp br br there is missing footage which is sad from photos i surmise that the stuff missing includes a sweet scene where phil is having a christmas with val gifting him with a car's steering wheel aqua is supplying a horn has taken the firefighter helmet to give to phil as we saw and they have christmas trees i don't know if any missing footage supplies better logic or if the writers just couldn't think of a better crisis resolution the film was trimmed to 72 75 minutes to pair it with other failing films no other reason than that for a dvd i would love to be in on creating as i want to see interviews with the cast crew and john williams and the griffin interview the making of footage and and restoring the missing footage to make it better
<START> i think that complete savages is a very good tv show and they should make many more episodes it is one of my favourites it is very funny and it is really good acting i say that you should give them a chance to do more episodes that they can and they should they should put complete savages on nickelodeon more than what they do i'm sure that many people will agree with me i like the tv show because it is a very good programme for people our age and it is very funny i also like complete savages because it isn't always about the same thing and things that happen could be real unlike other programmes when they advertised it i didn't like the sound of it but i watched it for the first time and i loved it complete savages is an excellent comedy and i miss it being on tv i can't really compare complete savages with any other tv series because it is different
<START> lets be realistic here this is one of the worst shows i have ever seen my wife and kids showed real promise in its first season and only went down hill after that it is so bad that words do not describe the acting and writing are so dreadful on a consistent basis i wonder if damon wayans was producing such an atrocious show on purpose from top to bottom every performance is ridiculous damon wayans completely phones it in and george gore ii is so horrible i cringe at every over acted line can anyone really watch this show and find it to be entertaining let alone funny please i implore you do not watch this show as soon as tv stop picking this up in syndication we can finally be rid of this absolute garbage
