<START> some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story david lynch takes 2 and a half hours to piece together scenes with clues and his trademark oddity but there's never a story no plot no progression of the characters unless you find revealed delusion a progression it amazes me how anyone can call lynch's garbage art but if beauty rests in the eye of the beholder so be it lynch's movie and tv work in the 1980's came off as avant garde and alternative fine 20 years later work like mulholland drive comes off as a 2 5 hour david lynch masturbation piece it's embarrasing i've finally seen the movie that takes my top spot as the worst ever at least the people churning out godzilla and rodan weren't passing them off as art
<START> the contemporary chapter of the u s navy's elite underwater demolition team is called to do whatever they want apparently br br charlie sheen was made an officer already the storyline is unbelievable michael biehn is his immediate c o but he keeps charlie on a rather long leash and one of the guys pays for it early on by getting killed thanks to charlie's patented stupidity the rest of the team spends their spare time committing courts martial offenses mostly an exercise in random gunfire and paper thin ethics these particular seals might be better suited to serving as crash test dummies br br some good action scenes counter the goofy proceedings
<START> although this starts out promisingly a woman in a car is weaving around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a lizard this gave me the impression that we were going to see something special something almost david lynchian if there is such a term but unfortunately the film starts to go everyplace not having a core center just sort of meandering story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town the character study goes all over the place and i couldn't really care for any of the characters it seems especially when some of the story all of a sudden goes into flashback mode i had some hopes for this movie but all in all it was a bit of a letdown
<START> first of all this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it since i myself did not understand this horrible story further the unknown cast leaded by an actress called laura is simply awful the expressions and screams of the character sara tobias are laughable and ridiculous confusing grimaces with acting last but not the least there are many favorable reviews about this flick in imdb as follows br br top notch can't wait to see more of the directors work Â the author has only one review in imdb on 24 september 2004 br br incredibly shot amazingly intense Â the author has only one review in imdb on 12 august 2004 br br not your typical blood and gore in fact better 7 10 Â the author has only one review in imdb on 13 february 2005 br br as intense as asian horror the author has only one review in imdb on 14 november 2004 br br coincidence or are they the parents relatives friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap my vote is three br br title brazil 11 11 Â a nova 11 11 Â the new prophecy
<START> the only reason i watched this is because of its stars caspar van dien micheal pare eric roberts catherine jeniffer rubin all capable actors have given good performances in the past not this time a weak serial killer story you can guess who the killer is in the first scene very contrived in all aspects there is nothing to recommend in this disaster my rating is 1 2 poor
<START> everyone knows the so called plot so let me cut to the chase br br forced frivolity miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun the brilliant meryl streep gives it a great try pierce brosnan just plain embarrassing inexplicably set on a greek island lots of squealing shrieking women lots br br it was a silly juke box musical on stage now it's a big splashy poorly shot screen juke box musical if you like abba so so if not an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater i readily admit that i didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did but for the love of god why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have great night out on the town that's the feeling of this whole project it just felt so good when it stopped
<START> oh man they sure knew how to make them back then hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action hero br br this film was so close to a masterpiece alas it was not to be as it failed to feature ray guns and invaders from the moon the mst3k version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called captain cody where a guy with a rocket propelled jacket fights bad make up people from the moon but it didn't quite add up br br also the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as i expected them to be all in all a great disappointment
<START> don't get me wrong i enjoy art house movies low budget flicks character studies and foreign movies unfortunately i couldn't enjoy this one glacial pacing complete lack of plot and characters that you can't dislike enough to hate but you can't tolerate enough to like br br for me distant was like watching the cutting room floor footage of a reality show all of the scenes which were deemed too uninteresting which would normally not make the final cut were the only scenes included a camera in my apartment with two of my friends ambling around for hours does not an interesting movie make br br distant certainly makes the watcher feel that way long stretches of no dialogue nearly 10 minutes before the first word is spoken from the credits can be made to work 2001 comes to mind but for me something else compelling needs to happen to draw me in br br if you're the kind of watcher who can sit through a movie and be content with movie analysis perhaps it will work for you however if you're somebody who chooses to watch movies to relax expand your mind or be entertained you should probably look elsewhere
<START> a crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist catherine deane jennifer lopez who is desperately urged by two fbi agents peter novak vince vaughn and gordon ramsey jake weber to use her therapy on carl vincent a serial killer who uses strange and horrifying torture tactics is found in a coma by the feds what novak wants in return from deane is whereabouts of latest victim is and if she's alive once deane gets into mind which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of david lynch's dune or blue velvet and wes craven's a nightmare on elm street the adventure begins deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from carl as a youngster an adorable jake thomas to a freddy krueger like man minus the razor claws i don't want to give away the ending but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances howard shore's creepy musical score and directing by who shows here that he can direct
<START> i have tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time found it to be utterly pale of humor br br the reason to mention one thing is that it is solely based on ridiculing anything the republicans have done in short it is basically democratic party political opinions touted as humor br br all mr stewart does is wisecrack about anything the republicans have done and the audience wets themselves in gales of forced laughter br br my guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate republicans br br ld br br br br my faith http www angelfire com ny5 jbc33
<START> this movie has to rank with welcome to the jungle and the hitcher and dream catcher for sheer god awfulness you've got the most irritating heroine in gore history who spends most of her time sobbing and wailing and shrieking all the time in the most horrendous rest stop toilet ever put on film why she spends so much time in this ghastly bathroom from hell is never explained even when the usual killer truck driver is trying to murder her she refuses to leave the crapper when a motorcycle cop comes to her rescue the killer truck driver runs over the cop's legs while the heroine just looks on instead of grabbing his gun for protection she drags the poor slob into the crapper and locks the door then the cop orders her to blow his brains out because of the pain she does so while wailing and sobbing and and blows the back of his head off then the cop still alive beg her to shoot him again because he's still in pain he says this while the entire back of his head is all over the floor the sobbing wailing heroine shoots him again the movie goes on and on like this none of it making any sense the heroine is so dislikable you really want the killer to off her early on i saw this flick on the sci fi channel so it didn't cost me anything to watch but still i did watch out of sheer fascination as to how a movie could end up so terribly bad
<START> derek jarman has shown us time and time again that dialog is not his strong suit he is a painter and paint he does his films are almost always visually splendid but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry watch his movies in fast forward the really fast setting that you can only get on dvd in the tempest jarman does very little with the script or the characters using them as simply a to hang a very long and well constructed cinematographic frame he even goes so far as to contradict shakespeare's original script to achieve these slow and lifeless scenes there is none of the romance magic trickery or urgency the script calls for little spontaneity and the character of in particular is reduced to a quivering and insane idiot of sorts similar to in edward ii it is too bad that this is just about the only film version of the tempest available
<START> never before has such a large cast of ugly people gathered together to make an equally ugly film br br something huge and horrifying is loose in the waters off the florida coast something that leaves half chewed up bodies behind in its wake unshaven beer dependent bob thinks he has caught the thing's evil voice on tape bob's assistant the amazingly unattractive and painfully skinny stella decides to enlist the help of slimy ladies man peter an electrician whose equipment may be able to help them locate the mysterious creature but anyone who sticks their nose too far into the mystery winds up dead killed by a baboon faced hit man with a bad perm what is the terrible secret behind the sea killer br br ugly scientists have torrid affairs inept cops and doctors puzzle over the increasing numbers of corpses stella and peter make out on the beach and characters we don't care about are killed off or munched up the sea killer a weird combination of an octopus a shark and a pair of large dentures never really seems as threatening as it should the conspiracy behind the monster's creation makes no sense whatsoever none of the characters are particularly likable and the ones who might be are killed off immediately this is a poorly shot badly dubbed plot less mess the whole thing is so scuzzy and smelly it made me long for a hot bath i've had sushi plates scarier than this film avoid it unless it's the mst3k version
<START> it's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film jean pierre presumably had the chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and opted instead to use it as an excuse to make a soft porn movie having seen loved admired and respected se souvenir des belles choses which explores memory loss albeit as the result of alzheimer's in a profound and heartbreaking way not least in the luminous performance of isabelle carre i find that is an insult to se souvenirs i have no problem with soft porn per se and even if i had i'd virtually have to give up going to movies so prevalent is it today but i do have a problem with writers directors who attempt to it by it as here in the guise of medical research the sad thing is that fine actresses like julie so wonderful in clara et moi and anna who seems to have hit into a double play after last week's le deluge and now this are wasting their time on dross like this
<START> that is what this movie is good god the special effects suck in this movie it is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot but the special effects manage to pull it off let me try to explain just how bad this movie is br br first there is the plot there are four punk ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in mn one of them is a dumb ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg a paramedic comes to help him but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks then all five realize that there is a forest fire which we see is started by some guy dumping tons of gas all over the forest all they show us is his boots and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires meanwhile the teenagers try to escape the fire only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them while they were speeding through the forest on dirt bikes dump gas all over the area they were riding through and start more fires he does this several times and the paramedic finally catches him and starts him on fire i won't spoil the ending but this guy's resilience will have you shouting what the bloody hell at the screen anyway they are now surrounded by fire and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with methane gas yes methane gas i'm not even going to try to describe the ending because it is too ridiculous and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming which you won't because you can't possibly expect what happens this is because of the second major problem with this movie consistency br br is some semblance of consistence too much to ask for apparently so i cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes i think each character breaks at least one limb and several more than one they then limp around until the scene ends and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs there is one scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start dancing but then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to br br finally the cgi if there is a hell it consists of watching the fire in this movie all they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with cgi fire you can clearly see that the only cgi fire is along the paths and all of the trees more than two feet from the path are left untouched and then they zoom out and show the whole forest being engulfed in flames it's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks but i assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive br br this movie is one of those so bad its good types there are some occasions where it descends into the painful bad category but for the most part it stays above the line and is laughably inept i can't wait to check out the other nature unleashed movies that came in the four pack with this one
