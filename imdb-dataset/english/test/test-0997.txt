<START> jimmy wang yu an authentic asian superstar directed and wrote this film which i have only seen in a dubbed videotape version the widescreen shaw scope shape was lost and the original actor's voices absent but this is still good to watch the story is the usual martial arts school fights villains from japan plot with our young hero winning out in the end by beating up loads of assorted thugs br br the combat gets better as the film unravels early in the film it looks stiff and dull but later there is a great scene where wang yu fights hordes in a gambling joint then walks out into a snowy scene and takes some more villains on with knives sword and fists that part is very exciting br br quite good then but it would be interesting to see a non dubbed widescreen version if there is one
<START> six teenagers go to an old remote abandoned school where 27 years ago a horrible massacre took place for a night of fun and pranks instead the kids run afoul of the vicious crazed security guard excellently played with supremely creepy menace by spanish horror icon paul naschy who committed the nasty killings director carlos gil relates the intriguing story at a brisk pace and does an adept job of creating a compellingly spooky and mysterious atmosphere the witty script by and mercedes offers a clever and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer guessing to the very end the slick cinematography by fernando makes expert use of light and shadow david san moody score likewise does the trick the attractive and appealing young cast all contribute lively and engaging performances with especially praiseworthy turns by carlos as ringleader ramon olivia molina as the panicky maria zoe as obnoxious joker jordi and carmen morales as spunky goth chick sandra the murder set pieces are every bit as bloody and brutal as they ought to be terrific whammy of a surprise dark ending too a solid and satisfying shocker
<START> this movie sucked from beginning to end it was predictable there was absolutly no chemistry between pearce and the chick the plot went nowhere floating off into oblivion all of these led to the movie being very hilarious in its stupidity and i wanted to strangle orlando jones the guy just needs to go away
<START> i had no idea this movie was produced by wwe wrestling is lame enough why did they have to soil their name further by making a movie as crappy as this one was i found it to be a complete disappointment if i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was i would have stayed home and done something more entertaining sure i'll give them the credit of the cool effects but the killer didn't seem as scary as he could have been he lacked a number of things but i'll let you point them out for yourselves the plot was a great idea just could have been done in a much better way maybe in the future wwe will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry
<START> hard to believe but it is i shouldn't be surprised commercials try to show how unique and funny a show can be yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me i've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing either br br i don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness cuteness or humor the characters were insufferable for the most part especially selma blair's which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this the few moments where the characters were slightly redeemable were considerably hackneyed and trite br br rare is the show with no redeemable qualities at all and this is not one of them and kim has exactly one redeeming quality and that's selma blair despite wearing repugnant outfits and acting like a pitiful whiny stupid excuse for a young woman who seems like a cross between britney spears paris hilton and kim kardashian selma is still nice to look at br br but if you want to look at selma go rent hellboy you'll at least maintain a modicum of respect for her instead of searing this abominable character into your brain to associate with her br br all in all and kim is a waste and truly epitomizes the worst that tv is or ever has been it sets a new low
<START> this movie vampires the turning isn't even really worth the 2 out of 10 i'm giving it the movie is very predictable from beginning up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire slayers the use of music in this movie was even bad it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second though it never did the acting was b rank at best and the movie was just dull the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 is because the story had potential though it ended up unable to deliver oh and did i mention the wardrobe the wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to non existent because our hero and his girlfriend whom he's trying to save throughout the entire movie wear the same outfits through the entire movie i'd suggest this film only if your really bored and don't have a good wall with fresh paint to watch dry dave the horror cowboy
<START> i am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense such as that this film proves that when it is predestined love will find a way i begin in this way not to criticize a specific reviewer but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film even before it hit the theaters even the best of films do not prove anything nor are they intended to the best films entertain and move the viewer and the english patient fails on both criteria br br i remember the studio's promotion of the english patient very clearly from the producers of 'amadeus' and 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest ' it grandly announced an ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word producers in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of the english patient so very inappropriately with the truly great director milos forman such a comparison is offensive to the memory of mr forman br br while the novel by michael upon which the film was based is a good one it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar the film bears little resemblance to the novel br br despite misgivings which began when i heard that shamelessly misleading promotion i went to see this film in the theater as it began to unfold i realized that the rendering of the novel's peculiar magic had failed that the actors knew their words but not their characters and that their characters were flat dull and unengaging the film was a complete travesty of novel and a completely still born cinematic artifact of the worst description br br those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like sweeping and grand and hypnotic well it is none of those in fact not even fine novel could be described as sweeping or grand it could be described as magical and hypnotic yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver it is almost as if had as a reader entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale skeletal version a version that not only missed the spirit of the story but that focused on the wrong characters he produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story's metaphors but no apparent of them as well br br took the central focus away from hana and kip and put it on the patient and katherine clifton thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the essence of it br br ralph fiennes and kristen scott thomas put in unengaging uninspiring uninvolving unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great driving passionate love affair to the viewer but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable perfunctory liaison between two flat shallow uninteresting both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by grandiose and overblown presentation br br the grand sweeping david lean like qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there the comparison to david lean dr zhivago is positively insulting to yet another great director take for example the patient's sandstorm scene which is no doubt one wherein these grand sweeping qualities are believed to have resided or should have resided the sandstorm is not grand it is not even convincing the subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally completely lacked either drama or emotion in fact because it was so patently weak it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place br br this film failed it failed as a rendering of the novel and it failed as a film it seems to have been the oscar vehicle of the year joining such over filmic as kramer vs kramer or terms of endearment one can only thank god that even the hype driven acadamy br br had the good sense to present the best actress award to frances for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film fargo there was not a single performance in the execrable english patient that was not either embarrassingly horrid over acting willem dafoe or truly forgettable mediocre acting fiennes and scott thomas br br why this non entity of a film retains a coven of fanatical and clearly tasteless devotees will remain a mystery fortunately the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently and it will not thankfully have the strength ever to dig itself out
<START> this espionage melodrama has a nice almost promising cast and should have been very atmospheric there is a will or an intention of also a want or a lack of it br br sheen plays a dissident who now activates as an agent he is a loner loved by women but haughty mrs fossey is his mistress neill plays the gallant generous chivalrous soviet agent br br sheen and neill are both essentially annoying finlay does a cameo and so do other known actors mrs fossey is hot but then again she always is br br i will be your true friend and break it to flick is low on suspense and on excitement it's trite and quite boring the good thing is that you get to see mrs fossey naked other than that lukewarm derivative espionage exploitation
<START> redo the oscars from 1992 and this film might get nominated or even win it was so good at capturing its era and dual cultures that it belongs in american and japanese time capsules if you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then this film will show you as an american you'll feel like you tagged along for an extended japanese vacation and by the end of the film you'll be a die hard dragons fan as you accept the injection of japanese tradition and culture into their baseball much as we have done with our culture in our own game br br jack elliot tom selleck is a slumping aging detroit slugger who is traded to the dragons perennial runners up to the dynastic giants japan's answer to the yankees the giants are admired for their success yet that success also has everyone wanting to surpass them something which is rarely done the manager recruits jack as the final piece of the pennant winning puzzle and we're left with what could have been gung ho on a baseball field but instead was much more br br the casting was outstanding selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him he can carry a film as well as he did his television show and the japanese cast was equally good down to mr from die hard back as the image conscious owner the other actors including the one who plays the love interest also the manager's daughter strong and independent yet simultaneously a believer in japanese traditions beyond what was forced on her she is a proper and supportive girlfriend for jack even her father never tells her not to see him almost sympathizing with jack for what he endures from her and a bit relieved he at least knows the man she has chosen to love br br the baseball scenes are great bolstered immensely by a pre fame dennis haysbert as another american ex and jack's western mentor the usual fish out of water elements are there and you can almost feel yourself stumbling right along with jack to fit into a country that doesn't speak our language and doesn't practice our ways yet copies everything we do including our national pastime one of the funnier scenes occurs when jack clutching a magazine informs his manager that he has learned of the tradition in japan where you can get drunk and tell off your boss and it can't be used against you and exercises that right very humorously the plots and subplots are tied up neatly at the end but not too neatly and nothing concludes unrealistically br br to call this a comedy is misguided it's a pure comedy drama or even a drama with good humor the plot is too deep to dismiss it the way it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight film the situations were amusing but in their place against a far more serious profound and precisely detailed backdrop that results in one of the best films i've ever seen the baseball cinematography rivals that of for love of the game for realism br br some say the film is about baseball or about japan but more than anything it seems to be about the workplace and how people arrive at work from totally different origins with different agendas and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company or the team br br a truly great film that never should have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters
<START> one of the more prominent popular episodes but clearly one of the worst a red shirt female falls for khan instead of dropping dead for a change and then proceeds to betray kirk and the enterprise as if loyalty were a non existent character trait on the ship makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant starfleet uses to test people when hiring we have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in wink of an eye when a red shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love same as in ss however in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot this is very silly because it once again makes kirk's crew seem like a bunch of soft headed easy to impress morons who once they fall in love with the enemy are capable of doing just about anything the fact that switches back to kirk's side doesn't the illogic in any way lord and the lord br br why is khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength that's one of several st plot devices that undermine kirk's intelligence why does khan hold a knife against mccoy's throat if khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself and what's with a sikh being played with a latino accent montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach i was half expecting to hear the the in the background at any moment why the hell would kirk or any ship captain provide limitless use of the ship's library concerning the innermost technical details of the enterprise to anyone is the starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots br br ss is a very cartoonish silly episode so no wonder trekkies love it it doesn't have too many sci fi elements in it which is what trekkies hate the most it also figures that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie that way pleasing rabid trekkies who were so very disappointed with the first movie which you guessed it had far too much sci fi for the average tiny trekkie brain
<START> surprisingly good film made in the wake of the exorcist concerning a young woman who becomes possessed by a spirit after she goes to a de sanctified church to restore a life size and life like crucified man the piece was christ and the two thieves however christ was long ago sold off trouble starts once the figure is removed from the cross and it seems to come to life and seduce the woman from that point on it becomes a battle for the girls soul creepy scary and much better than you think the film works because its cast sells the events which are decidedly adult it helps that these are real people who are flawed so its easier to relate to them i really liked this film and seeing it again for the first time in at least a decade i was shocked at how good it is definitely better than any of its myriad of schlocky titles makes it seem
<START> my take typically routine and lazy straight to video attempt from disney br br disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog many movies have devoted themselves with stories that solely center themselves with man's best friend disney themselves have made a handful they also made a handful of those that are literally dogs add this one to that bunch br br i haven't seen the original for a very long time so probably i'm not the right person to judge if this straight to video sequel fares any better anyone above the age of seven aren't the right people to see it either perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see lady and the tramp ii adventure and even they would grow up and say it wasn't the best kind of family entertainment they have ever seen i guess to be fair i can say is that it warrants a rental but that ain't much to say br br this sequel pretty much picks up the parts left behind after the original oft called classic lady and tramp now have a litter of cute crocker spaniel pups and one mischievous mongrel named scamp who is a chip off the old block instead of the confines of home scamp wishes to run off with the other junkyard dogs of town unknown of his dad's own past as one of those of the streets to capture the charms of the original this one throws in the same poor dog rich dog love story in vice versa scamp falls for a one of the junkyard dogs named angel and who wouldn't with a name like that and a voice that sounds like alyssa milano que replay of the famous spaghetti scene other than the cute factor there is nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straight to video effort stick with the original br br rating out of 5
<START> un gatto nel or nightmare concert as it's more commonly know amongst english speaking audiences starts as horror film director lucio fulci played by the man himself lucio fulci goes to lunch after filming a very gory violent scene however he orders steak has a horrible vision relating to cannibalism the grotesque visions hallucinations dreams continue begin to affect his mental state fulci decides to seek help contacts professor egon schwarz dvid l thompson for psychiatric help schwarz claims that fulci cannot separate fantasy from reality agrees to help him however schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes fulci thinks he might be responsible br br this italian production was co written directed by lucio fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named lucio fulci which doesn't really feel like a lot of effort went into it anyway un gatto nel is gory if nothing else for that alone i rather liked it the script by fulci john fitzsimmons giovanni antonio is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other italian films it serves it's purpose well enough i suppose to see fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of his or are familiar with his films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling fulci they killed the killer that's it another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence i mean would the police in italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it's own it moves along at a good pace if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you don't like gore then you'll hate it with a passion it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours br br director fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker it shows here as his footage is bland flat looks like it was shot for tv the footage from the other films 7 in total doesn't match the stuff fulci shot it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films if your looking for gore you've hit the jackpot people are dismembered with chainsaws put through meat grinders faces are melted there are a few decapitations there are some slit throats someones body is gorily crushed under a car a tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it there are loads of stabbings someone has their guts removed with a hook there's a rotten corpse complete with maggots someone hand is cut off someone has their head bashed in their eye falls out a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat there are loads of severed limbs gallons of blood splashed around a scene of some cats eating brains there's more as well having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake look cheesy br br with a supposed budget of around 100 000 it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a nazi orgy sequence wall to wall gore the acting in this is terrible including fulci br br un gatto nel is a top film if your a gore hound like me however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you this is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle you'll either love what it does or hate it
<START> i will commend it in only one respect it was innovative innovative doesn't mean it's a good film it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films br br the simple plot is well simple i got to the point where i didn't care if they destroy the building or not if i had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time i swear i would hurl the dvd out the window and there's also the protagonist they try to make him lovable but he's a freakin pervert sniffing the girls bra sneaking peeks at her when she's naked putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps putting her bra on a blow up sex doll which she takes her panties off while hes asleep and slips them on his doll umm br br what irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting in the photo gallery on the dvd you can see what the film looked before they it and put in a color tint digitally too the film looked a lot better without the effect so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy bah i could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap br br i think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good 5 10 minutes this doesn't compare to delicatessen like so many are to do delicatessen has characters you can get into and like these people here just grunt and giggle br br lastly i would also to point out that this was also to be like a german impressionistic film the old silents one of the problems with most foreign especially artsy films is that thety focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the 'space' of the scene it results in the audience not really understanding what s going on because they don't get a sense of the space of the surroundings br br anyway it's rubbish the short film on the dvd surprise was a heckuva lot better
<START> after watching caddyshack 1 i'd heard there was a sequel and decided to look it up the movie seemed pretty bad and i told myself to stay away but stupid me gave in and actually bought the damn thing all the reviews and everything bad you've heard about caddyshack ii are true the movie is simply worn of ideas and the lamest plot and jokes i've ever heard the gopher the acting the whole movie really is bad randy quaid was funny though br br just stay away from this movie as much as you can is all i can really say i deeply regret watching and buying the dvd but not sure which was the worser decision just stay away as much as possible
