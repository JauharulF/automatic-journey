<START> why has ramÃ³n carlos brought his five college mates to a spooky abandoned school building which used to service the black sheep children of wealth that answer might just lie in a diary in his possession supposedly written by his dying father what they come in contact with is in fact a relived episode involving another group of six with five of them presumably meeting graphic fates at the hands of a sadistic security guard paul naschy which occurred 20 some odd years ago but as they seek out a way to escape from this place terror awaits them as that horrifying moment in time replays as the group run for their lives often in states of panic as the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in a various bloody ways will ramÃ³n and any of his pals survive this night of horror or becomes ghosts forever repeating the very same night like those before them br br stylish spanish slasher has that professional gloss and potent shocking violence to match some witty exchanges between the characters layered in their dialogue are pop culture references to american horror films which might annoy some viewers a demented naschy is really ferocious with the kiddies as he attacks them gleefully quite a bloodthirsty maniac who carries out his violent acts with relish i found the loud musical cues a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as reminders to the audience i don't think these tricks are necessarily needed but felt the director wished to communicate in depth with the viewer hence the use of cues and flashbacks a minor diversion for this film's plot keeps moving and the camera follows the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot moments in time relived and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave the twist does seem a bit jarring and abrupt but this might or might not work considering how the story plays out regarding why father is shown amongst those ghosts re enacting those grisly events two decades prior i will say that this film probably wouldn't hold up if scrutinized in detail but as a slasher flick it's a breath of fresh air
<START> this working girls go to hell soap is a time capsule candidate courtesy of its immaculate physical production 50s costuming look at all those bows and pearls creamy johnny mathis theme song and oh so daring for its time sexual attitudes rona jaffe's novel on which the film was based keeps on being and just a few years ago vanity fair actually devoted an article to this delectable bon bon of a movie take a look at the new dvd transfer and you'll know why br br the three leads hope lange diane baker and suzy parker echo the girls from how to marry a or carrie bradshaw and her friends from sex and the city off on a spree their romantic adventures and sexual entanglements are the stuff of paperback passion empty caramel corn devoid of nutrition impossible to resist snacking on lange is genuinely touching in her neo grace kelly way baker is properly dim and idealistic as a timid virgin who gets gasp knocked up by a hiss cad it helps that the cad is played by robert evans the throaty voiced coke snorting film mogul who surely has lead many an innocent young lamb to the slaughter in his beverly hills bedroom br br suzy parker is fascinating in the first half of the film all blithe self assurance and knowing remarks she struts her stuff with the panache of the fashion icon she was in the 50s alas she's not up to where the film sends her into madness and obsession but she exudes glamour and savior faire and her acting is at least adequate one wonders why the critics loathed her virtually driving her out of movies a few years later perhaps an aloof attitude on the part of a good looking woman is just too much to bear it sank ali mcgraw's career a generation later and when you think of it ali mcgraw and suzy parker were basically the same actress br br the film's only major flaw is a weak ending it pretty much collapses into a romantic swoon at the end rather than rising to a wham bang melodramatic finish like the other famous soap opera from producer jerry wald peyton place which had lana turner weeping and gnashing her teeth during a rape trial here hope lange wanders out onto the new york sidewalk spots burly eternally hung over but now of course sober stephen boyd and they simply walk off together into the sunset one presumes otherwise this is pretty much the definition of a guilty pleasure br br oh yes there's also joan crawford breathing fire at all the young girls and smoking cigarettes while she hisses to her married lover over the phone and the titles are done in hot pink with ribbon lettering that recalls the department store ads of the late 50s don't miss
<START> i love the premise but it's replay value is only for certain parts the opening scene of course some characters are a bit outrageous but they are entertaining none the less i think the sh t was pushing it i know it was to show that nick and casey were living foul out in la and to show why casey quit the lifestyle i just think that the story could have been better also the jamaican guy rapping on the phone is clever and entertaining but once again i think the story was told sloppy it really seems unbelievable i actually believe swordfish the other movie woods has written more than some of the parts in thursday because the government keeps sh t a secret all the time and has organizations set up that the public will never know about br br thursday is the best movie i've seen i think woods is imaginative clever and has witt however his work needs more maturation to even to get to the natural born killer script not stone's movie level how old is he anyway
<START> this review took longer to write than i took to watch this film it's just plain bad the plot is terrible in comparison to the tv shows it is flat unfunny and boring br br it is clear that the log ran out of ideas long before this film was green lit viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop br br bad editing bad music bad acting zero dynamism zilch chemistry br br a film that doesn't know what it is made without any love to some mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feeling kind of angry that so much money was wasted br br the log obviously were made an offer they couldn't refuse or perhaps their egos have simply got the better of them it's a bleak marketing push that perhaps would have been better when the log were fresher and more inspired br br i however did know when to stop and did br br please someone try to convince me of this film's finer points
<START> so many great talents were utilized in the best years of out lives the result has to be somewhat miraculous think of what its director william wyler faced in the aftermath of a military victory over powers who had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world if battles he was making a film that argued that the us's leaders were themselves profoundly anti individual that they had wasted the best years of the lives of those drafted or misled into fighting the war which since it ignored the rights of individuals had been for nothing except argument over the degree of slavery men were to exist under there are beautiful sets by julia heron gregg toland's cinematography and a script by robert e sherwood author of the road to rome and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas the ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as frederic march myrna loy teresa wright dana andrews virginia mayo cathy o'donnell and carmichael into a large scale but thematic drama the clever plot line was the experiences of thee couples after the soldiers three being spotlighted tried to return home to a culture their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight again against what was happening on the homefront poses a strong and sobering counterpoint to the conventional notion being sold that all was well with america march and his wife have a terrible time adjusting and he is drinking o'donnell's young man harold russell has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living and worst of all andrews' wife throws him over for a guy with dough and he has lost years causing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job to consideration on his individual merits to have even what he had before he had been ripped from his life and thrust into the arena of risk for nothing and loss of everything he had ever had the shattering climax of the film comes when each of the three has to confront the need to do battle again each for his own happiness and all three succeed in finding the courage to go on fighting each for his own happiness which is now being threatened by a curiously anti self anti reality indifferent an un american united states wyler's direction especially of the scene where andrews sits in the cockpit of a mothballed b 17 alone and the scene of russell's wedding is wonderful indeed this is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms one women and men can agree on for once music by hugo and costumes by irene sharaff add to its luster one of the best and most unexpected films of all time in stunning b w
<START> this oddity contains bunuel like touches but doesn't sustain one's interest a 10 year old roams a bizarro america in a stolen mustang while the usual cult movie suspects dick miller mary woronov susie tyrell commit malicious acts in the name of comedy like his after hours and vampire's kiss the screenwriter delights in making you squirm i remained unaffected due to the broad acting you know you're in for it when meat loaf and flea give the most appealing and what did this kid's screen test look like he's insufferable recommended to the dozen or so fans of sonny boy '87
<START> a trash classic basically what we have here is a story about a couple of american teenagers one male one female both beautiful people of course who seem to be psychically linked in that every time both of them fall asleep they can inhabit each others dreams and express each others innermost desires think mills boon meets x files and you'll be somewhere near the mark actually its more like an unhappy hybrid between one of ed wood's famously bad b movies and a particularly silly episode of melrose place so tacky are the special effects and so amateurish is the acting the actors who inhabit i wouldn't say act in this flick say their lines like they're reading from cue cards and pout when they're supposed to be showing an emotion and it comes as no great shock or loss to the industry that they have since faded into obscurity the whole thing is just a laughably misguided mixture of styles that don't go together at all and the end result is a intriguing curiosity that no doubt will be lapped up by purveyors of so bad they're good films in years to come i'll probably be the only person who ever comments on this film but if you are reading and have seen it please get back it gets kinda lonely round here
<START> the movie is not halve as bad as people want to make you believe it is br br what is the reason why so many people hate this movie is it because it's laurel hardy's last one together and it's not their best or is it because of the lack of laurel hardy regulars or because it's not made by the hal roach studios or 20th century fox br br definitely true that this movie is not a successful attempt to revive laurel hardy and bring them to the '50's it's also definitely true that the movie is far from their best but honestly the movie still entertains well making this movie also far from their worst not the most worthy 'goodbye' movie imaginable but an entertaining and suiting goodbye nevertheless both of them retired from movies after completing this one br br the movie still features some great slapstick moments and the chemistry between laurel hardy is obviously still very much present it also makes this movie better than most of their movies together from the '40's quite a surprise that the slapstick humor still works out as great as it does considering that the days of slapstick comedy had been over ever since the '30's br br the story is perhaps not as entertaining as it could had been and it features too many sidekicks and characters with as a result that the movie looses its focus on the boys at times a shame because they are still the ones that really carry and make the movie br br sad to see in what poor form stan laurel was at the time of making this movie he really looked ill and old which he also of course was he was well over 60 years old already but after a surgery he fully recovered and still lived for another 15 years before dying in 1965 8 years after his good friend oliver hardy br br an entertaining though not perfect goodbye to the boys laurel hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun humorous quality slapstick entertainment of movies that are still being watched and loved by people all over the world br br 7 10
<START> okay that was just brilliant i wish that the rest of season 1 had been this strong it really needed more episodes like this br br the cast worked perfectly even though they were all nobodies back in the day writing was fantastic and so was the editing great job in all accounts br br the episode was thrilling suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end which is what most episodes had tried but failed until now br br the first five star episode for me really good almost like a movie i didn't even remember it being this good i think it's even better than the great horror movie called 'the thing'
<START> i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films i found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour i was a little drunk and tired br br i went to bed and no kidding i had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep i couldn't stop thinking about why so i got up switched the tv back on loaded the dvd and saw the rest of the movie br br well done alex sir you've managed to implant your film into this old cynical movie goers head and that takes doing so 10 out of 10 to you br br i can't say i 'love' this film of yours but it has made a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget etc
<START> blue ribbon banners stars and stripes forever decorated generals and unconditional surrender from the enemies which required tons and tons of radiation this was the summon substance of the united states victory in world war ii the celebration on times square as well as everywhere else in the united states suggests a national zenith america is on top right one thing one agonizing and painstakingly perverse thing the period of adjustment the actual celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished now everyone needs to get on with their lives only one problem though they have to get new lives the old lives are gone forever polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a longevity of ice cubes in boiling water everyone of the characters in the movie is paraded by primal doubts and unable to masquerade a pretense about how nothing was seriously wrong for the simple reason that it was not true once sergeants and generals and their wives and daughters and sons and virtually all other americans touched by world war ii were exposed to disabilities nightmares and recriminations of world war ii and what it really accomplished as well as nobody was the same for now social and moral issues had a self serving interest frederick march and myrna loy had to start over dana andrews realized that he should never have been married to virginia mayo in the first place theresa wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish las but not least the character homer is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as devastated by his injury as he is basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope br br the reason this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending was attained the hard way once everybody recognized the new beginning of the new united states and the new world overall tragedy from wwii was recognized and things that were emotionally torn asunder were taken in stride and dealt with accordingly frederick march and myrna loy need to go back to chapter one in their marriage homer has apprised his new bride as to what it takes to be married to him i e half the times she will feel like a nurse and wright's involvement with dana andrews means that her entrance into adulthood has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriage this is tantamount to learning how to drive a car to get your driver's license at the indianapolis 500 the characters in the movie are the typical post wwii americans in that they are by the rude awakening of changes to their lives happiness no longer is afforded the luxury of the adjective cop aesthetic it is now about formidable conditions and good winning out over evil by way of the less ugly choice world war ii did not just happen it will henceforth dominate the social patterns of american living br br the catastrophe of world war ii has mirrored most americans' feelings of personal human inadequacy as well i loved this film and so did afi probably for the reason that it brought out issues that were at one time unjustifiably taboo bottom line see this movie nightmares about combat dilemmas about marital unhappiness and or coping with your life when stricken ed by a disability and just basically acting human are portrayed constantly in movies and television today however this is 1946 very new to americans then remember that director william wyler has illustrated how americans feel about the aftermath of wwii in the days when the movie industry has left him with one hand tied behind his back take that into account and you will probably realize just how sensational this movie really was
<START> okay to be fair this movie did have an interesting concept given a few script rewrites some decent actors and a budget this might have been a fairly decent cult flick instead of the mst3k fodder it turned out to be br br still it was better than armageddon
<START> new orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in this br br debacle of a film quaid's attempt at speaking with a cajun br br accent by the way hardly anyone speaks that way in new br br orleans is terrible plot elementary and mindless this br br picture refers to itself as a mystery but a mystery involves a br br gradual process whereby a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film there's none of that here big br br easy tries to get by on trite new orleans stereotypes br br don't be fooled the real big easy is nothing like the town br br that quaid barkin bumble their way through
<START> one of the worst movies i have ever seen seagal has been acting in several entertaining action movies but this time this movie really sucks just stupid killing and really stupid storyline in addition looks fat and old
