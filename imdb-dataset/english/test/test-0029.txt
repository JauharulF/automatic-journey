<START> spoilers herein br br where do i begin with just how silly this movie was 'mole sized people living under the garden attacking residents of a big house' when i first sat down to watch this movie i was unaware that the protagonists where not etc but 10 inch high goblins that looked mighty easy to kick hard and far i carried on watching it because i like to see movies through to the end even awful ones this movie was terrible my girlfriend who went to sleep inside the first ten minutes apart from finding it a good aid to sleep thought it was hilarious that i had bothered to watch it all br br tiny goblins even in large numbers the thought is silly i know are about as scary and menacing as flat cola they only managed to trip one guy up and kill a cat before they were blown up the end i did mention it sucked right
<START> similar story line done many times before and this was no improvement br br 15 minutes into this and you should pretty much be able to turn it off the ending was deja vu all over again br br the only morals i could see out of this are stupidity criminals do not equal success if he screwed you before he's gonna do it again
<START> not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you've seen something special 7 10
<START> i've watched this movie after having seen the original spoorloos a few times in anticipation of the chilling ending br br i can't even begin to explain the anger and disappointment that i experienced when the ending came and went and the movie continued to have a happy ending what a waste of time it was watching this us remake br br if you have a choice please skip the vanishing and watch the dutch original spoorloos the suspense is very well built up you feel the frustration of rex in search of any trace of what might have happened to his girlfriend after she entered a gas station and never returned to his car the search takes him three years and when he finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to he must agree to undergo the same thing that has undergone the ending leaves you speechless in your chair
<START> the movie had an interesting surprise somewhat psychologically gripping and the makers could have ended it tastefully without making it just another of a rash of movies put out by hollywood promoting homosexuality and or other sexual deviances this could have ended with a pay off but there were other motives behind the pen what me off is that the mud in your face after you've seen the whole movie like the disappointing the talented mr ripley yeah sure i'm just another puritan this gay content tarnished the whole film i wouldn't positively judge a movie for artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose was to promote an ulterior political motivation more so for this
<START> this work is pretty atmospheric with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements i found this work more rewarding than i first expected given the rotten reviews this receives here at imdb the dialog comes across as natural and honest given the circumstances although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to clichÃ© with the heroines falling down when they should be running and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors typical horror movie fare br br the local characters are some of the worst clichÃ©s depicting appalachian natives as in bred challenged freaks the characters of the children and the principals are great the development given is adequate and scout taylor compton seems to be developing her talents quite well br br now i'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread which isn't all that great by the way but this is interesting and i do not long for my 107 minutes back i would not say this is an awesome movie by any means but there are some really good horror elements herein but there are also some really slow spots where plot character development seem superfluous to the director's or the film editor's whim br br all in all this is good for a rainy night but not so good for a friday saturday night's viewing br br it rates a 7 6 10 from br br the fiend
<START> have seen this movie today very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar the most sad things are br br 1 it's very slow br br 2 how khan cruel and mighty emperor of asia can be played by a kind good actor with warm and lovely eyes during all the movie except one scene br br 3 lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age we see an ex slave without money power friends or home click the very next second he's leading the huge army without any reasons to be a leader br br 4 the magic of khan arise is kindly explained only by the help of one wolf god whoever it was br br 5 can a man make love to his wife that way after not seeing her for years br br 6 is it enough to win the sword fight if you just riding your horse through the enemy lines sitting there with two swords and everybody around you dies does ridley scott know that way br br 7 why after 20 30 years khan's mother doesn't look older br br 8 what is the motivation for the main character none literally br br don't waste your time really work is good the nature is outstanding but the movie cannot be made without director and script the real khan would execute director in a second br br kind regards
<START> thriller is the greatest music video of all time performed by the greatest artist of all time thriller really sent music videos going and other artists have been trying to copy thriller in one way or another ever since it's a thriller
<START> this film is a third rate attempt at a compelling moody thriller and fails miserably on all three counts it just about managed to keep my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had conveniently set himself at the beginning of the film br br but it's in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral a vaguely plausible plotline and that's being generous becomes completely rediculous as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and events are never explained br br this wouldn't be quite so bad if the scripting wasn't so cheesy the acting so wooden despite a strong british cast and the direction so uninspiring this is not an example of good british film making nor indeed should it make tarantino bat an eyelid at least not in comparison to his earlier work br br my advice in this case if it's hard to get hold of don't waste the effort if you're a brit like me and it's in your local video shop steer well clear perhaps head to the video entitled american beauty now that's an example of great british direction
<START> oy vey jurrasic park got corman ized as usual the plot is wafer thin from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs i've seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes and all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film all the male actors are imbeciles thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for of hollywood the raptor itself is the worst thing since the hobgoblins from the movie of the same name it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the motion shots if you want a good movie to sit around and heckle mst3k style this is gold if you want competent film making and good acting don't watch a roger corman film acting gets a 4 out 10 some of the players upon this stage did try story gets a 2 out of 10 it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad special effects gets a 2 out of 10 i've seen worse but not many
<START> this movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver he meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss an obvious idiot a fat boy who never speaks and a woman who rotates between the three of them the group which is called satan's angels wants rod the driver as their personal driver he says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them they rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot missing scene the scene involves the woman walking into the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses on she says she wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show her how she then takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots him the other three in the gang excluding rod run into the store they take everything off the walls and then proceed to play with it like children receiving their toys on christmas day br br this movie surely wastes no precious screen time with a plot
<START> i first saw this film on hbo around 1983 and i loved it i scoured all of the auction web sites to buy the vhs copy this is a very good suspense movie with a few twists that make it more interesting i don't want to say too much else because if you ever get a chance to see it you'll be glad i didn't say too much
<START> my first thoughts on this film were of using science fiction as a bad way to show naked women not a brilliant story line it had quite a good ending
<START> spoilers whatever else can or can't be said about it surface is superbly crafted the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not state of the art conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy and or fx fans close encounters of the third kind by way of creature from the black lagoon with a bit of jaws and godzilla thrown in for good measure say and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting wise either some surprisingly solid casting here this series surfaced seemingly from out of nowhere and by sheer dint of its straightforward storytelling carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season all things considered a job very well done i only hope it resurfaces next season
<START> on one thursday evening at 10 00pm my local west coast abc affiliate aired the pilot episode of northern exposure the abc network usually airs men in trees in that time slot but the program was preempted for a live sporting event br br despite both shows are set in alaska and filmed on location in the pacific northwest exposure in washington state trees in vancouver bc re watching northern exposure as well as few episodes of sex and the city reminds me how disappointed i am with the poorly conceived hybrid men in trees br br anne heche can be a good actress with the right material unfortunately her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in alaska grates on my nerves perhaps because i feel that heche is miscast i am not convinced of her fish out of water character br br i also cannot help but feel that the supporting cast fits the typical quirky stereotypes the hot looking local the kindly bar owner the bush pilot the local police officers the dim but well intentioned radio dj etc br br the only stereotype that may have been broken was teddy bear and veteran er actor abraham as the local bartender in love with two different women considering that one of the executive producers is filmmaker james his movies heavy and cop land had lead characters who were large men then i am not surprised why was cast in a non typical role br br nonetheless i can see why there are a lot of dedicated viewers who love men in trees it fits the quirky niche for television audiences i wished the show could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows
