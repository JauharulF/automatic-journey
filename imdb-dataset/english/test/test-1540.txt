<START> i am a gigantic fan of both koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi but this movie is just not good the reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film i really really wish i had left after that instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film maybe my expectations were too high but i felt let down br br the score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh it was good enough though that i'll still probably check out the soundtrack br br but just keep this in mind if you see this film if you come to realize at any point that you're not enjoying it go ahead and split you won't miss a thing because it won't get any better br br i'll even give the executive summary here warning spoilers lots of shots of athletes that look almost good enough for a nike commercial shots of smiling people inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous people's wax dummies wtf were they thinking here some giggling babies some photoshop effects some imagery that's meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water information money and people i think and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence and then a bunch of stock space footage br br i could remake this movie in 10 seconds here's my pitch br br 2 seconds of a happy daddy with a shaved head and lycra biking shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with string 5 seconds of that scene in network where the guy talks about messing with the elemental forces of nature and how money flows in money flows out 1 second of reginald denny getting brained with a brick and then 3 seconds of alan bean bouncing around on the moon br br there you go that's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life i just saved of course i'd get a copy of after effects and apply a filter or two so it wouldn't look as blatantly stock as it is if steven soderbergh's reading this hey i won't even need much money for this project br br if you insist upon watching a movie about life as war i suggest bowling for columbine instead it may not have the pseudo intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black crowd but at least it's funny
<START> second nature will not go down as one of the worst tv movies of 2003 but perhaps the worst of all time formulaic derivative and every performance phoned in from far far away everyone associated with this project should have a hard time looking in the mirror
<START> it has been a tradition since my first vhs recorder for me to collect several of the incarnations of the old chestnut by charles dickens and i taped this one and christmas this year fortunately when this one was run on the hallmark channel at the ungodly hour of 3 am i was spared having to edit commercials from it this was however it's only saving grace br br the writing was excruciatingly dull with almost no clever scenes to save it from being anything more than a teeny bopper soaper like beverly hills 90210 in this one a good man who was cast aside for her celebrity seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a scrooge like tv talk show hostess it wasted dinah who just plays bitch goddess to the other bitch goddess tori spelling who by the way had more coats of paint on her face than some colonial houses and bill shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise dreary adaptation br br some of the best opportunities are wasted like the entrances of the ghosts aunt entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer but this christmas turkey didn't have one evidently br br tori spelling may be a lovely person but she has all the acting skill of a mannequin and that makes for a bad show all by itself br br yes it was good to see gary coleman work again but the script gives him nothing to do really except roll his eyes and spout truly lame dialogue br br and what is most infuriating was that the transformation from to tori sweet and light is as convincing as a passionate conservative now if anyone wants to write the ultimate scrooge tale of a george bush and karl rove we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad christmas carol clones br br i suppose if you're a fan of ms spelling and or 90210 this might be your cup of christmas cheer i'd prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it down myself this one i just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long time br br god save us everyone
<START> piper and phoebe bring dr griffiths to the manor in order to try and save him from the personal assassin whilst phoebe looks in the book of shadows for a spell to vanquish and piper are attacked by and chase him into the street unbeknownst to and piper they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television with phoebe in the underworld piper and leo must find a way to reverse the damage done leo goes down to phoebe and tells her that the charmed ones have been exposed as witches on the surface piper is shot by a manic witch wannabe and has to take her to the hospital the problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway so has to use her magic on the crowd and they go to the hospital piper is pronounced dead and a swat team moves in leo learns of piper's death and goes down to tell phoebe cole is asked to ask the source to reset time and the source agrees only if phoebe turns to the dark side phoebe agrees but the deal will shatter them up on the surface and piper are battling shouts out for phoebe who unbeknownst to them is in the underworld throws piper and through a wall and dr griffiths out of a window is not pronounced dead until the season 4 premiere episode charmed again part one br br all hell breaks loose is a gripping episode and it made me sit on the edge of my seat sad that dead but happy that there will be five more seasons of charmed my vote 10 out of 10 excellent
<START> five minutes in i started to feel how naff this was looking you've got a completely hero and his overweight fool of a friend seen it all before yeah right i was getting ready to be bored out of my mind for a good few hours this is something i have become quite used to haven't we all then after a few minutes of testosterone fuelled insults and such the truck appeared okay the filming techniques used to make it look fast were clumsy but who cares that truck is amazing soon however that is taken away again and we're back to the geek and his overweight friend but now i'm satisfied that at least it won't be too terrible i then proceed to be amazed again and again by the cleverness of the film there are so many jokes at their expense it's like everyone in the world is in on this except the two of them the mind behind the makeup and effects was a genius i swear it believe me if you are a man you miss so many of the jokes in this film there is so much here that only a girl can understand br br brother bob is by far the best hillbilly killer that can be found anywhere the fact that he's sewn together just adds to the effect there are of course some really dud science facts in here but isn't that always the case when our 'hero' is having a nose bleed and using the blood to lead brother bob to his death now that is rubbish there is no way a nose bleed can be that bad and not mean a severed artery or something i'm all with the use of too much blood but that is taking it a little too far the incest jokes are a little predictable but funny nonetheless and the way brother bob meets his end is more than classic overall this movie rules it really breaks out of the overacted melodramatic strain of horror that we got so much of in 2003 2005 the end of this move simply could not have been better br br this is a definite must watch for anyone who likes their horror with several side orders of gore and attitude
<START> with wwii over movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home the best years of our lives was probably the best example it portrays various people returning home and how they have to readjust not only to their pre war lives but to the overall changing world probably the most interesting cast member is non actor harold russell having lost his hands in the war he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else he went on to win best supporting actor and a special oscar for the role making him the only person ever to win two oscars for the same role there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved best picture more than it's a wonderful life but i certainly think that they did a good job with it very well done
<START> as is frequently the case when manga is translated into live action there is quite a bit lost in the translation however this remains a highly entertaining film the premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet understated style so prevalent in japanese films ha the special effects are a little 70s camp but it adds to the comic book feel of the film i wouldn't recommend this film to everyone but if you are familiar with and enjoyed other japanese horror films like evil dead's trap this film will appeal to you
<START> why isn't this movie on the bottom 100 raptor is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in all of my fifteen years of life i have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done br br nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance the dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous corbin bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing i can't help cringe when i recall some of his lines like in or out you're worse than a cat and your lady friend isn't a very good poker player she's just revealed her hand br br the raptors are a joke even i could make more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers have shamelessly done it is an insult to the actual velociraptors or any dinosaur for that matter not only that but the killing scenes are too gruesome even for me i don't seriously think these animals would rip their victim to shreds and throw pieces all over the ground just to make everything look gorier besides the blood and guts are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away br br i am a big fan of jurassic park movies and of dinosaurs maybe the filmmakers didn't anticipate anybody with a shred of intelligence or sense to disregard bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on hbo late at night like i did if i could say one thing to anybody involved in this film i would have to quote dr alan grant from the first jurassic park br br just try to show a little respect
<START> there have been many excellent comments about this movie and i want to add my voice to the praise yul brynner has never been more powerfully attractive his major was riveting your eyes just cannot leave the screen when he's on it this is his movie this is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary especially deborah kerr and anne jackson as they were mostly stage actors they brought many nuances to their performances for example i have seen this movie at least 4 times but this is the first time i noticed the reaction of the german girl when she came face to face with a russian soldier even though he was not threatening her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in germany after wwii and was most likely gang raped by the red army the possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again please put it on dvd
<START> i loved this movie mark blankfield was perfect for this role more classic sci fie horror films should be remade to this comedy level which is at the very top of the line in my opinion a no drink movie you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself can we expect more let's hope so i would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake mel made some remakes of classic films he made some very strong contributions a picture of dorian gray would be a good suggestion i hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens we are needing a good of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before a good comedy fix
<START> i was disappointed in this documentary i thought it would be about the second chess match between grandmaster garry and deep blue the supercomputer designed by ibm computer experts to beat any human chess player kasparov was and still is considered the greatest chess player ever the movie takes us back to 1997 where had agreed to have a rematch with deep blue after defeating it 1 year earlier but instead of focusing on the game it focuses more on what happens before and after there are snippets of the game but not very many much of the film centers around paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly the movie also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any way they even chat with the manager of the building where the match took place who cares i also found it very dry and slow ultimately this movie was unsatisfying this is just my opinion of course if you like conspiracy theories this movie might interest you for people not into chess or conspiracy theories this movie would probably have no value i am a chess fan and i only stuck it out because of that i give game over kasparov and the machine 4 10
<START> br br this film is a summary of visconti's the decadence of nobility death aesthetic search homosexuality all mingled with melancholic mastery slow paced just to make you to contemplate all its beauty which is in the music and the images as well as in the story this is the type of film we are not allowed to enjoy anymore brave deeply personal and intelligent the genuine fruit of a genius like visconti
<START> this is an excellent suspenseful murder mystery movie not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous ryan gosling for a couple hours what's not to love also sandra bullock is good in this movie i've always been a fan of hers i just wish she hadn't decided to be in the lake house which was horrible but that's another story altogether obviously since there are thousands of other murder horror movies out there there are bound to be similarities between them no need to bash this movie for having some similarities to at least a few that have already been made anyway this is a great movie for those of you that actually enjoy scary movies it's a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie
<START> if you haven't read tolkien's masterpiece prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever if you have however after having read the books several times over many years i have come to love the characters and story and feel i know it intimately i have my own personal vision of the shire hobbiton and the character gallery thus for me the movie was a disappointment why it dictates the appearance of the characters unavoidably it changes events it removes important storyline it removes not so important storyline great chunks of what makes the lord of the rings what it is is simply ignored even 2001 special effects can't do tolkien's and your own imagination justice peter jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible and i don't think anyone else could have done it better but the fact remains i regret seeing the movie the next time i read the lord of the rings peter jackson's limited vision will leap forward not my own
<START> what's the point hasn't this been done before better and again why is werner herzog wasting his good talents and time with junk like this shouldn't he be shooting a movie somewhere i mean a real movie br br it all felt fake from the beginning werner herzog would never have sought to make a film about the loch ness myth at least not on such a small scale surrounded by losers so the plot was not believable from the beginning the actors who are supposed to act like they're not acting were obviously acting the story was not interesting the everyday people requisite in every mockumentary were invisible the personalities were stale the jokes were not funny the effects were unconvincing and the ending was nowhere to be seen br br i just don't see the point it's a fake movie about a fake movie hah hah perhaps if those who thought up such a movie sought to make one that mocked people who really were out to find a real now that could have had some potential but herzog is not a believer and never claimed to be a mockumentary about the crowd would have had so much more fuel br br it was a miss
