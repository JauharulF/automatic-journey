<START> i have watched my fair bit of bollywood films when growing up you know the typical plot boy meets girl girl rejects boys bad guys take away girl boy rescues girl by killing hundreds of and they happily get married of course i've omitted an hour of musical style numbers well going into watch hari om i was expecting another typical bollywood style movie however to my delight it turned out to be atypical and indeed quite comical hari om is what could be labeled as one of those 'off indian films such as the ever popular south asian hits as monsoon wedding east is east or bend it like beckham br br being of south asian decent and having watched various classic bollywood films there was much humour and sub dialogs which could be picked up that reminded me of the fun and charming side of indian culture e g the various indo pop numbers which were actually remade by soni or the witty indian that were used hari om can be enjoyed by all south asians and is also entertaining for those not to the indian humor as the characters and plot caters to all audiences br br in a the movie is of auto rickshaw driver aka 'four for those of you who have traveled to india know played by from monsoon wedding who gets himself involved with a crook and ends up owing him quite a bit of money to avoid selling his four wheeler he escapes serendipitously with and a very charismatic and lovely woman from france camille who herself is escaping the boredom of her boyfriend benoit jean marie lamour who was in swimming pool the movie is of their journey traveling across the beautiful landscape of rajasthan Â the land of love stories through the humour you see the two main actors trying to find out who they are really are br br what made the night most memorable was having the director executive producer main editor and even the mother of ms present at the screening after speaking with who actually has a zoology background many interesting tidbits of the film were uncovered including having the film finished only 10 days prior to the toronto international film festival and taking only 45 days to shoot and having only five actors in the play the rest were all first time real actors arriving home i realized two things from the movie that there is always a human connection between any one of us despite our differences and secondly as the director had put it has a love story' br br its a must see for everyone
<START> this film is bundled along with gli le colt lo and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints first both films are very dark occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening second neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film though il del does seem to have a better dub personally i always prefer subtitles but for the non purists out there this isn't a problem these dvd problems however are not the fault of the original film makers just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later br br as for the film it's about the assassination of president garfield this is a major problem as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield he's missing the beard has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way trust me on this i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes plus using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho he was a fine actor but certainly not a convincing general or macho president br br in addition to the stupid casting president garfield's death was in no way like this film it's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk not garfield garfield was shot in washington dc not dallas by a lone gunman with severe mental problems not a group of men with rifles however according to most experts what actually killed garfield over two months later were incompetent doctors who and and to retrieve a bullet to no avail and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process in other words like george washington who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia he died due to malpractice in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever other than indeed president garfield was shot br br because the film bears almost no similarity to real history it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury why not also include ninjas fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it aside from some decent acting and production values because the script is utter cow crap i don't recommend anyone watch it it's just a complete and utter mess
<START> who'd a thought suicide could be dealt with in a way that's palpable by everyone i saw the film at sxsw at it's premier and it turned out to be the best film there by far yes its warped and it's bizarre but it makes sense in the world the filmmaker michael creates if you didn't laugh most everyone did then you just ain't getting it and thats a darn shame particularly of note guillermo diaz as hector steals a bunch of scenes and the chemistry between natasha and david is intense the film reminds one of harold and maude but not really it takes one bizarre spin after another and they do all make sense in this crazy mixed up world we all live in i stayed as did most for the q a afterward and what was great was hearing that the same things i thought in my head as to why things happened are the reasons they did i don't think you can say much bad about the film unless you didn't get it i think i got it and it seemed like most everyone else did as well the film is dubbed a suicidal comedy but its got a lot of heart a lot of laughs and offers a lot of hope yet it doesn't shy away from the horrors of suicide as well a nice little movie that should get attention when it gets a release which will hopefully happen sooner rather than later
<START> ok about 11 years ago the awesome funny movie the mask came out and everyone loved it and now 11 years later the mask is brought back in this awesome movie right wrong this movie was the stupidest movie that i have probably ever seen i mean when i rented it i thought that i would be laughing so hard that i would almost pee my pants like from the first one but after i saw this sequal i barley even let out a chuckle i mean no offense to the director or the cast of this movie but what a waste of time and money so the plot of the whole story was about this little baby that has part of the mask in him and this evil person is after him for some thing because that is all i really got i would have least added some more things to it so it would be higher than a 2 out of 10 stars
<START> this takes place in 1920s harlem a black owned nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt policemen br br terrible vanity project for eddie murphy it tries to mix comedy and drama and fails at both the comedy simply isn't funny and the drama is boring and badly acted you think a film with three comedy legends eddie murphy redd foxx and richard pryor would be great but it isn't there's nonstop swearing and the opening scene has a young boy shooting a man to death this is shown as being ok also we have the beautiful della reese degraded into playing a madam one of the comedic highlights has a long unfunny and terribly vicious fight between her and murphy a boring offensive and stupid mess not the worst murphy movie but pretty close a 1 all the way
<START> i watched this movie on logo television today i was absolutely enthralled by the powerful messages and plot line within this film i don't want to spoil it i will say this i related to the inner struggle of aaron and his upbringing as a gay man growing up in a small town i related so well to the big secret and the choices i made this movie has made a huge impact on me and i plan on buying a copy of it in the very near future for my personal library i no more than finished the movie and began calling my friends to recommend it it had that profound of an effect on me to those who read this comment watch it try to have as little distraction as possible also keep an open mind this is not a film that can be viewed like a disney film or the movie of the week instead take the time to watch and actively listen to the dialog as well as read between the lines and get involved in the plot you may find yourself in tears not since steel magnolias have i been moved to tears by a film this one did just that thank you to the cast and writer and crew for producing an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion it has been long overdue
<START> your idol will deceive you in this movie stephen nichols is mis cast as a young german student still bending under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years old this makes his relationship a collection of copulation scenes basically to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing the character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe nichols who is one of daytime tv's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie watching him have sex over and over with this girl it's like watching two animals going at it if you're a fan of this actor's talent in other projects don't rent this for you will never view him in the same way if on the other hand you want to see stephen nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera you might like it stephen will show you his naked butt lots of tongue work his groaning range but not his talent as this character who's obviously just as sex driven and misjudging as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera he may have found it kinky but i didn't a big deception
<START> lady and the tramp ii adventure is a cool movie that many kids today can really relate to it's a well presented story about a kid who longs for the freedom to do things his way and how he goes about getting this freedom is only a part of what makes this film interesting just forget the itty bitty disappointments like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a point of view because that's just 0 5 or less of the movie's wonderful effect on the viewer great music lively acting talented animation and directing and a powerful storyline tell a tale of the difference between freedom on the streets of new england and a cozy home with your family and that no matter how bad things seem your family and friends are always there to help you though any tight spot br br i can't wait to get the soundtrack
<START> i suppose this movie is not your typical spanish thriller as it is based in a real story that took place abroad the movie is based in the real story of french man jean claude and the real case is much more gory and scary than the film in the real story of mr the family didn't escape after years of lies he decided to end it all by killing his wife two children parents and dog and although he tried to kill himself it seems he didn't try very hard as he survived i watched the movie with people next to me talking about how it could never happen in real life that all these lies went undetected i was laughing as i had read the book about mr and knew it did happen i like josÃ© in this movie he offered us a good performance as the rest of the crew
<START> well first of all excuse me for the lame pun in the title i was browsing for movies to rent the other day and saw this i heard something about this so i picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review blurb on it from john fallon aka arrow in the head at that moment i thought well if he likes it then i gotta like it so i rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night college keeps me so busy oh and i might wanna add that i read a little of review and it turns out that out of 4 stars he gave it 1 and a half so my expectations from this movie went from very high to iffy well after watching this i once again agree with arrow and turns out that quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about that wow did this film stink or what where do i begin with why it did so well the film was so dull in my opinion not even the cool gore bits excited me and when a decapitation doesn't excite you in a movie that's bad the characters i hated a lot and from the beginning i could tell who would die and who wouldn't actually the film proved me wrong at some points but the worst thing is that one particular character i wanted to die didn't what the heck and the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met didn't feel it he obviously was just there to be eye candy and give her a love interest otherwise i thought he was a waste and as a horror fan i should know that doing the dumb horror movie sometimes gotta happen or else there wouldn't be much of a movie but the ones in here ticked me off hello why are you making out in the room of the killer nun when you should be on the lookout from her and it was done by the supposedly smarter characters no less the twist ah it would have been alright if it hadn't been done a billion times and i didn't have to sit through this wast of film to reach that point my main point stupid movie that sucked me in with some words of my favorite actually my only favorite movie critic jerks
<START> this movie without doubt is the best i have seen and really shows what british talent can do it's effects are exceedingly good considering the movie is set in the mid 18th century and all the grittiness and disgusting filth of england at the time is captured very well the character's are developed and fleshed out from whoring antics to his development into highwayman and 'the gentleman contrast well with robert carlyle who's cynicism and honour show that you can love a thief and a criminal cos i quote got more honour in his little finger than any of you fat bastards ' br br not referring to you of course but it has arguably the most stirring and emotionally charged scene ever witnessed in a movie but you'll just have to see it to find out suffice to say that it involves rope round your neck br br
<START> i went into this movie with very little in terms of expectations i went with my girlfriend and two friends and none of them could explain the story of the grudge 1 to me well if the first one couldn't leave an impression on them to explain the plot then i doubted this one would be any better br br let me summarize what the trailers let you know the asian lady is back and so is sarah michelle gellar luckily for her she isn't around very long that decision may have saved her career br br the movie has three story lines and none of them make sense and even worse none of them are developed you almost start to understand and then someone dies and the story gets left behind okay killing people could be scary but i was left more confused over the attempted plot development than i was frightened they jump back and forth between all three story lines which aren't related or are they sound the timing of the three stories are displaced and you can tell right at the start that the movie is going to have a twist at the end be oh wait sorry this isn't a fight club or vertigo quality twist you could see this one coming from miles away and probably envisioned a much better twist in your head they should've hired me instead of the girl making her surprising appearance maybe it could've been michael jackson instead that part of scary movie 4 scared the crap out of me br br the killing sequences were terribly done unlike horror movies of the past where a killer pops out of nowhere a closet or behind a door for example and everyone in the theatre jumps and subsequently the fat guy behind you spills popcorn down your neck this lacked any frightening pop ups they zoomed in on where the random asian woman or kid would show up and you knew exactly what was coming instead of having the music get really loud then quiet then a pop out to psyche you out the music actually gave you timing for the scary scene if i know it's coming it won't scare me br br the movie began with explaining what the grudge is when a person is killed during a fit of rage a curse is placed on the location where she was killed so why does the asian lady being cursed by her mother have any significance to the story and why is the grudge now moving countries this movie was absolutely terrible br br all it did was leave me begrudging my friends for making me go we should've seen one of those animated pixar movies it would've been scarier
<START> this belongs in their top tier although there were others such as micro phonies and punch drunks that were more deserving of oscar nominations than this one but if nothing else the recurring loudspeaker announcement dr howard dr fine dr howard followed by curly's woo woo woo woo makes this a classic on two levels first it symbolizes all that the stooges represent my daughter loves to repeat the announcement when she is in the middle of doing something silly second the absurdity of these three as physicians in a hospital i imagine the terror i would feel if i were a real patient in a real hospital and heard this announcement over the loudspeaker throughout this short you hear that announcement and you know that something horrible is about to happen and the loudspeaker voice stays with you for months afterward
<START> besides the comments on the technical merits of the production or lack thereof the acting is absolutely horrible what is really scary about this movie is that i actually own a copy of it of course it was in a bargain bin and had been renamed as dark harvest 2 and after having seen it i can understand why it was in the bargain bin they should have paid me for taking it out of their inventory br br the majority of the movie if you want to call it that is spent by a frantic father running around a corn field maze looking for his daughters because he has a premonition that something is going to happen to them i suspect that the camera that the girls were playing with at the beginning of the film was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco in the maze he runs into the ghost of some children which are poorly done and the movie goes horribly south from there br br i can see why they renamed this movie otherwise they would never have gotten rid of them absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever had to sit through and it wasn't worth the 2 i spent on it
<START> one life stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasn't been given the credit it deserves its imdb rating of 1 7 doesn't do it justice and is perhaps due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself shot on digital in black and white the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget the performances are excellent particularly that of gary lewis who gets better with every role my only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments overall though it is a fine piece of work
