<START> for the record i am a curly fan through and through but i do have to say that in reality shemp wasn't really that bad yeah he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that curly had but in his own way he was hilarious at least he wasn't as bad as joe besser br br in brideless groom shemp plays a music professor stooge a professor yeah right who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle and moe larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six o'clock that night or no money br br this was one of the stooges' first skit with shemp before they started recycling their material perhaps it isn't surprising that shemp was part of the stooges before curly came into the picture so he seemed natural at this the slapstick gags are hilarious especially this one scene with moe and shemp in a phone booth essential stooge short to be honest
<START> the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing a few of his credits in later years this must have been one of his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his head was he on drugs i was looking forward to this movie just because of oldman bacon maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to bang it out i can't imagine that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote oldman bacon along with the rest of the cast must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening as one poster pointed out karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with bacon she really did 'let loose' it's unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really don't have anything more to say about this uninspiring film one does not have to be forced to be a when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique
<START> i always loved that scratchy voiced guy in all those westerns he was the sidekick jingles in the wild bill hickock show back in the fifties in this he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful bragging character he is harmless and no one believes him but he is non flustered and goes on anyway when you have a guy like this there's no challenging because the details aren't there to quibble with of course in this episode he is taken on board a space ship by a group of aliens who have no sense of humor and believe everything they hear they don't have the word lie in their as it turns out he is so insufferable that they can't handle him and then of course there is the secret weapon see this just to watch andy
<START> this film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts even little things like flynn licking one stamp after another when he almost certainly would have used a sponge is one of the annoying things flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder he is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody and he did not end up on skid row in sydney he did not get his role in in the wake of the bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well dressed film star br br this is just a mediocre film where the name of errol flynn has been tacked on just to sell more tickets and more videos
<START> fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in ww 1 br br at first he goes to boot camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line that's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight br br next thing you know he's in france in a trench hilarious scenes here include a starving charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder br br when charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring this is such a funny part i can't really describe it just watch the movie when charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to 'wake them up' it had me rolling on the floor when it turns out his second leg still feels numb while charlie actually rubs his foot br br the movie then turns a bit grim as charlie shoots a couple of germans from his trench although it's done in a very funny way and him as a tree to get close to the enemy saving a friend of his from a death squad br br last part is him getting a french girl in trouble by hiding in her house he then has to save her and while doing so he captures the german kaiser as well to do so he impersonates a german or something i love it when charlie is asked something in german and he's like the soldier looks at him in a funny way so charlie changes his mind ja ja ja the kaiser gets captured and charlie is the hero but then he wakes up again in it was just a sweet dream br br charlie did one of those 'dream before the bank comes to mind but who cares this movie was so funny it had me laughing all the way chaplin also has something to say with this movie as his later work became more of a social comment to several mishaps in the world and is explained best in the last sentence of the movie 'peace on earth good will to all mankind ' br br in short a charlie classic very funny timeless 9 10
<START> david cronenberg movies are easily identifiable or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks fetishism the blurring between the organic and squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing is classic cronenberg briefly it's about a future generation of computer games but instead of a video monitor visuals are supplied by your mind the game plugs directly into a in the base of your spine and while the game is running the player can't tell reality from game jennifer jason leigh plays the game's developer guiding a marketeer jude law through the game's paces while in the game they uncover strange goings on and possible crimes but are they real or is it the game not even the game's author knows br br the movie is quite a treat keeping the viewer engaged but in the dark until the final minutes another thing i like about is that it doesn't use a heavy reliance on special effects it's the story itself that propels the movie recommended for the saturday night when science fiction is called for
<START> this movie is a shame especially considering is not an amateur but professional director however this movie fails to deliver anything you could expect br br first of all i am polish so i can tell all the background story because i read books but how can you tell there is even a war from this movie bunch of people are going back and forth some soldiers are shouting this is really the second world war or soldiers are on vacations br br acting and dialogs poor miserably poor a d m w kowalski a fit in their roles the rest of polish cast is out of the place most notably m one of the leading characters what an unfortunate choice 99 of the dialogs are not spoken they are just put there actors had difficulties to perform and it is no surprise considering what odd things they had to say br br and this leads us to the most disappointing issue you can't feel it everything is so theatrical artificial there is no real life there is no feeling in it there are a lot of original footage from the wwii and guess what the material is much more powerful dramatic than what a did br br i can see only one positive despite historical mistakes like acronym it was made for post 1945 propaganda purposes to please polish that was gone and now there was but in 1940 there was no luckily it is undoubtedly shown killing in katyn was done by soviets yes it is a fact not some controversial gossip great two hours for 5 10 minutes scene br br anyway time and potential wasted this is tragedy of epic proportions will to fight in 1939 barely shown not declaring war against soviet union by polish authorities sic not shown here imprisonment of soldiers shortly after living in the outrageous conditions not shown here hope and fear what will come next barely shown and then extermination hand to hand with germans soviets were exterminating polish nation aimed at people who constituted the backbone of poland unfortunately they succeed and the results are still visible to this very day
<START> i can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining in my case i at the time this film was released was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film for me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years while some of the pranks that takes place in this movie like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road strung up in the trees or out on a lake are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not when i went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin as i grew older i realized these night raids to the girls cabin that i participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time i thought it was real and it was fun that's what meatballs mb is br br mb captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree mb give a great example of pre teens teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high high school and college the opening title song that goes are you ready for the summer no more homework no more books no more teachers dirty looks describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids br br i personally enjoyed the two campers spaz and fink what boy nerd or jock didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper what guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors while these two characters are somewhat over the top i bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys these two characters are a mix of charlie brown from peanuts and jack larry dallas from three's company i would bet that most viewers even cheer for spaz in the egg carrying competition and for fink as he attempts to beat the stomach in the hot dog eating contest br br lastly this movie had normal looking kids and counselors no super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing it is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie
<START> this is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film total reality don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film this is without peer the single worst movie that i have ever seen in my life i had nightmares of this movie ever since i saw it the acting was terrible and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film the film blatently rips off far superior sci fi films such as timecop or total recall where the title seems to have been derived from i'm sorry but i just think that there is more entertainment value in watching the side of a cardboard box for two hours if you already have seen this movie i feel sorry for you for going through what i did
<START> a finds a young cougar in need of help to young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers nicknamed good time charlie' his antics amuse everyone at first his wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and reintroducing him into his natural habitat becomes an issue this film is among those wonderful disney nature films that were common in the 50's and 60's lots of action beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you these films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into wildlife and the effects of human contact unlike disney's animated talking animals the animals in these films remained true to their own nature they also make great travel films for seeing the western states
<START> this was perhaps the worst movie i've seen in a long long time forget that it's clear no research was done regarding detroit forest in downtown detroit the writing was horrible the premise completely implausible and quite frankly the characters were embarrassing i cannot for the life of me understand why seasoned actors would stoop to such a low and participate in something this god awful now i have never seen the original and don't know if this movie pays tribute to it's original form it's my understanding that the original was not set in detroit why they would deviate from that without researching details about the setting only tells me that it was more than the cast that was looking to pay the rent br br don't waste your time on this junk unless you're from detroit and wish for some comic relief
<START> the story of a little girl who was driven once by fear and now by pain she becomes woman and a vengeful crime fighter her power is to manifest strong anime characters onto herself this movie fuses animation with live action as she wields her animated sword through all that stands before her she struggles to deal with life her demons and her fears br br young emily watched her parents fight and argue she watched her dad leave her emily soon discovered she had the power to do something about it emily grew through life traveling as a loner and at night she had the power to make a difference in the world br br this movie is a great blend of animation and real action there are many themes and metaphors that run deep through the movie this movie is broke up as a 12 part series
<START> this one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and peta wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere subplots come in and out of nowhere the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killer's motivation is unclear to say the least maybe they could get away with this in a porn version but here some more clarification is needed
<START> i just rented blackwater valley exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying and i don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto dvd but this looked so interesting and scary i was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about just look at the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose both terrific movies that made break throughs not only horror wise but story as well br br blackwater valley exorcism is about a girl isabelle who from the get go is automatically possessed so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with but a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener i know i know then they go into several other stories with the priest and isabella's sister and the priest hit the sister and messed around with isabelle i'm not sure then we get into a story with isabelle's dad and his questioning of his wife's faithfulness to him br br i mean the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all not to mention that the exorcism didn't seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film which i didn't like at all because i couldn't take it seriously whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well so i wouldn't really recommend this br br 2 10
<START> the inspiration for this film was the fact that american gangsters are well dresses but the aussies well when you might kill a guy as soon as look at the blighter then you can dress as badly as you want and people won't criticize you br br jimmy is fighter an illegal boxer sometimes bouncer and is offered work by the local gangster boss in the cross that is australia's notorious kings cross district not the cross of london fame as many a british finds out the hard way br br due to feelings of love he stuffs up a job loses a lot of money and has to get it to before and his heavies can kill him br br lots of dark humour interesting action revelations about the australia's underside and human nature it is very centred in the australian nature and explores the nature of australian criminals versus the american and british ones br br one problem is that each of the elements of the story don't have enough substance and depth but it is a painting with broad strokes that covers a lot of area not covered previously so as an overall package it is worthwhile br br team it up with chopper and dirty deeds for your aussie crime fest or lock stock and two smoking barrels and miller's crossing for an international falling short of the criminal gangs fest br br by the way bryan brown is a great actor who has just done a huge number of really bad movies here is one of his great movies
