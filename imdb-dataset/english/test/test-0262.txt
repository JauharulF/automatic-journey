<START> if i had never seen an episode of the original avengers with blackman rigg or i would have appreciated this series more while the cast did its best to sustain the action and interest of the scripts i was just caught up in comparing the episodes to the original series there was an expectation of steed participating more in fight scenes and the continuity seemed as though the writers were struggling to keep up with the actors to be honest i can't blame them for trying to resurrect the fans from the original series but it just didn't work as evidenced by the fact that it lasted one season watching steed labor through this series reminded me of gen macarthur when he said 'old soldiers never die they just fade away '
<START> this 1950's howler is so bad it's unintentionally funny tom conway portrays dr gerard a scientist who is turning natives into a monster using voodoo his poor wife played by mary ellen kay is being held captive by her wacko hubby who has no time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him along comes marla english as a greedy murderess who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle her idiot boyfriend portrayed by lance fuller is along on the safari they hire touch connors later renamed mike connors of mannix fame as a guide english is a terrible actress but hey no one else in the cast were turning in academy award winning performances either touch i'm sorry i can't even type the name without cracking up i mean what the gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and that's saying a lot the monster is only seen briefly and the ending is predictable to say the least i would say this movie falls into the it's so bad it's almost good category of movies it's good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the tube
<START> i can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was reflecting the apathy of adolescents this was before generation x br br in a way most of us are products of the same consumer culture these high school kids spend their time drinking getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbank br br what would they do today would things be different some very important questions there are some excellent scenes with keanu reeves and the dysfunctional family he lives with his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted the mother has no idea what to do spends her time drinking with her boyfriend br br this film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class american society these kids had no outlet what is available for them in this dirt water town all in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented and there are no solutions 9 10
<START> a brilliant horror film utterly gruesome and very scary too the thing is a remake from john carpenter but please do not let that put you off this film it is simply brilliant the start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'the thing' one of the best opening credits for a horror film ever br br the cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their station in is visually impressive on dvd widescreen it must have been great in the cinema i regret not seeing this on the big screen br br kurt russell is excellent as macready the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection it is tense scary and finally spectacular i love it because its funny as well br br special mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself if he didn't get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have this is also debatable as to whether this is john carpenter's greatest film its certainly a gruesome masterpiece br br wait for a cold winter night get some budweiser from the fridge sit down and watch the thing a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime br br utterly brilliant br br ten out of ten
<START> i was looking through tv guide last night and saw a movie starring heather grahm on who i liked in movies like boogie nights and austin powers so i decided to watch it it started out ok but you could tell the story was lacking and at about half way through it started to deteriorate i do not remember this movie being in the theaters and i'm sure if it was it wasn't there long the acting was stale and unconvincing the dialogue was silly and predictable and the story was confusing and stupid definately one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i like movies like the ones this has been compared to like fight club but this one doesn't come close heather grahm has done much better things since i gave it a 2 out of 10 but thats because i clicked on the wrong number i meant to give it a 1
<START> sickening exploitation trash plays like a bad and reverse death wish ripoff but the ugly and untalented makes charles bronson look like al pacino with her performance as for ferrara's stylish direction when a film is so vile dumb and deeply offensive it's hard for the viewer to pay attention to such details
<START> in this movie virtual sexuality the 17 year old justine is not lucky in love one day when she is stood up she goes with her friend to a reality conference there she is introduced with a machine that can change your look dody and whatever you like in virtual reality she decides to try it out but begins to make a boyfriend of her own her then suddenly there is an explosion in a gas pipe and her creation comes to life i'll say no more you'll have to watch the movie which is quite fun to watch
<START> alright let me break it down for ya haggard is probably one of the funniest pointless movies you'll ever see it's got a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy having girl troubles and everything going backwards for him mixed in with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the whole movie basically if you've seen jackass or the series you'd know what to expect for humor considering it has most of the people from those movies overall i just had to give it a 10 10 because its one of my favorite movies of all time br br br br p s haggard rules
<START> robin williams shows his stand up talents and boosts up his status as a comedian in this movie of what's wrong in american politics and how can hollywood try to make an influence without boring people of course hollywood uses movies with hidden or not so hidden agendas i think this movie is for people who likes stand up and political discussion and the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this everybody knows hollywood is more liberal democrat than the bush co so they have to make these movies every now and then but this one was perhaps too obvious at least i thought so for making any real change br br still great stand up and fresh political issues and talks i enjoyed it and thanks to imdb com ratings i was positively surprised when i walked out from the movie theater and yes i laughed many times sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness see this movie if you like good and clever stand up or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now rent it if that doesn't match you
<START> i adore hedy lamarr i think she was vastly underrated as an actress during the 40s she was the nastassja kinski of that era and critics didn't take her seriously having said all that this film is a bore when i watched it for the first time i was shocked at the lack of continuity not only in story but in makeup and costumes hedy's makeup changes from shot to shot so does hair length and style reason this thing had so many writers and underwent so many stops and starts it's amazing they ever released it at all her lady of the tropics began filming after this one began yet it was released before i take this woman in fact at the time it was known in hollywood as i re take this woman that should tell you something i'm a spencer tracy fan as well but he is awful here i've read in various film histories that he absolutely despised hedy lamarr and that looks perfectly obvious on film no whatsoever the story wanders around for reel after reel and finally just rolls to an end very strangely i can't recommend this one at all
<START> maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after conan o'brien and late night's fans are all of a sudden unsuspectingly watching carson's show carson daly can't hold a candle to leno letterman o'brien or any other late night talk show host and last call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre the shows only redeeming quality is that it's so short but i wouldn't call it crap carson daly is sincere and doesn't hide the fact that his show isn't great that honesty is actually helpful here while some of last call's skits and material seem to be stolen they still find the mark sometimes actually some of carson's montages have been quite entertaining and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy br br as an interviewer carson is okay even with only one guest not exactly late night material but still above the level attained by a high school av team however he doesn't have the quick wit that makes conan so hilarious i do not like his musical guests but that's more because i am not a fan of that kind of music so i'm not holding it against him br br on to the house band i don't know joe band and wouldn't compare them to the cbs orchestra the show band with kevin eubanks or the max weinberg 7 even and the are better but band mates do still the show in my opinion especially the alto sax player that sometimes shows up he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register if anything watch the show for him i do br br in summary this show isn't even worth a full bag of n' bits but it does have an audience and appeals more to the younger mtv generation if you don't have cable and are up at 1 37 am there really isn't much more to choose from and surprise surprise there is worse out there in that time frame so if you're waiting for poker after dark to come on 30 minutes of last call wont kill you during the wait
<START> went out with my friends and saw this movie last weekend here in london we didn't know what to expect the poster gave some of it away and i won't say any more so as not to spoil the plot but we found it to be an excellent film with great acting convincing plot and scary as hell having done some research on the making of the film i have to hand it to those guys the filmmakers actors writers etc for having put together such a film with such limited resources post production very well done too for all of that i give them a 10 out of 10 and i hope they will continue their fine work keep it up guys you rock
<START> ich will herr den mein deutsch ist nicht gut br br first of all i didn't know how diverse the sound of istanbul inspite i live in turkey faith akin and alexander have made a different approach for turkish music narrating performing seeing istanbul and istanbul music from a foreigner aspect had given the real meaning of the music itself br br in this movie i had found out how different our turkish culture is how interesting our performers are and how much respect they deserve unfortunately no one have been able to serve this kind of documentary before
<START> saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids a bit predictable the book was better gave more plot details ore about the environment and how the kids uncovered the conspiracy i think warped humor comes across better in the book than the movie but there were lots of funny moments in the movie as well it is probably a bit too slow paced for kids under 6 yrs of age loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher and those baby owls were adorable i wonder how they managed to film them the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing am i imagining it or did the author carl make a brief appearance
<START> donald pleasance and peter cushing united in one horror film that always sounds like a terrific plan two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like the flesh and the fiends and from beyond the grave pairing up in a mid 70's satanic themed exploitation flick how can this possibly go wrong well unfortunately it can to my deepest regret land of the minotaur can hardly even be called mediocre and that in spite of the cast the exotic setting the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise in a remote little area in greece more particularly near an archaeological site multiple tourists vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire breathing minotaur statue cushing who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns that is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists when three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area father the priest of a couple of towns before decides to investigate land of the minotaur is a boring and extremely slow paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn't bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details the titular minotaur for example is an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance instead the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises the only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of donald pleasance his portrayal of rude bossy and old fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always
