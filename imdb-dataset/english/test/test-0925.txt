<START> i'm a big fan of the vacation franchise and i love randy quaid as cousin eddie and at least a couple of the behind the scenes names were involved in this project most notably simmons who produced or executive produced all 4 of the theatrical releases as well as animal house for those reasons i figured this made for tv spin off might be worth checking out even without chevy chase br br for the record i did not expect it to be very good i just thought it might be a slightly amusing diversion therefore my high level of disappointment goes to prove just how bad this utter turd of a movie really was it was mind numbingly jaw droppingly heart stoppingly head terrible yet somehow i could not stop watching it it's a sickness i have i can't seem to walk out on a film or give up on a tv show before it ends nothing has ever made me want two hours of my life back more than this movie
<START> i caught this movie on late night tv honestly i saw most of it and the whole time i was sitting in complete and utter disbelief br br is there any genre that's more pointless than soft core porn if there is i don't want to know about it softcore porn combines all the horrors of porn lousy production values abominable acting crappy scripts with the of sex scenes in regular movies so the end result is arousing nor entertaining this movie also has the rather odd approach of a science fiction setting and it works horribly all the sex is performed in some sort of virtual reality setting where the crew from the future learn about physical love and yes it's about as confused and silly as it sounds br br but there has to be some positive points though right well there is one krista allen is amazingly hot that's about the only thing that was less than awful in this movie i don't know what it is about her but she has an amazing sex appeal the rest of the cast look like the standard porn cast though rather unattractive women with poorly done fake breasts and men that have spent far too much time in the gym toning themselves grotesque probably a gym in germany as well judging by haircuts and clothing br br to sum things up if you enjoy krista allens presence on screen you can watch this for the brief moments where she shows some of her seductive potential most of the time she tries to articulate crappy lines of dialog though if you don't enjoy krista allen then you might as well stay away altogether br br i rate this 10 10 for krista allens sex appeal 1 10 for everything else and 2 10 for entertainment value since this is a unique crappy porn science fiction hybrid that's not really like anything i've ever seen
<START> talk about over acting not just by govinda but also by salman and lara the direction was awful the first half hour you would pretty much want to switch the movie off because this movie is a real stinker mark my words br br i liked govinda in some o his comedy roles like haseena jodi no 1 se maare and desh mein hai and this does not compare to any of them and salman khan should not do comedy roles at all he sucks he does not know how to do comedy the only good comedy role he did was in which was brilliant next to amir khan br br there were so many done stupidly scenes in this movie that make you want to take out the dvd and burn it so no one else in your house watches it ever again
<START> i smiled through the whole film the music is great the story telling is great it's a wonderful film this picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties
<START> dorothy does the opposite here she keeps growing and growing i didn't detect any subtext though the incredible shrinking man and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation nuclear war and other horrors growth is the result of an inept computer robot br br and who operates this computer but lou costello i like some of his movies with bud abbott but though this is a pretty bad movie he does fine without him and gale green is an excellent foil br br green plays the pompous town big shot he is father he is intent on being elected mayor so when his beloved daughter starts having issues he dumps her he doesn't exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer costello br br this is pretty implausible costello is the local garbage collector br br the special effects are minimal and the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme
<START> i really don't know much about the marquis de sade not having read any of his book but i never imagined him as a flaming queen carson of queer eye for the straight guy or jack from will and grace would have fit easily into the role that nick mancuso gave us br br the movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody or an excuse to show the paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor what they can't afford a room i did find it cute that the madame irina felt she was doing her patriotic duty taking care of the soldier's needs br br the movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts and i mean a lot fans of gimli john rhys davies might be interested in seeing him in a different role as inspector marais
<START> this film has haunted me since i saw it when i was about 8 years old i didn't know what it was called so am so pleased to have tracked it down finally i remember being quite scared because i'd just been to a tin mine in cornwall when i watched it so could imagine it all fortunately i didn't see any ghosts of dead children there but i found this film really quite disturbing and scary when i was much younger i've certainly never forgotten it even though i couldn't find it anywhere i seem to remember the children's film foundation films being generally good but they don't show them at all any more i also remember programmes like the children of green in the same era on bbc equally unsettling in its own way
<START> although this movie has a slow dream like almost mesmerizing pace and an interesting though possibly not entirely accurate description of a rural french criminal investigation practices and personnel i find it ultimately impossible to recommend i think this movie is simply a setup piece to advance one person's the director's one presumes disgust with heterosexuality certainly human sexuality in all its forms can have their revolting moments no denying that but to choose the bad uniformly at the expense of the good as this film does at every turn suggests a warped sensibility at work in short if you enjoy watching homo eroticism masquerading as compassion and the depiction of heterosexual lovemaking and the female form in a hideous and degrading light then this movie is for you i don't and it wasn't
<START> well how can i categorise farscape without resorting to gushing superlatives ok here goes the scripts are fantastic with each episode offering so much entertainment drama humour and sheer watchability the casting is perfect especially that of the blue lady played by virginia hey each character has a depth that just isn't there on the star trek series br br i think having an australian spin on the show makes this for me australia has been knocking out quality films for years and farscape is no exception br br i have only seen the first four episodes in uk order and they have a quality that makes each 45 minute show in the uk stand out more like a film than a weekly tv series br br the episode that really does it for me is 'i which turns the alien concept around where a living ship even the spacecraft has a great character is forced to land on a planet that has yet to make 'first contact' and is surprisingly earth like and crichton meets a radio telescope operator and he is the 'little green man' to them gripping stuff br br in short the effects are great the scripts are top quality and the main characters not one of them really given any more importance than any other are interesting not always 'good' and well just excellent br br roll on the second season
<START> anthony quinn was a legend of 20th century in cinema by his great roles obtained this movie about a policeman innovated a false guilt for toni to rape his beauty wife but he failed in this trap because he faced the strength of but he succeeded in his trap which was prepared by him for toni that he put his name in the list of jewish people in romania and he transported from country to another in east europe br br this movie was directed in 1967 at the time of arab war in 1967 six days war as an evidence of harmful works from jewish people which were caused by jewish people not only in europe but also in the rest continents br br jewish people were a great cause of french revolution in the revolution in russia 1917 the turmoil of different countries in any time br br pearl buck wrote a novel in 1948 at the time of occupied in 1948 about chinese jewish people and their problems they faced in china because of their bad instruments they used in these countries as keys of crisis
<START> it has to be admitted that the best work of harold lloyd ended with his last great silent comedy speedy in 1928 after that he enters sound films like chaplin and keaton and laurel hardy and w c fields and does do better than keaton but not as well as the other three chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as producer but he paced his films so there were five years between productions laurel hardy were under the protection of hal roach so production standards for their shorts and sound films were pretty good fields first worked with mack sennett than with paramount and then free lloyd tried the route that chaplin took but with less success br br he produced his own films but unlike chaplin he did not own his own studio also his first two choices were not good especially feet first but he did begin to choose more wisely and movie crazy the cat's paw and the milky way were all good choices these three and possibly the sin of harold were his best sound ventures they are all entertaining but none are up to safety last the freshman the kid brother or speedy br br of the top four sound films the cat's paw is the most controversial ezekiel solution to ridding the city that elects him mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005 or is it when a movie is made dictates what it's politics are the cat's paw is from 1934 that second year of the roosevelt new deal itself rather controversial for heavier government involvement movie audiences saw films like gabriel over the white house and the phantom president where our leaders did extra constitutional actions to rid the nation of internal enemies and to force disarmament around the globe even cecil b de mille got into this act with this day and age where a bunch of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes br br to us the use of violence to force anyone even a bunch of goons and like alan gang to confess is repellent after all the supreme court has protected us from confession under duress what we forget is that the reforms we are thinking of did not occur until the warren court and the burger court made them for example although mr justice sutherland's opinion in the powell scottsboro boys case of 1932 guaranteed every criminal defendant had a right to counsel gideon v wainwright did not extend this to ordering court paid counsel to defendants until 1962 the miranda case with it's now well known anti self warning is from 1963 nothing like this were considered necessary in 1934 br br if you study other movies of the period up to 1954 and even to 1960 tricks are used to get confessions kirk douglas confesses his crimes in front of witnesses in i walk alone while burt lancaster holds a gun to him when lancaster leaves douglas sneers about confessing under duress only to see the gun is unloaded suddenly he realizes that legally in 1948 he has confessed without duress hate to say it to any civil reading this note but what cobb lloyd does to and his pals in the conclusion of the cat's paw was not only legal but would have led to their jail sentences in 1934 we may call it heavy handed fascistic or horrid but it would have worked legally when it was thought up
<START> german and uber actor paul muni who never saw a scene he didn't want to chew up goes blackface to play a humble mexican immigrant living in los angeles and working his way up in the world if this creaky vehicle reminds anyone of al pacino's minstrel performance as an uncultured cuban in the remake of scarface don't be too surprised the characters are quite similar and both get wildly pop eyed when the script calls for it hispanics everywhere should be greatly offended by muni's over the top performance as this giddy mexican living the american dream consequences be damned i guess benicio deltoro's grandfather wasn't available a young bleached blonde bette davis plays one of muni's love interests she eventually goes insane for love of mr meh hee can muni an absolute hoot davis is the sole reason to watch this racially offensive claptrap there is an absolutely delirious near the end when muni asks the gal of his dreams to marry him a white gal of breeding with one of those stilted stage like '30s accents that hollywood loved so much and she calls him a savage and a brute of a different tribe muni immediately transforms into mr hyde and chases her to an untimely death in the final scene a repentant muni tells his sober faced priest that he is going back to his own people his own kind end of movie finis that's all she wrote muni was said to have hired a gen oo mexican as a chauffeur in order to study this exotic creature's speech pattern and physical habits yowza
<START> first things first though i believe joel schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often as here downright bad the lion's share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to john grisham whose novel this is based on br br set at an undetermined point in time the 50s the 70s now the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by rednecks so caricatured that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that at least we're not that bad Â cut to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls father samuel l jackson fearful they will get off on some technicality guns them down in cold blood before the trial br br the setting is a 'deep south' that probably never existed the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton the dyed in the wool racists kiefer sutherland is a cartoon version of a are laughable in their villainy the set piece is the trial for the defence are the good guys a milquetoast lawyer played by matthew mcconaughey as though in a coma his assistant played by sandra bullock's breasts she doesn't seem to serve any other narrative purpose and donald sutherland as the requisite drunk lawyer who sobers up to fight the good fight for the prosecution kevin spacey goes through the motions of being demon spawn while in the town at large crosses are burned witness are intimidated and the local citizens don't seem to br br some of the reviews here claim the film immoral since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble heart tugging piece of oratory by matthew mcconaughey to be honest objectionable though the underlying message vigilante justice is good might be everything about the movie stinks the characterizations are pitiful the acting leaden the direction plodding the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody peter menzies lush 50s technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative br br and it goes on for nearly two and a half hours br br what's left to say this is a waste of minutes of anyone's life it is tedious vacuous and hammy and almost as an afterthought it is morally repugnant
<START> i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls his performance as awarded was stunning the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop roeg proves again it doesn't have to be a war setting to be in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast and beauty go hand in hand while loneliness should become your best friend it shows a more sinister past of a small golden age kingdom which lands on a coast full of wealth for a 1st world country if u send the right men all in all a beautiful directed film from roeg a sublime cast
<START> when i heard there was to be an abc australian broadcasting corporation mini series based on life in wwii pow camp with a focus on elements of comedy i was deeply sceptical and somewhat critical br br my father had served in the second world war such was the of the japanese he was able to talk about the horrors in and around where he was stationed until only quite recently along with my father i had been awarded the fortune of knowing many great men of stronger character and spirit than i shall ever have who had witnessed acts of unspeakable at the hands of the empire of japan and had never completely recovered the name is destined to conjure horrific images for ages to come br br but upon viewing i was highly impressed with the cast the characters and the complex plot lines of this wonderful series i now regard as the highlight of my week bear in mind i have viewed only three episodes so far i hope the remaining episodes adhere to the standards set by the first three br br the black humour works uncannily well however the flatulence jokes are a little overdone and while much of the horror has been suppressed the series comes quite close in relaying the spirit of the survivors who were able to later continue with their lives in spite of the memories br br the format of this series will be difficult for some to follow br br but i can not think of no better way to do adequate justice to the men who suffered deep emotional scarring proceeding when painfully suppressed experiences are remembered sometimes years after the horror br br one of the darkest chapters of the second world war the 20th century and i would go so far as to say in the history of mankind is being relayed to a new generation through this series and i hope it serves to relay the overwhelming adversity borne by the wartime generation br br proceeding i don't think i shall ever be able to listen to the poignant tune 'on the road to in the same way again tune in
