<START> spoilers more than likely nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves yeah it's really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but you know they're basically the same thing br br the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time even when screaming wasn't really necessary he'd let out a listen up now block the door with cars and so they'd run cars head on into other cars but then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn't want to come over to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tv's in a studio i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes i hated it good day
<START> while it's not perfect it's close love barbara stanwyck sidney greenstreet dennis morgan robert shayne superman's police chief the housekeeper the waiter at restaurant felix and the judge i can go on and on this movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since i was a youngster and my children grew up with it too the baby swallowed the watch was always my son's favorite line br br sexy barbara stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly funny s z dennis morgan has a few great songs too br br i highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake blah
<START> call it manipulative drivel if you will but i fell for it sure there could have been more character development yeah there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant movie of the week score but ed harris was impeccable cuba gooding adorable and touching and let's face it people in real life how many of us really get to know the motivation of others not many we did get a little glimpse into the coach's motivation a very provocative dialog in my opinion not to be soon forgotten so in my opinion this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his comfort zone to reach out to another human being and in the mean time touched the lives hundreds more a lesson we all need to me reminded of why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart you won't be disappointed and bring your kleenex 8 10
<START> cant believe it after all these years finally tracked this down it was meant to be named 'the great at production stage i was living in oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming it was me that showed these guys how to speak scottish and after all this time i only realise now one was russell crowe it has taken me all these years to track this down was even unsure if it ever went to screen as i left oz the following month after wrap up party at that time russell crowe was not the demanded actor he is now and i had no idea it was him until i saw the previous comment then thought back to the days during filming amazing truly delighted with myself now
<START> i felt that way when i saw the episode in its original run and still agree when i watch it on reruns you had the culprits totally mocking columbo throughout the episode and treating him like he has down syndrome and in the end you see their shock when columbo gets them dead to rights and arrest them you also get a realistic reaction from the arrogant preppy killers they give columbo his props and say he just got lucky i like the formula where there is an elaborate crime the killer s totally underestimate columbo and then you get their realization that columbo was totally playing the criminals i recall in the first few episodes of the post 1989 episodes they weren't following that formula and this was the first episode that i was pleased with
<START> pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror science fiction and suspense films there are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and donald pleasance and nancy allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious movie horror helps us deal with real horror you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre and pretty trite also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring and shown out of context these bits aren't very scary at all and it's real short i saw it in a theatre back in 1984 and was outraged that i paid 5 00 for an 84 minute movie br br still it is reasonably well edited and allen and pleasance seem to be enjoying themselves for people who have an interest in knowing more about terror this might be fun and interesting but if you're a horror fan like me you'll probably be bored silly good idea bad execution no pun intended i give it a 3
<START> just exactly how director john madden come to settle with nicolas cage and penelope cruz playing the roles of an italian officer and a greek villager in an honourable story captain mandolin just escapes me witness a wobbly inconsistent accent by cage amid horrendous over acting with cruz more adequately cast as a spoiled latino opposite johnny depp in blow in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a greek nurse it was painful but there were saving graces br br the story itself is thrilling to tragic and cage does have some redeeming this is musical ability next a superb performance by john hurt father the village doctor of oscar as well as by irene papas each as village elders as well as by christian bale son among the village freedom fighters go far towards counter balancing awkward performances especially at the beginning by cruz and cage nicely the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses but itÂ´s teeth gnashing early on finally the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed br br john hurt already has two oscar nominations and this would be a third i hope he gets it as his performance as the doctor makes this film worth seeing the true test of a supporting actor actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question and in this case it would most certainly not be not even close br br entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar see it if you havenÂ´t rating 3 5 stars of five
<START> i can't believe this terrible film was made by the same people who made gore watch that and skip this the plot is muddled and the characters are mostly two dimensional stereotypes i suspect the editor went on vacation halfway through the film because quick choppy cuts start to appear that only confuse matters rather than elucidate them the ending doesn't make sense either br br this is predominantly a propaganda film made so serbs can feel sorry for themselves and vilify america for the nato bombings of 1999 they do this by perpetuating lies about serbs being our allies during wwii claiming the whole world is unjustly against them and completely ignoring everything said and done by slobodan milosevic like waging war on three neighboring countries they seem intent on making a political film but only show a few seconds of milosevic on a tv screen with no sound a nationalist agenda obviously any consideration of art which was not the case with br br regrettably i recommended this film to a teacher when it played last week at the seattle international film festival he also cited the bad editing and confusing plot and i had to apologize for the bad advice you've been warned
<START> i must have seen a different version than the first person on the user comments section br br it's really really good steve and karl urban are great together val kilmer's character is much like he was in the novel although the emphasis is on gus and call and the we get to see what happened with call and mother as well i won't spoil it but it gives a lot of insight into call's character br br all the actors did a really convincing job steve had the biggest challenge i thought to follow robert duvall there's a lot of action humor tragedy it's got something for everyone i can't wait until it airs my family are all jealous i got to see it early
<START> you know the movie could have been a lot better when the animal in this case a little dog is the best actor on the screen the acting in this film is so bad so amateurish by dog got embarrassed watching this he rusty our golden could have done a better job than the people in here br br by now this is almost a trite story kid finds animal pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the pet winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family sound familiar br br i remember this movie being a big hit but never got around to seeing it until the mid '90s on vhs i was shocked how bad it was why so much fuss over a film was it because there was so much sleaze in the early '70s that a nice family film stood out in the crowd possibly there wasn't a whole lot of wholesome entertainment in the decade of the '70s plus a lot of people are suckers for cute little animal stories who could resist this cute little dog not me but the movie i can resist it's a grade b storyline with horrible acting br br recommended only for small dog animal lovers and i mean lovers because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this film in this day and age
<START> i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible i've been to the scottish highlands and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try le dernier combat there have been very few movies that i couldn't even manage to finish and this was one of them absolute dribble
<START> apparently this australian film based on novel exists in more than one form beware heavily cut versions sometimes shown on cable or satellite running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours only the full 5 hour miniseries version tells the story properly it is a very close realisation of the story suffering only from editorial faults commonly found in tv movies and episodic progression but this excellent cast carries the story forward very well with generally good production values accompanying their work yuki is notable as mifune one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their agonising trek in the end he becomes a friend you will agonise with him when his loss of face leads him into death helen morse as jean paget pretty but not a great beauty she resembles sigourney weaver a bit registers just the right amount of spunk and as the occasion demands the miniseries properly emphasises the beautiful love stories three of them joe and jean noel and jean and jean and gordon jackson plays noel appealingly but as a somewhat younger man than indicated in the novel the third love affair i mentioned doesn't get quite the emphasis it is due and the full significance of the title is diminished jean is devoted to the goal of bringing businesses to that will attract young women and girls and their influence to this god forsaken out back town she wants to make it a town like alice alice springs that is we get only a few hints of this in several scenes if you have the five hours to spare this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience based his novel about the cruelty of the japanese military in a large group of women and children from one place to another on the peninsula on a true occurrence it happened on sumatra according to though rather than on the peninsula the crucifixion of joe by a japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably fiction but the cruelty of the japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record
<START> i happened to catch this on community tv a few years back and was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable a film it was br br while a bit corny in certain ways as its prime function of being a mystery thriller it works superbly thanks to a script that concocts an ingenious plot it kept me guessing throughout and the resolution is inspired br br the cast is a star studded one containing a mixture of those at the end of their careers indeed richard long died the same year this was made or those who were on the verge of stardom in hit tv series kate jackson tom bosley they all do a good job with the exception of cesare who sleepwalks through his role br br strongly recommended
<START> this movie was perhaps one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films i've seen in a long long while to be fair i was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula but i was anticipating to at least be entertained with such low expectations how could i manage to be disappointed br br jim carrey possibly my favorite actor not sarcasm did little more than tread water in this film he seems to have temporarily returned to his funny face making roots and created a character no different from his fletcher from liar liar this new character dick harper a k a fletcher 2 0 is a poorly rendered and miserably written if you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character it is most likely because carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him carrey's outlandish posing becomes humorously awkward and ultimately sad br br tea leoni as jane does little more than provide the abbott to carrey's costello i typically find tea leoni refreshing and underused but not in this case jane harper could have been easily played by any actress from age thirty to forty five and it is in that non specificity that the character of jane becomes uninteresting to watch she simply has no defining trait other than her following of the movie's general theme which seems to be that wait no this movie has no theme unless you count big business is evil as a theme i thought that was more of a given br br richard jenkins and alec baldwin both deliver believable though tired supporting performances but neither man seems truly invested in the role they're playing it's very clear that alec baldwin was putting about as much effort into playing his role as the sinister c e o as he puts into eating a sandwich which he seems to be doing a lot of lately br br slight tangent but has alec baldwin played any roles in the past few years that hasn't required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit br br anyway take my advice if you haven't already witnessed the horror for yourself save your money this is the one to catch on hbo in a few months dick and jane are present but there's no fun to be had
<START> this is probably the second best of the death wish movies death wish 5 is the best one br br death wish 3 reminds me of west side story with a new twist not even the recent flick gangs of new york can measure up with one new york neighborhood in death wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs but one big gang a gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set br br deborah raffin who plays a public defender plays gently in this action packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot em up violence so like nichols in death wish ii death wish iii scores with its gentle romantic moments as well as its violent moments only the james bond love interest scenes would do much better br br and in addition to his 38 plays with this new gun called the 475 magnum it reminded me of the dirty harry movies when callahan used his 44 magnum in magnum force sudden impact and dirty harry the gun packs a big punch and when kills with it he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it br br and that missile that killed off the main gang leader well that is something would not use an missile as his regular vigilante weapon that is way too military for him
