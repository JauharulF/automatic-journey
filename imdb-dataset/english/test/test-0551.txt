<START> i had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as i was perusing the shelves at a local rental store having just watched the latest harry potter installment i was intrigued by rupert and wanted to see more of his work reading the description on back about an overzealous evangelical christian do gooder and identifying as an evangelical christian myself i thought should be interesting and so it was i found mr brock's story beautiful in both words and images and sadly enough all too familiar the contrast he drew between ben's parent's interpretations of what it means to be a christian was a poignant commentary on how christians view themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them on the one hand we have ben's mom stating whatever happens behind these walls ben we're god's ambassadors we show the world a smiling face on the other hand is ben's dad discussing truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film at the end of his monologue he states the more a person parades their christianity for the benefit of others the less i am inclined to trust the christianity they claim god tells us true faith is the freedom to choose truth now how you express that the way the manner the means at your disposal these things are of no consequence be you christian or atheist unless in your heart you are true if only our churches were full of christians who to this latter definition of what it means to be a follower of jesus rather than the former what a difference that would make as a christian and a psychologist i would want an imperfect yet authentic faith over a perfectly polished image any day what a tragedy Â to feel like i always need to play a role when really i just need to rest in the freedom of being completely who god made me to be i think mr brock provides a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom in christ looks like i recommend this film for anyone who desires a fresh look at faith
<START> this was a nice film it had a interesting storyline that was executed pretty well in the later part of the film the storyline kinda reminded me of the city of god but this one is done in a more nicer way in comparison it had what i really loved a tinge of surrealism some pretty interesting cinematography thru the wooden camera i'm not sure if it was culturally correct but it definitely widens you're view of south africa the actors were good for 1st timers most of them anyway i especially liked estelle character which made this movie pretty enjoyable what is interesting though was that it makes you ask about your own life are you really doing what you really love or do you consent to the norm the around you definitely worth a watch
<START> i went to see this movie to kill some time i remember cole hauser in tigerland and although his acting is wooden he does portray a tough leader character same here this movie was about a bunch of young hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in romania that one has to dive to see the beginning scene was very interesting with a bunch of romanian or russian men exploring the cave in search of booty flash forward 30 years and we have a team of divers called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose br br there is a lot of clichÃ©d useless talk the women are too hot for their jobs let's face it i hate to watch the lips of these women talk about the guys while drinking beer at the pre cave exploration party i mean it was like we were at some bar with frat and sorority types talking about the opposite sex not a group of scientists and divers every character had zero personality with perhaps exception of the scientist who at least wasn't one of the young and beautiful people so the acting although workmanlike was not inspiring br br the dialog was pretty bad at one point in the movie cole hauser jack the lead diver his irises morph into the wireless symbol and stay like that we are led to believe that since he was scratched by one of these monsters that he is turning into one of them fair enough but first of all nobody says the obvious thing to him what is up with your eyes dude no everybody just talked about how he's changed and that he should not be the leader of the group anymore and then this guy says you see how he's not human huh if they really believed he was a friggin' monster then why not act like it instead the group splits in two those who go with jack and those who go their separate ways i guess thinking him to be a monster it makes no sense br br the best scene in the movie was this blonde diver woman crawls up a cave wall and gets attacked by this goblin her scream really sucked but she fought like hell to dispatch the goblin br br the photography was fine when the camera was still but any action sequences the director found it useful to confuse the hell out of us by flashing bubbles flashlights dark space god knows what i wish they would just show us a scene straight once in awhile just because you move the camera all over the place doesn't make the movie any scarier folks br br this movie could have been a lot better if the following changes had been made br br 1 every actor was replaced by someone who looked real let cole hauser be the lead it's ok to let him be the good looking one i'm getting tired of seeing 20 something supermodel scientists give me a break people br br 2 the cinematographer was fired and replaced by one who just pointed the camera and sat still this could be the director's fault i don't know jumpy camera as in constant gardener is getting old folks br br 3 we got to see the goblins actually devour the people how bout some gore there's not much else in this movie we barely got to see the creatures i felt a little ripped off about that br br 4 the ending was pretty lame during the denouement the sexy british scientist has a secret guess what that is it's a bit canned the ending would have been better if they all died instead of the black guy morris chestnut who seemed to breathe a little sympathy into his character just by his worried expressions all the other actors had no expression br br i gave it a 4 out of 10 because after all the acting was without noticeable errors and the concept was fairly original i'd like to see cole do more military roles he's good at it
<START> i have to admit i had never heard of this movie i caught it last night on tmc i thought it was hysterical i laughed so hard and loved the ending image what a marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with dali and x and then all dropped lsd br br funny and edgy are two overused words these days this movie sure has that plus about 200 iq points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot i had to be up at 6 00 am and watched it until 2 30 i over slept and missed my obligations still worth it i would not recommend renting it i would recommend owning it it was that good br br the only warning i have is that so of the references are dated and might not be gotten by younger people bare with it and use your head br br i would have to put it in my top comedies of all time
<START> i hadn't planned on leaving a review but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie i had to say something br br i'm not going to give away the ending or anything but i do give away some important plot points in this review so you should be aware of that the short non spoiler version of my review samuel l jackson and geena davis both kick butt in this movie and it's a lot of fun watch it br br this movie is one of my favorites of all time geena davis is perfect as the action heroine torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother and the memories that are resurfacing of her former life as a cia assassin her performance is superb as she plays both facets of this relatively complex character perfectly br br samuel l jackson's performance is as always also excellent as the private investigator that geena davis' character hired to look into her forgotten past he does a great job of playing the unwitting sidekick to geena davis' tough character some of the lines he utters in this movie are the best he's ever used in any movie he's been in br br seriously if you haven't seen it do it's a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists and turns and it's extremely well directed and acted
<START> stripes an army training camp comedy starring bill murray and directed by ivan reitman is a favourite of mine meatballs a summer camp 'romp' starring bill murray and directed by ivan reitman is a complete waste of time it takes a considerable effort for four screenwriters to produce a movie the word 'comedy' a work with mirth as witless anaemic and boring as this br br murray evidently reached the same conclusion during filming but his usually reliable powers of improvisation escape him and his flailing attempts to inject life into proceedings just add to the embarrassment the it really doesn't matter chanting scene is excruciating it doesn't help that the supporting cast is bereft of talent the funniest thing about them is their hair but then meatballs was made in 1979 and introducing chris makepeace as rudy announce the opening credits no not the chris makepeace br br mercifully reitman rectified his mistake two years later for stripes murray's shtick is so much funnier when he's larking around with the likes of john candy warren oates and john larroquette ditch this and watch that
<START> this is a masterpiece 'the big is a crazy weird hilarious and eventually touching look at an old married couple and their quiet life who argue over sawing and scrabble while a nuclear war rages on outside everything in this great animated short stands out as memorable the eye shaking of the wife the binge the husband's saw fetish keep an eye on those backgrounds the very verbal cat the demented game show the informative news anchor the beautiful accordion serenade and the moving and memorable ending i am so glad i found 'the big which is hands down one of the greatest works of film ever produced
<START> again such kind of zero budget digital video cam trash and again i fell into this trap cuz the title had zombie in it german title zombie attack the story on halloween some people visit the museum of the dead it's a trap a crazy doctor wants to kill the people everything connected to some aztec cult so they fight against some zombies in there br br ultra cheap scenery some corridors with black tape on it a few dilettantish drawings and a few skulls as you can find them in every fun shop no actors just low grade models waking around with absolutely no idea what to do no effects laughable make up your local hobby make up zombie fan will do it better some time it looked as if they had not enough money for enough colour otherwise they just could not do it like this man they have to realize the looks of their zombies some laughable martial arts fights with the zombies slow motion just when the director wants to have it scary he uses some standard digital video cam effect where everything is unbelievable 0 out of 10
<START> family guy has to be my all time favorite cartoon it is definitely the funniest tv show ever made and is better than the simpsons i have never laughed so hard at a tv show in my life the things that make the show so funny is the plot characters and themes that are dealt with in the show there are very few themes that have not been dealt with on family guy br br i have seen just about every episode of family guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons my favorite characters are peter because he is very funny and is the best character of the show my second favorite character is because he is the funniest villain to be on a tv show if you love family you should check out american dad because it is just so similar and is created by seth mcfarlane i hope this show never ends because it is a comic genius 10 10
<START> l'appartement is i think a very purposeful hitchcockian film the plot was rife with symbolism ie the white and red roses and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly the look was very parisian and pulled you closer to the story i saw it in london and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states
<START> i saw house party 1 3 and i loved them but this one wasn't funny at all first it can't be a house party movie without kid right this one sucks and it was more like a black version of ferris bueller's day off than a house party movie second who the heck is john john these new character's can't even compare to the ones from the other three movies now i know why they put it straight to video it has horrible music weak plot untalented actors and no hilarious jokes at all my advice watch this movie at night only if you can't get to sleep they should have ended the series after house party 3 since separated after that one i hate this one am glad my local video store doesn't have this film and never want to buy it or want to see it on comedy central either just because chris strokes has talent managing an up and coming r b group doesn't mean he has talent directing and producing films am i right or what finally the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two dollar hookers throughout most of the flick separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays in terms this movie just plain old sucks
<START> i'm a boorman fan but this is arguably his least successful film comedy has never been his strong suit and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done still it's almost worth seeing for boorman's eye for talent this is one of uma thurman's first starring roles and as always she is ravishing to watch on a sad side note boorman wrote the script with his daughter who died a couple years ago
<START> mild spoiler in the second paragraph br br anna christie was garbo's lackluster 1st talkie she and dressler look like the only people who know what they're doing in this movie the old guy who plays garbo's dad george f marion in the film is soooo ah all he does is stumble around drunkenly in a totally fake way and yell about dat old dah sea he blames garbo's past his whole life and everything on the sea he comes across as stupid x 10 charles bickford is matt the rough 'n' tumble sailor garbo falls in love with and he's fine in his role but nothing really outstanding br br the best part is when garbo unleashes her terrible secret on bickford and her dad finally marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and beats his head and fists on the table in perfect time with bickford then soon he goes on a tirade about the sea br br i had to practically force myself to finish anna christie it's too melodramatic in many parts and creaky there are many good early talkies but this is not one of them if you haven't seen garbo before try something else before anna christie like camille or grand hotel
<START> starring tomas and manny perez Â heights' is a low budget drama set in a latino neighborhood in nyc br br a young comic book artist manny perez wants to escape his latino neighborhood when his father is crippled by a robber's gunshot the young man is forced to run the family bodega br br the movie was shot in a budget low resolution video and poor audio with low profile actors br br the plot flowed well for 85 minutes but the last 5 minutes were just terrible we don't know for sure if perez and his girlfriend remained together and if angel ended up in jail for the shooting br br 4 10
<START> i think this is one of those few movies that i want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment br br i haven't seen this movie in about 25 years so i really can't say that much about it it still seems to be very hard to find on video but i remember my brother and i stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night uhf channel television of the mid 1980s when i was about 10 years old so i've never actually seen the beginning of the movie but i saw most of it the first thing i remember is this couple is sneaking out of a campsite and they're rowing to an island to make out and then they get attacked by an insane scotsman in a kilt with an axe they manage to escape from him but get attacked by the loch ness monster which in this movie is just a head and a neck with no body the eyes and the mouth of the monster don't even move it looks like a br br i mean i had just literally never seen anything on this magnitude before and it totally blew my mind i had seen some bad movies on tv in the early 80s but i had never seen something so totally inept and so casually and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed like the people who made it spent less time and effort on it than we did watching it i had already seen some of the troma films and that type of thing that tries to deliberately be campy but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with truly great bad film making this movie was like the last gasp of the drive in era and i caught a whiff of it just in time actually when we were watching it we couldn't figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s turns out it came out just a few years before i saw it br br later i came into contact with mystery science theater and found out about a lot of the old b movies and serials but i had already seen it in this movie the movie is so funny that i had never even laughed that hard at the monty python crew or bill murray or any comedian after seeing this movie i was always trying to search for the good bad movies and i got a lot of my friends into it but this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find i never really found out what it even was or who larry buchanan was until the 1990s when imdb took off and the internet took off and information started getting passed around but this movie still needs to be discovered by a lot of others who might appreciate its bad qualities look for it
