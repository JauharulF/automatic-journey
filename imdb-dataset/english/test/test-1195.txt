<START> the viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be wildly missing the point here this is a superb movie excellent and realistic portrayals of a middle class jewish family in brighton beach brooklyn of long ago the nuances are perfect and i felt the casting of everyone was superior i especially found the acting done by judith just perfection especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night that scene was oscar worthy but really all the acting was fine i recommend this movie it is a fun family film and delightful to see how a lovely middle class family lived in brooklyn so long ago see it and you will be glad you did has some very funny lines and the eugene character is a real comedian very funny
<START> anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say fake it's never been disproved also is a weak argument saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved although to be fair it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in no bones of any primates are have been found in the united states or canada there is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother studying this the same argument goes for the loch ness monster ghosts and god
<START> i was truly and wonderfully surprised at o' brother where art thou the video store was out of all the movies i was planning on renting so then i came across this i came home and as i watched i became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud the coen's have made a film again but i think the first time you watch this movie you get to know the characters the second time now that you know them you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you i strongly would reccomend anyone seeing this because if you are not you are truly missing a film gem for the ages 10 10
<START> a tedious effort from not yet great director budd boetticher and pretty but not yet un bland actress nina foch this movie is as one of the other reviewers notes is the quintessence of a certain kind of b movie it's just not the good kind and a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted br br basic plot nina a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves has a nightmare she meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a breather and realizes he's in the dream even though she's never met him before meanwhile it turns out our dashing guy is working as a spy and is about to go on an extra secret hush hush mission that must not fail br br of course there are nazis and plot holes and smart people acting in a fashion most likely to get them into entirely unnecessary scrapes so that the running time can be spun out past an hour at the end the movie becomes a contest between which group of spies can act more foolishly if the fbi and oss had acted like this crew we'd have lost the war in '42 br br the movie itself is rather flatly shot despite the best efforts of the fog machine and the acting as it seems to be in many of the columbia bs tcm has been showing lately is curiously unengaged it's less stylized than what one might find from a similarly budgeted warner bros movie but also less fun to watch br br strength of course is a rather matter of fact style which allows the strong stories and acting in his randolph scott westerns to come to the fore maybe the problem here is that such a style is not going to work when the script is lousy and the actors tired from their five film a year schedule
<START> my question is what was the worst element of this movie was it the acting directing script maybe it was the waste of alan ladd and jack larue larue and especially ladd are capable of bringing extreme sinisterness to a role in this movie it was hard to tell who the bad guy was granted ladd was playing an undercover good guy but even in his good guy roles he could be very chilling so the net result was a potentially good movie bereft of any feeling of conflict
<START> this movie is hilarious bright and insightful though perhaps the story would work well involving almost any ethnic group the inherent of the characters gives extra meaning to the bounty of wonderful dialog there were so many social issues covered in the plot that for that reason alone it would have been worth seeing but the real treasure was in the warm laughter that spread throughout the appreciative audience the medley of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses play out their roles with all the pathos and humor one would expect from the shakespearean drama their lives seem to parody this is a film about family about the often fragile sometimes invisible binding together of diverse personalities and lifestyles first among siblings and parents and inevitably among the larger family of friends and even strangers the technical aspects of the film have given the movie a pace and development that keep the viewer intrigued until the final scene peter falk is amazing as always in his role as family patriarch morris strong performances by a fine cast include a surprise guest don't miss this movie
<START> currently playing at the 2007 german film festival in australia http www goethe de ins au lp htm thanks to and especially for her rundown on the actors in this ensemble cast br br in australia these movies were sub titled in english and while french movies here often get a mainstream release german movies are still to gather that sort of commercial audience but like bmws and mercedes when germans get it right i really like their films like the time here went so quickly lots of laughs from the audience as each of the 9 men and 9 women moved down the speed dating line 5 minutes at a time br br while many films are overlong this one i could have watched much more of it had the sort of characters and character development for a series given time i will re read review and reference the actors i liked and their other work with a view to keeping an eye out from them i agree most of these actors will go onto bigger and better things some very good character actors in this fine film i did see it in the program listed as a mockumentary mock or otherwise it felt very real and quite romantic in it's way br br viva la
<START> in the same way lamberto bava was a substandard of his father mario who was an extremely overrated director anyway michele is a substandard director in the dario argento mold the church has at least one thing to recommend it the incredibly detailed art direction but absolutely nothing else the film is long winded filled with one dimensional characters and almost put me to sleep several times there's a fine line between 'art' and crap ' and while the church isn't completely worthless you'd be better off watching something else br br 3 10
<START> a traveling couple horton and hamilton stumble onto the town of where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more along the way they're separated and peter horton of course must save his wife from these tiresome er terrible tykes in this very bad adaption of one of king's best short stories in the original story king managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful also the effective ending used in the story is in favor dumped for a happy ending which makes the overall impact mute there is some atmosphere and stylish directing but no plot to back any of it up the kids are woefully unconvincing also br br 1 5 matt bronson
<START> never had i seen such a powerful true story movie i discovered a city a country a lost revolution and even a nobel prize winner thanks to this masterpiece of cinema br br if you haven't seen this movie you can't say you've seen anything br br a great lesson of courage humility and life br br i haven't seen anything as good since br br t e saturday january 9th 1999
<START> in the year 2000 keep in mind this is two years ago not four two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of art on this side of the mississippi br br thanks to cunningham and tom flynn the world can now enjoy second string a delicious tv movie depicting a tale of a rag tag gang of second thus the title who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters br br because of the motivational direction of both the director robert and the buffalo last minute dan give 'em hell heller portrayed by canadian actor gil bellows the oft super bowl snake bitten bills find themselves in the ultimate position br br with an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict a love story comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring and an overall theory that the underdog can compete second string is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on tnt br br the only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the costume designer's first name jarvis br br
<START> too bad i really like kristen cloke and gary busey but the director failed to put this together there's a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off hokey the director didn't do his job promising action comes off lame so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film this version of the rage directv credits it as 1996 simply isn't worth the time to watch it another director would have done a better job
<START> the movie is made in a style that resembles lock stock and two smoking barrels with lot's of subplots fancy camerawork cool music and that great tongue in cheek aussie type of humor you'll find nowhere else how this movie has escaped the european and american audience is a mystery
<START> i've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise a christmas classic it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s the story line is simple elisabeth lane barbara stanwyck makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine at christmas time her boss alexander yardley sydney greenstreet asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the connecticut farm she write about the only problem is she hasn't got any farm and she can't cook to get out of the jam elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend reginald gardiner who has a farm and flies for connecticut with her wonderful cook uncle felix br br there's a fine direction by peter godfrey and the cast is really wonderful stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman greenstreet gardiner and make hilarious and human supporting characters the only weak point is the leading man dennis morgan he starts well but as the movie goes on becomes really a bore one almost feels sorry for lane to ends up with him rather than with gary cooper or david niven who both would have been more suitable for the part anyway this is a joyful christmas time movie with a refreshing score and i advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet holidays in connecticut
<START> this film is utterly amazing from the performances of huppert girardot and to haneke's screenplay and direction there is not a single misstep the film may put some people off with it's hard sexual subject matter and with it's slower pace but it really is a masterful piece of cinema so do not let it's challenging ways keep you away br br powerful and deserving every award it won in cannes
