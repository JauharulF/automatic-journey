<START> there was absolutely nothing in this film that hadn't been done better in a hundred other films it was barely worth the trouble of watching through to the end even the bad language sounded tired tom mccamus a very fine actor was particularly disappointing here
<START> the word boring gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low budget horror movie might or might not be i've seen many a b movie many horrible terribly inept b movies some with a production value of a few hundred bucks does ineptness lousy acting worse continuity and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable some would no doubt way yes most of which are probably huge fans of the matrix well i hate big budget movies so i say no bad can sometimes be funny blood freak sometimes even mind blowing troll 2 but boring will always be unwatchable hey kinda like bloodthirsty butchers which reminds me i'm writing a review for this pile of garbage uh yeah anyway this is one of late british director andy milligan's many alternatives to sleeping pills this one is based on sweeney todd great milligan takes a boring story and still manages to butcher it hey that's pretty funny i said bu sorry i keep getting distracted this isn't exactly easy on second thought i'll make it easy no gore no scares no entertainment just unlikeable annoying people having incoherent conversations that's bloodthirsty butchers oh yeah and something about a barber killing people and something or other about meat pies i don't know it's not important br br for something a little more rewarding from andy milligan there's always the only other one i've seen the rats are coming the werewolves are here yeah you heard me but hows about we forget about this milligan guy all together and pick up something sweet like sick girl or goes to camp whatever you decide just know bloodthirsty butchers sucks possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale and that b movie fans is really saying something 2 10
<START> set mostly in the back streets of toronto ng is a dark mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman vern and sarah each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past fine dialogue and first rate casting propel this low key noirish journey into the girl's search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life aided by her anything but enthusiastic male friend the two of them reach the end of their quest but with a price to be paid the film never intends to answer all of its mysteries but does an excellent job in the exposition of several plot twists
<START> i saw this movie with my girlfriend it was a total disaster you can really see it was cheaply made badly scripted and with very bad acting i have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book we couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained the experience of watching this was like the blair witch visits green acres then there were parts that were vulgar they show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it the witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs i thought it was nasty and very strange i really can't understand why someone would think that would be entertaining it shows another scene where dr arrives and betsy bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother how sick the little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body disposes of wastes begs for toilet paper and goes to the out house and makes these sickening faces of joy with sound effects i think they should have left all of that out the makeup on the reverend james johnston as a older man didn't really make you assume he was older it made you think he was dipped in fish batter the blood on joshua gardner when he falls from the ladder is even worse the john bell death scene looks like they got out flour and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man to me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture these people would do better if they film commercials for local tv stations for bathroom products they chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner i rate this film capital f minus
<START> i love you i could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending my family has not seen this movie yet but i know them too well they will hate it but this time i watched it alone and i found that it affected me greatly although the movie is long in length i was tied to the story and amazed by the ending i initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished but on some level it makes perfect sense br br but like said this movie does not make sense of reality instead it challenges it and the viewer to think strongly about what the word normal means it also gives you the insight to personally think about what the ending means i can say that i loved how it turned out and i'm happy for
<START> sometimes things should just not be made and while the set up seemed good enough it proceeds to only make the audience gasp in horror but the problem is its not another saw film its just so bad you wish you were receiving punishment from jason voorhees br br i lost track of how many sports movies and spoofs it incorporated into the film and generally it flopped in its attempts true telling his team they should fail every subject to be true players was somewhat funny at first but that grew tiring to watch that and the joke about radio and ipod br br overall i can't stand to watch this film again even is worth more than this d
<START> terrible adaptation of low key love story an american soldier rock hudson falls in love with a british nurse jennifer jones in italy during world war 1 what's wrong with this virtually everything hudson is way out of his depth here he could be a good actor but not in this movie jones is far too old for her role she's 21 in the book here she's 38 and looks it also her acting wavered between overdone and underdone they took a simple low key love story and blew it all out of proportion the film is fatally long a little over 150 minutes self indulgent and padded to a ridiculous degree it seems producer david o selznick thought he was doing gone with the wind again some of the scenery is truly stunning even on a small tv screen but there's not enough of a story to match the images br br spoiler the ending where jones dies is supposed to be tragic but the bad acting and overblown theatrics had me fighting not to laugh br br to make matters worse actor vittorio de sica overacts to a truly embarrassing degree overblown self indulgent badly cast and slow pretty terrible this was understandably a financial and critical bomb and ended selznick's career as a producer you might want to tune in for some of the scenery at the end but it's really not worth it i give this a 3
<START> and boy is it soft br br i saw this on cable channel bravo one saturday night and here in britain we often have these dire erotic soft core movies turning up late at night on bravo this one follows a weird science type plot of a couple of college geeks building a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies br br when you ve seen one of these movies you ve seen them all with a bunch of bimbos looking like they re advertising silicone implants come on i ve actually seen breasts in real life i m sure some other of us have too and they wobble around unlike here where they defy the laws of if not physics than at least gravity the sex scenes are these tedious affairs where a well buffed geezer rubs himself against his co star without any dialogue or sound apart from some muzak and when they climax it looks like they re both having a bad attack of constipation the girls themselves are very pretty especially brandy davis and nikki fritz but they re wasted in these type of soft core movies br br and if it s fantasy you re after i recommend the lord of the rings trilogy
<START> yeah i know his character was supposed to be a drunk and he may have been just acting goofy but something tells this critic that mr pleasence really was drinking a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the film basically everything he says is slurred and often unintelligible or maybe it was just the poor productions values hard to say br br anyway the race for the yankee is a film that just doesn't work that's a shame too since the film has a terrific opening and a generally interesting plot the production values are just too low and the action just too sparse for this new zealand adventure to deliver the goods the story deals with a us war plane which is filled with gold money and medals which crashes into a lake in new zealand during wwii the plane remains lost for about forty years or so until it somehow washes ashore and a drunk pleasence literally stumbles onto it at first he gathers up all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in town actually getting 75 apiece for them little does he know that once he sells them the local gets on the phone and starts trying to track down info about the plane before you can blink all of the attention brings a wealthy scumbag peppard and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old guy to give up the location of the plane since they know there is much more on it than just medals the old drunk's business partner and his daughter warren then race out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it the resulting action just isn't as fun as you'd hope it would be br br the acting is rather awful save for pleasence george peppard tries to do some kind of i guess austrailian accent but it is hardly convincing lesley ann warren isn't too bad but ken is really bad he's basically doing his best impression of michael pare on his worst day and that's saying something hopefully he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth which looked a bit crooked i don't recall if he'd had them straightened by the time he was in wiseguy the rest of the cast are pretty untalented probably mostly locals who never did much else i guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film and the lack of danger the villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously and honestly there are no helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the dvd cover and none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them either br br the film does have its strengths though the beginning which starts off as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch brian may's score sounds a little too much like the one in mad max 2 but he included a nice little march they play for pleasence in some scenes sounds just like the one in the great escape there are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming the scenery despite the grainy look of the picture is still quite beautiful the thing you'll remember most is the drunken antics of donald pleasence though he was almost enough to save this film almost 4 of 10 stars br br the hound
<START> dennis patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar joe peter boyle a bigot who is getting drunk there at first takes it as a joke but then the story is confirmed on the evening news instead of calling the cops or the like joe decides that since the guy killed a hippie they must be kindred spirits he blackmails the man into becoming his pal at first the film seemed harsh and judgemental but as it revealed itself it actually became quite a complex portrait of the current society yes i think it does exaggerate a bit but in amusing ways that don't really detract from the power of its messages susan sarandon debuted in this film and it's a shock to see how pretty she was around 23 well worth seeing
<START> the movie has a good story line the action is good in some parts but not all of them some of the parts i just felt like the bad guys wouldn't have dosed off yet from my experience from taking martial arts some are the actions are long like always mostly for the boss but for the least important ones they were killed or dosed off with a few hits but some where quite unrealistic or could have done a better job at br br the least important actors or stunt people were the right picks for the movie my girlfriend started to have a crush on them that she started to watch the movie more than she spends her time with me br br the movie is good that is all i can say
<START> caligula shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 fellini satyricon with bizarre sights and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the glory of ancient rome but fellini it ain't first of all it is not as entertaining far too much screen time is devoted to bug eyed rubber faced mcdowell in the titular role his performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing the portrayals by jay robinson in the robe 1953 and david cain in emperor caligula 1983 are far more persuasive and believable with the latter being the most nuanced relief could have been provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully as it is they are little more than cyphers one example is the role of macro played by guido who has tremendous screen presence in an important role but is mostly left in the background the only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some and themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot these two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium however
<START> this film was pure trash not the worse film ever if it were to be broken down the acting was good enough to get the job done but the script was so out there and so stupid that one was left thinking where did my life go even vanessa redgrave whom i love and is the reason i watched this was wasted utterly wasted she didn't even leave an impression the directing was so distant that non of the characters left me much of anything but to see redgrave leave nothing her part was nothing she was good as a mean boss but that was it do depth and she's given depth to small roles see venus and atonement i would not waste my time and was upset to have spent the 5 on this movie i wanted it back no returns skip the film it'll only bring you grief and boredom
<START> my skateboarding career ended in 1974 when my two by four skateboard with steel roller skate wheels hit a rock and i tumbled for days it seemed down the sidewalk outside my parent's house in boston by the time the cast came off my arm summer was gone br br but i have always admired the x games types and surfers especially i think i spent the first month after i moved to southern california on the beaches and piers watching the surfers bemoaning that fact that i had missed my calling it's the sort of thing you should learn young before the horrible senses of self preservation and self awareness burrow in or else at best you'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughed at you'll wind up looking like a trained bear br br i always admired how a good surfer seems to not care about anything but that moment that wave that experience at one with the forces of nature a good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there and the way you interact with it there's a lot of zen in it to me br br this documentary outlines how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding ramps downgrades low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet in their day and time this was all new radical prior to the skate team the idea apparently was to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard hence my long evel knievel at palace like tumble down the front walk br br this film is a look back through time to an america before everything was labeled tagged marketed and jam forced down our throats as extreme seriously what's so extreme about an extreme value meal at taco bell other than the fact that it is an extreme hazard to your colon br br watch this film and watch the birth of before there was an x games before boom boom huck jam before crusty demons before the there were these young street urchins who created without really trying they were just doing it for the purity the pure pleasure of skateboarding in the sun with friends br br i hope they get a cut of the 'extreme' money out there goodness knows they don't get the credit they deserve maybe this film can correct that br br excellent film with a great soundtrack a portrait of a southern california indeed an america that no longer exists br br i don't care for sean penn but he does a decent job narrating
<START> i was really looking forward to seeing this movie having spent a few fantastic college weeks in barcelona myself the premise is right on cue a confused disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused disordered young individuals but the director's weak at symbolism philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark and it leaves us the audience feeling confused disordered bravo br br perhaps if this movie had been presented as a european american pie flick then i'd be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride but right off the bat the director our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the inner self vs the public self one's mother tongue vs one's secondary language furthermore it dives boldly into the subject of racial national stereotyping off to an interesting start eh br br wrong that's as far as it goes these interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue type ending which seemed to be the director's way of floundering to get back on topic it reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere but the speaker ends by saying so in conclusion i hope you see how this relates to my original thought br br furthermore as other reviewers have pointed out the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself if the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes then why did the director introduce a cockney speaking beer swilling english brat as a caricature of prejudice why did the director portray the american as a neanderthal literally banging his chest making ape noises at one point whilst the europeans tolerate him why is the british girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs calling french people frogs and butchering the french language while everyone else is above all that the answer is that this isn't a deep or well thought out film it's simply an retort to the but really it's no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule now there's a funny irony to consider br br ok philosophy artistry socio political commentary aside i was still very bored by this movie there is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls' boyfriends but aside from that i was hardly entertained at all the only reason why i watched it through to the end is that i'd like to brush up on my french spanish you see we americans may be stupid but we do try
