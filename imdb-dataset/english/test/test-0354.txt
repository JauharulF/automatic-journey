<START> this is the first time i feel the need to comment on imdb to write some sort of a review and as it so often happens it's not because of a really excellent film but a truly appalling one br br take the narrating style the youngest might relate to the max payne video game series a cast of virtually which is not a bad thing in itself poor dialogs some dark scenes but not many enough and make a film out of it don't worry about the bad acting the length way too long the lack of immersion the lead character has to be one of the lest interesting i've seen in a long time couldn't care less if he died or the often ridiculous solutions they find to certain problems the lead character finds himself in br br i wouldn't have written anything if it hadn't been for another review here giving it 10 stars i gave it four but maybe three is closer to what i feel about it not only do i not wish to see it again but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself oh and a so called noir film is nothing without a good soundtrack not the case here the ending song sounds like it was more suitable to a western movie br br it's not romance it's not action it's not noir it's not good that would be my review if it weren't for the minimum of 10 lines
<START> this movie was definitely on the boring side the acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice the soundtrack is definitely for fans of kenny g and michael bolton speaking of the soundtrack i found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in it's titles that was a blatant ripoff of paul simon's you can call me al except that they don't acknowledge it at all isn't there something a little hypocritical there the scene that the main kid was in where he was mimicking a game show host was my favorite 10 lines i have to write ten lines about this movie to be included what a ripoff i don't think it's too fair to force people to write more than they would just to get it included
<START> every time i watch this film it just really makes me wanna go out and have a good night my mate uses the weekend has landed speech to psyche himself up before going out and so do i sometimes br br this film is a great debut for the writer director well done mate br br the acting is great all the characters are believable and are larger than life the scenes are a joy to watch running mr floppy flashbacks explanations visualizations are all great the scene in the pub when everyone stands up and starts singing the mock national anthem is a laugh too there's loads of comedy here howard marks' speech is hilarious br br oh god you just need to see this mind you i felt the film did somewhat glorify the use of ecstacy but hey that's the truth of the matter eh at least the film doesn't shy away from this fact i suppose the film does carry a decent message to it as well don't take life too seriously you have to let you hair down sometime and of course the chat in the pub when tries to explain to his mates that he's coming off the drugs is a sure reminder that when the come down's out way the good times you know the party's over br br this is at times a very clever film in it's use of the camera lighting etc it was a realised piece of cinema and a great feel good tale of mates love clubs and drugs br br get outta the people br br 8 10 br br enjoy
<START> my boss at the time and showed it to us at a halloween party at our office he is the chris huntley that co wrote and acted in it he knows it's bad we know it's bad and we all agree that the monster looks way too much like a vagina to be coincidence maybe it was from a experiment gone wrong br br it was a very low budget and the actors were all friends so what you have here is a case of hey gang put on a show br br nobody got hurt and it was a first attempt nothing wrong with that it gave us all a good laugh and it's a great film to watch with friends and make fun of
<START> this is a great example of what happened at comedy central after dave chapelle left here's the problem with carlos mencia firstly his birth name is ned and was known that until he was 18 when he switched his name to ned mencia he was born in honduras though he acts like he's from mexico he grew up in the united states as well br br i might be able to forgive all that crap but br br he's been caught stealing other peoples material joe has been his most vocal critic in this way the stereotype olympics was an idea he ripped off a couple of dj's from miami he has stolen jokes from bill cosby he stole george lopez's material in his own hbo special 13 minutes of it br br he thinks what he's doing is so original but dave chapelle and lisa have been cracking on race for years before this idiot amoung others br br this show will crash and burn the word can't last that long before it gets old he hasn't done anything new since the first episode br br wanna hear a joke a jumping a fence that's funny for 3 seasons not br br awful
<START> beowulf is like a very bad game no characters no story no real dialogues bad fights it's probably the worst movie in the history of cinema it's deadly boring a lost of time i'm really sorry for christophe lambert who visibly doesn't know how to choose a role if someone suggests you to see beowulf believe me run like mad
<START> son of the mask is a terrible excuse of a movie i went to see this with my friend and i still wish we had seen because of dixie instead i must say that it is partially my fault as i agreed to go see it with him being a fan of the first mask movie jim carrey was hilarious i had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was br br ten minutes into the movie i knew it was headed for disaster disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children shrieking with laughter but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbelief br br finding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as i did is surprising to even me as i loved scary movie and anchorman two films which many people i know found crude and offensive but the thing is son of the mask is not funny unless you're under the age of ten br br the film features lots of cgi in it but it cannot save this piece of rubbish whoever allowed this movie to make it to the big screen was probably thinking it had potential considering the success of its original unfortunately it has none of the laughs fun or excitement of the first creating a mockery of the original movie i recommend renting the original mask to anyone who is thinking about seeing this one 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess
<START> may contain spoilers br br i was super excited to go see blood and chocolate with my friends i couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites but as soon as the movie started i couldn't believe how different it was at first i was like okay so both of her parents are dead maybe it'll be okay but then came the rest of the movie by the time it was over i was furious nothing was correct but their names and the fact that vivian fell in love with aiden by the end of the book gabriel was my all time favorite and then the movie goes and turns him into a complete heartless idiot the movie also showed the or werewolves as these vile evil creatures were as the book shows them as just wanting to fit in and keep their pack safe they would never kill humans for the fun of it br br if they wanted to make a movie like they did they should have given it a different title and named the characters different because then i would go out and watch it again and buy it but when i think about it all i can see is the bad you couldn't pay me to go see it again or buy it
<START> this is a revised riverdance presentation staged at radio city music hall in new york city of the three irish dance musicals that i watched during the mid to late '90s which includes the first riverdance and lord of the dance i liked this one the best br br i thought it was better than the original held in dublin ireland because it adds segments that are mostly good it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with this is just a very solid show with few weak spots to be certain there are some songs dances that are just fair but none that are poor which is amazing considering there are 20 numbers in all br br the cast is similar to the first riverdance with the main exception of colin dunne replacing michael flatley as the featured dancer both are extremely talented the major difference might be in their looks with dunne a little black haired guy while flatley is the clean shaven blond i prefer dunne because ego is so big he gets annoying at times the female lead jean butler thankfully is still there and is great to watch what graceful beauty and talent butler and the rest of these women have the greatest legs i've seen on dancers i also enjoyed the dancing of maria pages a spanish flamenco performer and two guys daniel b and ivan thomas one number with those two pairing off against dunne and two other dancers 0 is called trading taps and is terrific fun to watch maybe the highlight of the whole show i have no complaints about violinist eileen either br br the fast irish songs here appealed to me the most i appreciated the audience not getting in the way of the performance either with shrieks and screams like the women do in the lord of the dance video
<START> this version of the gulliver stories is definitely bizarre the production adds a frame story that's what it's becoming famous for of gulliver returning to his wife and son in one incredibly overlong and sometimes fails to hold attention throughout but the odd images and diverse cast will keep you looking mary steenburgen does the best job of the cast danson seems a bit out of place with his american accent the whole asylum thing is awfully disturbing often but is nonetheless interesting and holds the journeys of gulliver together well character really does seem insane however he should have worked on being a little more believeable to everyone in my opinion also confusing is going from present to past anyone else think the yahoos are the ugliest things ever to grace a television screen or in line for it confusing sometimes boring but still highlighted by some good acting overall wonderful visual effects and a few enjoyable parts nbc's first of many event films from robert sr see it for yourself to decide how it goes for you however i give it 1 2 out of 5 stars
<START> though several scenes of can be described as over the top i thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of near taboo twisted comedy br br is a great film with great dialog i wouldn't say that this film is for everyone but the film is on my top 10 list br br if you can look beyond it's occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is i would hope you could see it in the same light that i do
<START> this thing works on all levels it's intense as a thriller full of lars von trier homages but also very much its own film and it does have a message happiness comes from within best personified in the wounded soldier who practically and believe it or not humorously disintegrates limb by limb throughout the film all the while apologizing to others for imposing on them you laugh at him but you envy him as well the central character is a well meaning but clumsy writer who spends the whole film trying to help those he befriends on a train from stockholm to berlin just after world war ii he ties the parallel stories together and really screws people up in the process to say things go wrong is an understatement and structurally the characters are all in perfect opposition to each other it's like every one of them has an opposite just so tight like watching anti matter collide you will not believe the sick stuff you end up laughing at to say more would qualify as a spoiler all i can say is it is a shame this film has not been released in the us not even on dvd some moron probably told them americans wouldn't get it which is crap because we not only get but produce things like south park if this film gets marketed in the us it should be sold as a mainstream black comedy because that's what it is over the top sick and twisted but
<START> i guess it wasn't entirely the filmmaker's fault though the film suffered from the unimaginably stupid decision to tell clayton moore who had done the role in the 1950's and was the lone ranger us old folks grew up with he couldn't wear the mask in public now mind you the poor guy wasn't making all that much money doing so and it wasn't like he was going to take anything away from this film but the whole thing seemed gratuitous br br the other thing the film suffered from besides a leading man whose voice was so awful they had to overdub it was that fact that westerns weren't so hip in 1981 john wayne was dead and we had just been subjected to a decade long major liberal guilt trip about how the west was built on genocide of the native americans that and blazing saddles sent up the whole genre the campfire scene enough said hollywood shied away from westerns because science fiction was cool then br br the one scene that underscored it was when after rescuing the drunken president grant and seriously i'd have let grant stay with the bad guys the country would have been better off grant asks tonto what his reward should be honor your treaties with my people yeah right like that was going to happen
<START> this is jonas debut as a director and to be honest it shows it looks like he threw in every type of camera trick that he learned in film school to try and add some style to a badly written script which he helped write film has lance henriksen and a group of others searching the pacific northwest for a plane that crashed that his daughter was on and also a special machine his company has built that he wants to also retrieve the first 5 minutes of the film is either blurry or shaky or out of focus tries to capture the blair witch mode with these type of shots and they grow tiresome very quickly and there is also the pov shots that are right from wolfen and predator these shots are from the point of view pov of the sasquatch the editing is very choppy at times as a scene seems to shift right in the middle i have heard this film was shot in about 12 days and i suppose instead of starting back to one they just restarted without stopping and edited the scene together and the rest of the film is fade outs from one scene to another they're are so many scenes that fade out that i lost count now the nude scene with andrea roth its not her you can easily see its a body double and you know your watching a bad b movie when in the middle of the pacific northwest a hot chick decides to go to the nearest hot spring and bathe spoiler alert br br and the sasquatch himself is not bad when you don't really see him and he's just a blurry image behind some trees or bushes but when you finally see him at the end your of course disappointed first of all he's not that tall the actor who is playing sasquatch is only hairy in certain spots on his body its a partial suit and he's bald i have heard that a make up person died during filming and maybe that explains why the costume looks hastily made some of the sound effects that are coming from the sasquatch are nothing more than the familiar lion roars that we have all heard in other films i do have to admit that henriksen is not to bad yes he's working with bad material but he has one of those interesting faces that can actually enhance certain moments of the film people keep saying that a good bigfoot film has never been made but i disagree i have always said that the creature from black lake is a good film and i highly recommend that one i'm a sucker for a sasquatch film but this one is just to amateurish
<START> having obtained a copy of cup i must confess it is not as funny as i originally thought it is better charlie williams eat your heart out match fixing never pitch at 45 ronnie and reggie kay george best the coach driver who thinks is in south wales it's all this and that bertie tim lucky cup hat not that he's into gimmicks sugar plum fairy confused watch it again the innovative use of real footage with players was brilliant and the producer should be proud of giving us a masterpiece come on itv do the viewers and yourself a favour show it again please
