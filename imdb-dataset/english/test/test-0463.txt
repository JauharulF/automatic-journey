<START> well since it's called porno holocaust and directed by joe d'amato i went into this film expecting sleaze and while i somewhat got it porno holocaust was a massive disappointment as it's just so damned boring the title suggests that the film will feature porn and that's not wrong porno holocaust is pretty much just porn and most of it is just the same stuff over and over again i was fast forwarding before the end the first sex scene is between two women and it got my hopes up but after that it just degenerates into normal porn and the rest of the film for the first hour is made up of talking and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through the plot focuses on a deserted island where believe it or not something strange is going on naturally it's not long before a group of people made up of a few men and some scientists who all happen to be sexy women land on the island they have sex a few times and some strange things happen then over an hour later they're attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladies br br this must have seemed like a good idea for an original porno a zombie who likes to get it on but unsurprisingly it doesn't work well at all the film clocks in at just ten minutes short of the two hour mark and that is far too long for a film like this i have no idea why porno holocaust is as long as it is if they'd just snipped one minute out of every sex scene the film would have been under ninety minutes and that would have made it much more tolerable the zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear it's quite a long time before there's a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place and when it does finally appear it's a huge disappointment i realise that this is low budget b movie trash but d'amato surely could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this i'm not even going to bother mentioning the acting atmosphere etc there's no point porno holocaust is basically just your average dull porn flick with a slight sprinkling of horror and i can't recommend it
<START> this episode has just aired in the uk br br what a disappointment the heavy handed touches of humour were ill judged childish and detracted from what could have been a pretty good storyline i cannot believe that jerry bruckheimer allowed this episode to take place i have seen every previous episode of this show and even the episode where jack played his own older self was way ahead of this episode the lesbian kiss was pathetic sensationalism br br there was also no continuity from the previous episode there was nothing in the storyline investigating martin's dangerous behaviour or possible drug addiction there was similarly nothing explicitly written about jack's burgeoning relationship with ann usually without a trace is pretty good at this sort of continuity br br the next episode needs to be a considerable improvement
<START> critics are a strange kind of people some of them are common people like you and me some of them are not when a critic say cruelty is beautiful i wonder where they did grow up what's beautiful with filming a field some clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can't do it with style and capture the mood of the environments for sure can't i've seen kids do better footage than manage to do in cruelty but that's not the worst part the worst part is the whole recording i refuse to call this a film is just a bad excuse to picture nudity and extreme torture rapes of both sexes masturbation sperm pissing cannibalism child murder and much much more i love gore splatter and i love horror this ain't neither of those this is utter crap and if my comments make just one single person skip cruelty it's been worth it always remember that your life won't last forever don't waste two hours of precious time on cruelty you've been warned
<START> this television show is stereotypical and far fetched in many of its aspects br br first of all the setting all of the characters attend this unbelievable boarding school with painted stylish dorms the campus seems to have no reasonable rules for instance the boys are often seen in the girls' dormitories and vice versa but this may be simply because the dorm adviser a silly character that basically bores the viewer instead of amusing them as i assume her purpose is supposed to be sits around and does nothing i have friends in boarding schools and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show br br next the characters i was so disappointed to discover that nickelodeon wasn't creative at all with the personalities in this show they all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does looks grades sports guys judgment creativity etc michael is the jock logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing aside from aggravate all the characters as well as us poor viewers nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straight a's dana was the tough girl quinn is the unrealistic 'smart kid ' whom they consistently make fun of chase is the guy who is afraid of confessing his 'true which really aggravates me as the show continues and that new girl lola or something is just another clone of nicole br br the main two characters that aggravate me the most are zoey and quinn first of all i just do not understand character she was obviously created to be the 'perfect' character as i said above but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them in most of the episodes she creates a problem then has to fix it what's frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they haven't even created a very realistic character to begin with br br quinn on the other hand bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting the impression i get from nick concerning her character is that 'geeks' and are people to laugh at to criticize to mock in the spring break episode they did a year ago they introduced two more who the characters had to make 'cool ' i found this highly offensive and stereotypical what kind of message is nick sending to these kids is it don't do well in school don't get good grades don't study hard you'll end up being a geek and we will mock your profession in future television series because that is definitely the message i get from these poorly constructed characters and it is an awful message through and through br br all i can do is hope that nick one day realizes that by putting down the intelligent folks in our world they are not doing anyone any good
<START> another french film with absurdity baise moi f ck me tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f ck one of them is a porn star who escapes from her community after being raped and killing her boyfriend second one is a hooker who kills her flatmate and sees her boyfriend being shot dead after those incidents they meet at a tube station both misses the last train then the whole thing starts they find a bound and come very close they abuse men sexually take drugs drive around the country and have lots of sex thats all about baise moi really we can see that they have no mercy for their victims they even kill a woman for her money both actresses are real porn stars in france that affects the movie in two different ways they look so comfortable in sex scenes nonetheless they can't make the whole film worth watching as to me the film does not require no further ability of acting than that it is a version of thelma and louise on a different level i could recommend you loads of things to do instead of watching baise moi so bother to watch if you wanna see a pointless kinky film out of
<START> i lived in london most of my adult life before i moved stateside so missed this film when it came out and only saw this now on hbo i disagree with anyone who thinks this should have been a hollywood production the uk team gave it a chilling and foreboding atmosphere from day one and i was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes wondering what was going to happen to my home city and of course nine months after the film comes out 7 7 happens yes the truth is stranger than fiction having lived in both countries it is also clear the likelihood of this happening in the uk is much greater than in the us muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the uk in the us they assimilate much more readily
<START> this pointless film was a complete disappointment none of the characters is likeable in the least so you watch what befalls each without really caring what was worst was renting this movie at a gay owned establishment only to find that this story of male hustlers was filled with homophobic young men engaged in plenty of scenes of straight sex and not one single scene of gay sex
<START> delivers great acting and greater special effects stars david cronenberg one of my personal favorites as decker it's special effects on the monsters were so good you thought they might be really deformed clive barker however demented scored a perfect 10 on my list
<START> terrible writing highly contrived from a do gooder who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in l a or the usa in the present day the gushing positive reviews are a mystery to me but could only be provided by folks who think that someone's good intentions should be applauded regardless of how shallow simpleminded and just totally unrealistic the results are if you want to see a film which deals realistically with modern day l a race issues the movie you need to see and probably already saw is pulp fiction there's more honesty and realism regarding race in any two minutes of that film than there are in the full 4 hours oh i'm sorry it just felt like 4 hours of this stinker br br if anyone ever needs proof that the path to hell is paved with good intentions then this is the movie for you
<START> weak direction weak plot unimpressive music i wonder why is there in the movie world in the first place she tried to reveal a lot of her talent mostly skin but failed to impress br br music wasn't that impressive as well only one song was worth listening to br br the title well they tried to justify the title of the movie in the end but it didn't make sense br br there were many unwanted twists and turns in the story which made it more boring however if someone's a dino fan please go ahead and watch it
<START> being both a dario argento fan and a phantom of the opera fan i was dying to see his first take on the story before the so bad it's good dario argento's phantom of the opera the film is just terrific even the plot which here is one of argento's best at a coherent story the way he turns a classic romance story into a creepy slasher is just terrific the film has a very nightmarish feel which helps on keeping you on the edge of your seat the colors have never been better in an argento film since the jaw dropping suspiria the murders are clever and gory all done in argento's trademark style the thing with the eyes in this film is just unsettling and done some much better than in fulci's splatter the acting is so so but once you seen the movie more times you understand the characters' motivations better and you get used to it my two biggest complains about it is the use of rock music i think it was a clever idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy metal but it's not executed very well here the ending is very disappointing which is the worst thing about the movie seeming to echo argento's previous phenomena but done terribly it just didn't need to end that way the same thing happened in the director's cut of the exorcist i wished they kept the original ending but still it's a fantastic motion picture and really a must see if only for daria memorable murder sequence
<START> the first time i watched this movie i was ten years old i thought it was bad then and at that age i had no cinematic taste whatsoever i watched this movie on cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why i hated the movie in the first place madonna's character nikki is annoying and obnoxious there's no way that the main character would ever fall in love with her the jokes were corny and the dialogue was worse than a t v soap opera i'm glad that i didn't see this movie at the theatre or rent it i feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me madonna is not necessarily a bad actress but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot
<START> chris noth plays a maniac who wrote a children's book as a young lad posing as a doctor who menaces a community in order to push his sister's son into the position as his school's genius the only man that can stop him is a cop who plays by his own rules and is forced to go undercover with the help of his mute father who communicates via board will rick springfield find out whats up or will somebody sabotage his recording studio does the mentally retarded boy who operates the book mobile have clues watch to find out i'm not making this up
<START> a low rent cheaply made police thriller that's kept bearable by some fair humorous bits the nice chemistry between the two leads and especially by james remar's satisfying turn as a narcissistic psychopathic and naturally indestructible villain obviously a low quality picture both visually and dramatically with a rather resigned burt but not unwatchable
<START> it's a movie with a theatrical message blended with some clever moments films like these are the stretching grounds of great actors they enjoy tossing the ball in open pieces like these the angel that wasn't what we see in old books and churches is quite a nice change it is echoed in kevin smith's piece dogma almost in the same slapstick vein br br 0 watch this film for a good day after you suck it all in could it be that so many films are trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of films like this possibly one of the most fun pieces i have seen in a while i ran into this one on vhs in a trash can because someone's basement was flooded this summer and i grabbed a handful of tapes br br whether in a trash bin or on the silver screen mild comedies like this are fun you just don't have to tell everyone at a hip nightclub that you like it or a swank political party just keep it for yourself and i'll bet plenty of people will borrow it from time to time
