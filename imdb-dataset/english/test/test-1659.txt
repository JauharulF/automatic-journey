<START> i first caught up with jennifer years ago while out of town when it showed up on tv in the middle of the night i fell asleep before it ended but it stuck with me until i had to track it down its appeal is that though there's not a lot to it it weaves an intriguing atmosphere and because ida lupino and howard duff real life man and wife at the time display an alluring low key chemistry lupino plays a woman engaged to house sit a vast california estate whose previous caretaker jennifer up and disappeared shades of jack nicholson in the shining although in this instance it's not lupino who goes or went mad duff is the guy in town who manages the estate's finances and takes a shine to lupino who decides to play hard to get she becomes more and more involved not to say obsessed with what happened to her predecessor in the old dark house full of descending and locked the atmospherics and the romantic byplay are by far the best part of the movie as viewers are likely to find the resolution a bit of a letdown there's just not that much to it except a little frisson at the tail end that anticipates brian de palma's filmic but it's well done and again it sticks with you extra added attraction this is the film that introduced the song angel eyes which would become part of the standard repertoire of ol' blue eyes
<START> having been brought up in city as a child i recognize many of the local people in the movie so for me it's like a trip down memory lane to see the city story again as a matter of fact my is in it in one of the very first scenes uncle drew's the one in the hawaiian shirt who his chair out to get a better look at the singer stripper br br unless you've been there like mr page and i both have you couldn't possibly understand the story it tells the reviewer from new york calls john patterson racist most likely without ever having had an encounter with mr patterson or his father and what is your point in bringing up mr employment now it has nothing to do with the film that you're supposedly reviewing how in the world can you sit back and judge either them or this film when you've probably gone no further yourself than the south bronx it's been my experience that people who do that are simply attempting to feel morally superior to the folks portrayed in the movie by most accounts of the time both mr were basically good and decent men their families were respectable people as were most of the people who lived in city br br by the way why is so hard for those who live outside of the south to believe that there are good and decent people even in small towns in alabama and why do they assume that everyone living in a small southern town is a racist my parents lived there and yet they didn't tolerate it in our household others didn't tolerate it either but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives on through the willful ignorance of others br br the movie itself is simple and direct it isn't the whole story hollywood added a certain sensationalism when the film was made parts of it were absolutely on target other parts of it bordered on fairy tales and if it's the source that anyone uses to decide how folks in small southern towns are they need to get a grip and understand what most of us do it's only a movie
<START> this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about times lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing i have to admit that the whole audience i was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were greek or italian so i guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes god and i can never get that 90 minutes back
<START> this outstanding film has about the best acting that you'll ever see and that alone makes this a must see the entire cast is excellent but then again it had to be in order to keep up with dustin hoffman and meryl streep it didn't take me long to get hooked on this film and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good this is top notch entertainment this is a rare film that actually deserved all the oscar recognition that it received see it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed
<START> perhaps the weakest film in the kharis series despite the presence of john carradine miscast as an egyptian high priest and george zucco as his predecessor hilariously afflicted by a bad case of disease supporting lon chaney jr as the titular creature if indeed it was him under the bandages as his contribution is negligible at best it's a watchable 60 minutes in itself i guess but the standards have considerably lowered when compared even to the two previous entries and the end result is strictly routine and not at all memorable just about the only interesting feature here is the fact that the female lead happens to be the reincarnation of princess ananka mentioned a great deal in earlier films but never actually seen
<START> i can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent tv series otherwise there are just too many of these murder plot themes i don't like the theme of the two over clever selfish youths killing as an intellectual exercise i've no interest whatsoever in hitchcock who appears to have been associated with this in some way i don't intend to find out about but don't misunderstand me the theme is in itself excellent the whole movie is so well done and of course sandra bullock is superlative as always br br sandra's character is as in miss congeniality not rated by the male team she works with in spite of her obvious skills and the boss mostly ignores her ideas eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to her male partner of course sandra works out what's going on and nearly gets killed in a very dramatic denouement it's intriguing how the boy who worked out the murder plot can't allow her to be killed by his colleague he has a conscience of some sort and perhaps could be saved while the other is a true psychopath br br sandra's hard shell is caused by misery in her past that's tied in poignantly with the murder case her colleague realising that sandra's solving this case in spite of being balked by the dense superior finally discovers what happened to sandra herself in her teens that she must now face up to and exorcise and the last scene shows her starting we hope anyway to do just that br br i can see from the few other reviews i've had time to read that this movie would attract a group those interested in the two spoilt boys away their time with their grisly philosophical determination to trick the police and get away with the perfect murder the relationship between them that's so cleverly depicted the ghastly links to the heroine's past a police theme and some smokes and mirrors as well as for hitchcock fans br br for those who've why bullock's character has to have a problematic past really i think this would be a far less interesting movie if she had been just a detective trying to fathom what was going on with a willing sidekick helping out and a male chauvinist boss the link between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective becoming too involved or otherwise how would she lose her arrogant boss's confidence and thereby nearly lose her life that's hardly an original theme in fact it's usually an extremely irritating theme as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired operative to get off the case and leave it to someone who clearly doesn't have quite the skills to solve it nice though the sidekick is i was getting very worried towards the end re what might happen to sandra's character as her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime dangerously drove her on with this case by herself br br i wasn't disappointed re the relationship between bullock's character and her sidekick that goes along interestingly and at times very poignantly br br the relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing if that's what you were interested in watching i felt it was kept low key in some ways either because the movie makers didn't want to get into boy boy friendships too much or because we weren't supposed to think emotion ruled their relationship the movie cleverly makes you wonder which boy's in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at various stages br br there one thing i wish had been clarified and that's what happens after the movie ends when sandra's character arrives at the court you need to see to movie to know why she's there br br very well acted by all i certainly can't agree with those who complained against bullock's acting she was superb the part suited her very well indeed the story is gripping even if murder mysteries aren't your thing and they aren't that often mine
<START> i blame birth of a nation myself for commencing the long running tradition of hollywood of history of which there can be few greater examples than this apart from getting the names of custer and his 7th cavalry crazy horse and the sioux and president grant spelt right the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition try custer and his wife's learning of the phony gold rush to excuse the invasion of the sioux territory custer's testimony in front of congress pleading the rights of the red indians and to top it all custer's storming into the president's office to beg to return to his post honestly there's plenty more of the same some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness and yet and yet it's still a great actioner with flynn as dashing as ever dehavilland as beguiling as ever the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences ford taught us in liberty valance to believe the legend before the truth here i think we're closer to the legend of the legend but hey it's only a movie and a rollicking wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that
<START> william h macy is terrific in this alfred hitchcock esque film macy stars as a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends the characters that ensue are hilarious james cromwell gives a terrific performance as a blackmailing private detective as always macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal performance see this movie whenever it is on t v and check your video stores because this is one you don't want to miss
<START> interesting cartoon included on the dvd of the lost skeleton of cadavra i especially like the way the color was used in the background art very artistic for columbia whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget and the results looked like it br br i do wonder however how a certain um finger gesture ever got past the censors granted the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today you'd think someone besides the animators would have noticed though especially since it's seen three times in the scene in question and based on the context i suspect that its inclusion was intentional something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors would notice
<START> after hearing that some of the people behind the low budget flicks terror in rock'n'roll and it came from outer space and stuff were involved in making this movie i decided to buy it unseen on dvd i wish i hadn't the other movies were funny tongue in cheek and kinda stupid while is devoid of any humor at all and it is so god awful that i'm getting angry just thinking about it the worst actors possible the worst script possible the worst special effects available and the most unsexy sex scene ever uhhh and the whole thing goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes please do not ever make another movie
<START> just before dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it this movie has great suspense great acting very well done camera work nice job mr which makes a extremely well made slasher though low on gore for the 80s it still has the effect on you after it is over the opening kill machete through the crotch looked so real and the fist to the mouth death left me stunned overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars if you are looking for a gore fest don't look here but if you want chills sent down your back see this one there are 6 deaths and one of them you don't see but it leaves you mind to think how was she killed the stranded theme reminded me of 1977's the hills have eyes which followed kind of the same concept but in the desert with but still slasher fans give this forgotten gem i promise you you will be
<START> a low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore however it is not an excuse for poor writing it is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical the dialog in this movie was on par with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training br br i also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it with that being said no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself that was perfect i see better character acting on canadian television br br this movie had a paper thin plot bad acting poor dialog and holds no intelligent ideas at all this simply proves to me that some independent films are that way for a reason if your looking for a quick scare rent anything else even the cable guy was a scarier film after watching this film i think i would have been better off watching a re run on the x files
<START> i didn't particularly like sliding doors or twice upon a yesterday so i certainly didn't this poor second rate excuse for those films an idea that's been done to death what would happen if and the script is shoddy and unsuccessful not to mention the obvious attempt at adding sex nudity simply to gain an r rating and certain scenes that just weren't necessary but were there to push the boundaries i really don't need to see a kid urinating or a struggle with a especially when they have absolutely no connection to or use in the film br br the acting was also very poor the only actor i found the least bit satisfying was her daughter the rest were two dimensional and quite unbelievable the people i watched this with left the room about halfway through i managed to finish it but not without fast forwarding through part of it br br overall nothing new here it's a generic and boring film the few rather amusing moments are far outweighed by the silly or stupid ones this would be dull even if it hadn't been done before if it weren't such a rehash i'd rate it a five but even for an indie film this was severely lacking and as a rehash it loses on originality as well 3 10
<START> sex is a most noteworthy aspect of existence it is perhaps the most interesting activity there is between birth and death le de americain studies human sexuality in a dry and boring manner actually worse than being simply boring seeing nude 40 year olds is well unpleasant br br i guess there is some shock value in having adults as old as our parents talk about sex but after twenty minutes this stops being interesting perhaps if the characters were all 20 years younger the film would be more visually captivating br br le de americain is not worth the time
<START> i used to watch this too at junior school in hampshire around 1975 the odd thing is that from time to time i still think about it i am now 40 the big question running through out the length of the series no idea how many episodes 6 was the identity of the person riding the motorcycle 'i've ask friends in the past about this series and they have no idea what i'm talking about and think its some kind of weird dream i've had i've never understood to this day the educational benefit of this but thought at the time it was great but slightly scary i seem to remember that there used to be a break of some sort in the middle of each episode no idea why would love to see it again got hold of a short clip via the bbc cult website
