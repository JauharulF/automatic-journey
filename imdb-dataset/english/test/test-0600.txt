<START> i was struck by the awful acting and script for this movie all the characters seem rendered immobile by personal issues rather like deer in headlights they dither around whining and moaning about their emotions when decisive actions need to be taken i found myself yelling at the tv screen trying to wake them up to their situation and do something the plot line is implausible every time there is a key decision to be taken by a lead character one of the other characters has to bring up all the problems with the obvious decision as though to further render the decision more difficult it is a tried melodramatic ploy and just wants to make you groan clearly the import of the decision is obvious you don't need to treat the audience as idiots overall there is just too much emotional melodrama in the whole movie
<START> i was reading in a stuff magazine about some of the goriest bloodiest films that asia had to offer and i immediately jumped to netflix to quench my thirst boy what a mistake i made this movie is one of the worst films i have seen first and foremost no plot what i expected to be the plot see revenge turned into a series of events just happening in a effort to spend their special effects budget of 14 89 and waste studio time they should have kept their money and not wasted their time nor yours br br when a major plot twist occurs tetsuo ii body hammer is given a new identity and i wasn't buying it a flashback is given that should answer our questions but seemed to me like i turned on showtime at 3 47 am and dropped acid the movie continues and spirals out of control with cheesy graphics and special olympic effects br br do i seem bitter about this film yes did i see iron man no was there a plot no was it so symbolic that i didn't understand no was there a body hammer beats the hell out of me so take my advice and stay away br br i must admit though i have had so much fun writing this and laughing to myself about this film that if you want to laugh watch it
<START> at the beginning of the movie ramgopal verma says that sarkar is his tribute to the godfather this one feels more like an insult it pales terribly in comparison to the coppola classic although no one was expecting ramgopal verma to fill coppola's shoes the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz br br amitabh bachchan plays sarkar a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to indian political party supremo bal thackeray abhishek bachchan plays his son shankar who returns from abroad and gets caught up in politics at home just like al pacino in the original godfather br br as most bollywood fare incidents and characters are overtly simplistic and devoid of any kind of solid foundation quick phone calls and sudden announcements turn the film from one direction to another takes to mumbai's murky underworld politics crime nexus like a duck takes to water amithab bachchan as sarkar is supposed to look magnificent and powerful he just ends up looking old and clueless most of his acting is centered around constantly staring at different things around the movie set the actor in front of him the floor or in some other random direction br br however kay kay performs exceedingly well as the wronged elder son so does as rashid the dubai based dope smuggler who wants to gets his footing in mumbai this actor has awesome screen presence and can send chills down your spine with just the way he looks the moment he enters the screen you want to run and hide under the bed br br all its obvious flaws not withstanding the film did well at the box office the buzz and the big star cast obviously helping also verma manages to hold your interest albeit mildly towards the later half of the film he is actually making a sequel to this one which i am sure will be more of the same fare
<START> i remember watching this series avidly every saturday evening it was the highlight of the week i loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by i still have their legend album i loved the way they solved the problem of michael leaving by creating another robin this time the earl of huntingdon i believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times another thing i loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors i'm sure robin and his men would have young after all people didn't live that long in those days other robins always look too old kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robin's granddad the only sad thing was the ending it's a shame they couldn't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending
<START> i have just watched the season 2 finale of doctor who and apart from a couple of dull episodes this show is fantastic br br its a sad loss that we say goodbye to a main character once again in the season final but the show moves on br br the bbc does need to increase the budget on the show there are only so many things that can happen in london and the surrounding areas also some of the special effects all though on the main very good on the odd occasion do need to be a little more polished br br it was a huge gamble for the bbc to bring back a show that lost its way a long time ago and they must be congratulated for doing so br br roll on to the christmas 2006 special the 2005 christmas special was by far the best thing on television
<START> the movie everything is illuminated comes from first time writer director liev schreiber adapting jonathan safran first novel the book was ambitious and sprawling its magical realist elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen the movie wisely attempts less while the end result is not as wildly original as the novel it's still an accomplished movie about a strange eastern european road trip or as one of the characters would have it a very rigid search br br that character is alex eugene a young ukrainian man who loves american pop culture but can't seem to get the english language straight nevertheless his grandfather russian actor boris who runs a tour company catering to american jews convinces him to serve as a translator for jonathan elijah wood jonathan is investigating his family history and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis more than one family secret gets revealed during their quest br br the movie's jonathan not to be confused with the author of the novel is a semi weirdo who steals his own grandmother's dentures to add to his collection of family things wood's quiet wide eyed earnest manner works very well in this role makes an impressive debut as the loose limbed easygoing alex his malapropisms are hilarious but he is also able to pull off the character's growing self awareness the dog is very funny as the demented sammy davis jr jr and one of the few movie dogs i've ever seen that isn't cloyingly cute and precocious br br everything is illuminated eventually puts the holocaust on a human scale asking us to remember it not as a general event but as millions of specific small tragedies reminiscent of a european movie it also ponders the effect of past events on present day young people like jonathan and alex with its original perspective strong performances and some very striking visuals everything is illuminated is great work for a first timer and hopefully schreiber will continue to direct movies
<START> first i like s segal but in this movie he has hit rock bottom and started to dig br br the plot what plot very strange and plot br br the actions way below segals standards br br the good parts mr segal is a pro and shows it that's it br br summary i could write and have done so a better script for mr segal in case you read this stephen mail me i'll give you a better script to do a better movie the only realistic part is the one where see spoiler part br br spoiler part stop reading here if you plan to see the movie gas leak wow a 'black box' recorder in a hotel room i work in the industry laughable the bad guy away' that much is true in life
<START> this thing takes the horny teenager genre very poorly respected to begin with and completely flushes it down the toilet the only people i would even consider recommending it to are teenage girls for a revealing scene in a boys' locker room and in the end i wouldn't make such a recommendation to do so would be to contribute to the delinquency of a juvenile an absolute piece of garbage with utterly no redeeming qualities
<START> dr paul richard gere a successful surgeon has his wife leave him his son an uncredited james franco not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on adrienne willis diane lane has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her they both need to get away she watches over a beautiful inn in at the same time he books a room they're all alone together you can pretty much figure out the rest br br this is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film it's beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes there's tragedy romance more tragedy and an uplifting ending sort of the great acting by gere and lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn't really about much every single bit of the plot is predictable i rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events also it's far too short i didn't believe the romance between gere and lane for a second if comes out of nowhere and moves very quickly still the movie does work the inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and i was in tears by the end along with most of the audience so it's a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting it doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting i give it a 7
<START> this is a movie with a wonderful concept but very weak writing it should never have been released with out at least three more re writes assuming it got any the story is too loosly held together and there are too many 90 degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie it would be great to see what a decent screen writer could do with the story
<START> ernest p comes through with his third movie presentation jim varney not only plays ernest but doubles as the evil mr nash from start to finish this movie has some solid laughs and makes a good family film rated pg for comic book violence
<START> i've just seen this movie in a preview and i can only recommend to watch it it was about 90 minutes long and when it was over i felt like it could go on for hours the stories of the protagonists are so realistic and you feel really at home the movie basically consists of dialogs but i wasn't bored a minute 18 people of really different characters and each one of them acted out so well i had to laugh felt awkward was sad and still felt happiness all in all it is a movie that shows the different kinds of people in our society the way they communicate and how love has changed and nowadays is handled as an economic thing dating becomes something that is similar to an audition the whole audience loved it so please watch it if there's a possibility you'll love it
<START> for an independent film it scores well with reasonably high production values and a great cast the acting is uneven but the plot is compelling we could have used a bit more development of wes ramsey's character but hey the guy's fun to look at nonetheless mary kay place and jacqueline bisset are like icing on the cake br br it's not surprising that it was controversial on its release it presents a less than flattering portrayal of the morman church and its relationship with gays while like brokeback mountain it's about tolerance and accepting one's own life i found it to be more successful in conveying a positive message it was more moving too
<START> the cinemascope color cinematography of leon shamroy is quite remarkable here including his use of colored filters for br br various scenes the alfred score has to be the most sensual and seductive score hollywood ever produced it's a shame it is no longer available on cd the actors however never rise to the occasion the accents are so varied from the subdued british of ustinov and purdom to the hollywood of baxter and mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision tommy rettig is jarringly american acting styles span the range from zombie like to stilted only ustinov as a conniving one eyed servant steals the show what there is of it to steal the premise the story of a young egyptian doctor seduced and abandoned by the rich and the parallel theme of the cult of the single god ra persecuted by the authorities has its interesting points but when the film's plot fades it is the haunting music and visuals that remain
<START> i have heard an awful lot about 'the english patient' and i finally decided to get the cd and find out what all the ballyhoo was about what i found out was a cinematic delight and should i repeat always be watched with an open mind if you are a religious moral zealot i am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates as i remember correctly before i watched this film i read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who i quote said 'that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they when it comes to morality i agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence br br i must admit rarely have i seen such a wonderfully crafted film i keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious first and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an extramarital affair beware but lets not keep focusing on that instead let's focus on how the story was told it's an of flashbacks and the present its set in the world war ii and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash count played wonderfully by ralph fiennes who is looked after by an army nurse juliet binoche in war torn italy just before the beginning of the end defeat of the axis powers the burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an english woman katherine kristin scott thomas shown in flashbacks set in pre war africa the past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer the locales in the desert and in italy are beautiful and so are the characters i am a romantic and am not ashamed to say i had tears after it ended watch it with someone you truly love the movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a woman's body and it was breathtaking the sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all the destruction of innocence br br anyway it deservedly won a bunch of oscars and i will go hunting for other works of director anthony it kind of brings back the romanticism in the david lean genre of films it almost reminds me of 'lawrence of arabia' which was also based in the desert happy viewing folks
