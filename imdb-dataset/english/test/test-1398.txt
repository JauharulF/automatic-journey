<START> empty shortening of john irving's novel strives for profundity courageously but ends up being absurd it's a quirky goofy and bittersweet string of sketches attempting to explain a man's growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother jenny fields played by glenn close the various stages of childhood are played by three young actors before robin williams takes over as garp reaches adulthood the story follows him through childhood at a boys' prep school where jenny is the school nurse through his high school passions wrestling writing and sex to marriage with his high school sweetheart children marital problems and a writing career jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist espousing an unorthodox cause the plot details an abundance of comic and episodes and outlandish adventures williams gives a cherub faced performance this script was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted he's like an injured bird sputtering out of control john lithgow's role as a father like transsexual imparting wisdom also doesn't make sense this movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982 due to the popularity of robin williams and his new entry into movies williams had recently shed his mork and mindy pursuits and focused more on stand up comedy and movies audiences were confused by this film especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending
<START> at the rate these movies are ploughing through the artifacts from the amityville house it won't be long before we get down to the but for now it's a mirror that's causing problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth entry in the series a homeless man hands it over to artist hairdo ross partridge who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past this mundane horror trundles along at a dull pace leaving us waiting for a build up that never comes as the various goings on lead to a dumb finale bland and lifeless with ropey acting and huge hair not helping matters
<START> this movie is so bad and hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great nothing is good bloodline a lot of gore but without meaning and the majority of time without originality the movie is about the past the present 1996 and the future of the puzzle box the creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon but nothing link up seriously the 3 stories pinhead is in the movie but it isn't pinhead he is just a boring bad guy who kidnap kids and kill bird and the worse he talk too much a thing that i really didn't understand is why the dog from hell he can't be a because he had nothing human why the dog can be killed by the pressure if the other creature from hell can receive bullets without problems bloodline is incoherent with the movie series in many ways for example pinhead and angelique are old friend in this movie but it's impossible that pinhead met angelique because pinhead is just a soldier from the first world war and angelique is an old demon and she live in paris since sometimes like 200 years
<START> seagal needs to get back to basics breaking bones and kicking butt no more of this slow motion crap like foreigner and in the shadows fighting like half past dead exit wounds showed more of his fighting skills with some wires which was ok but then he went back to b movie directors
<START> first of all there is a detective story by belgian andrÃ© whose au 21 clouzot had already transferred to the screen in 1942 with pierre fresnay and the same actress suzy complained about clouzot's adaptation for both movies the movie from 1942 was excellent but the detective story side had been kept so why complaining as for quai des clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career after having directed le and been blacklisted he had a lot more to say than a simple whodunit complained essentially about the poor detective ending which i will not reveal of course but clouzot focused on the social vignettes on his characters's psychology and he did not give a damn about the puzzle Ã  la agatha christie by doing so he becomes the genuine predecessor of claude chabrol who has always been closer to him than to alfred hitchcock whom he admires much though suzy has great screen presence and you will love the song she really sings she was a singer too avec son tralala bernard blier gives as ever a sparing of gestures and words performance and he really pulls it off two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing the first one dora the photographer she takes pictures of female models and clouzot by subtle touches reveals us she's a lesbian of course the word is never uttered how could it be in 1947 the police chief fabulous louis jouvet tells her you and me we are not lucky with women the portrait of this cop is very detailed we learn a lot of things about him not necessary connected with the blier plot he's a widower with a son he adores and who runs into school difficulties particularly in geometry so we get to know all the characters in depth one of the most important manifesto of post war french cinema
<START> i gave this show a chance because of white not for his character but mainly for the sonic the hedgehog voice xd so anyway like i said i gave it a chance and i was very fond of it i never cared for the character so i was pleased to see mr white in a role other than the ever so annoying nerd and his calvin j fraiser first called calvin but come the second episode everyone started calling him j was very entertaining and interesting br br i think my favorite episode was when j was dating the ex cowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid don't you talk that way 'bout my momma this is grown up talk you stay down there the only beef i have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters but mr white's character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two who are married always had the back stories it isn't exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes backseat to j having to babysit his girlfriend's dog br br other than that i really wish this show could have lasted a little longer it seems that people weren't interested in white as something other than the god awful annoying ass nerd known as br br hope they at least put it out as a dvd box set
<START> this movie is a pile of rubbish and to try and base it the first is just a farce the main thing that let it down for me was the usage of the one liners out of the first one which once said by classic actors such as sam elliot can not be reproduced in any way i mean when dalton phones wade in the 1st and he ends the call with stay cool that was great but when the chump rings the dea agent back home and he ends the call with stay cool it doesn't have the same ring now really does it there are other ones but i cant be bothered to post em up but i hope u get my drift they should of named this roadhouse wannabe
<START> the humor is non existent in this loser of a movie carrot top plays a surfer dude inventor who consistently blows the rent money on his goofy useless inventions then he helps an old guy broken down by the side of the road and voila he's inherited a major corporation and on and on and on past the jealous relatives humanizing the corporation hostile takeovers the obligatory love interest aargh let's just say this movie is virtually unwatchable what carrot top has accomplished is to convince me never to go to his stage shows
<START> the buddy holly story is a great biography with a super performance from gary busey busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job
<START> this story is an excellent tale of two boys that do whatever they can to get away from there abusive drunkard father lord of the rings star elijah wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role this movie is one of the main reasons i haven't touched a single beer and never will as long as i live that might make me sound like a nerd but that's what i have to say it is a wonder why this isn't as a classic american tale
<START> the gates of hell opened up and spit out this film then closed again br br watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies i have seen like all other movies nothing makes sense in this movie br br it would really take too long to mention all the plot problems in fact except as a warning it really isn't worth wasting some of the nearly infinite space available on the internet writing about this film br br from now on i will check imdb before watching any film br br hot darn imdb is forcing me to write more about this film i guess i should warn you about edison force while i am at it but if you had to chose between the two pick edison force
<START> directors of the danny pang and oxide pang are responsible for the eye and its sequel and their premiere american picture plays like the grudge lite set in a farmhouse a family of four move from chicago to a run down sunflower farm in rural north dakota almost immediately their teenage daughter jess starts seeing ghosts of course her parents and the police are skeptical admittedly the film is well made and there are two or three effective scares but relies too much on 'boo' effect still the plot is a carbon copy of many ghost stories and the ending is anti climatic and stupefyingly awful scares are on the low side too with a tendency toward cgi overall the is a pretty weak horror film that simply doesn't deliver 4 out of 10
<START> i was blown away when i saw the best years of our lives the acting script and master william wyler's direction winner of best director in 1946 is brilliant br br the film is about three world war ii veteran's who come home together on a plane and all by chance live in the same town they all are reunited with their families br br the first man al stephenson played by march in his oscar winning role has to adapt to his wife millie played by myrna loy and children peggy and rob played by teresa wright and michael hall being different than before he left for the war br br the second man fred derry played by dana andrews in an role has to find a good job and adapt to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war he begins to find out that she is not the same br br the third man has a much more harder adaptation to make homer parish played by harold russell in his oscar role he has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family's and fiance' played by cathy o'donnell reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands all of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scences the stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together br br this film truly defines the meaning of a classic this unforgettable drama winner of best picture in 1946 is a film that everyone should see br br if i was asked to pick a favorite film i would pick this one br br out of 10 i would give the best years of our lives an 11 br br so the next time you rent a movie rent this one you won't regret it
<START> a comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies the comebacks tells the story of an out of luck coach fields who takes a rag tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships in the process this life long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself saving his relationship with his family and friends and finding that there is indeed no i in team br br i decided to watch the unrated version for this film it was thirty minutes longer and i though it may be better than the theatrical release hearing that people hated this movie after all thirty minutes of extra footage can add a whole lot to a movie well i certainly was wrong it was as bad as the recent meet the spartans but it was thirty minutes more of torture br br seriously who makes a close to two hour spoof movie a spoof movie is short because if it goes any longer it would be overkill honestly i love stupid comedies heck i liked date movie white chicks epic movie and little man i guess when it comes to spoof movies it is either a hit or miss and this one definitely missed br br on the lighter side from the many jokes in this film i will say about six or seven made me laugh even some that made me laugh out loud but that's not saying much following those jokes were more scenes of torture and unfunniness br br i can't see how people would say this is not a terrible spoof film in fact there is as much product placement in here like meet the spartans there are as many dance sequences and unfunny jokes i will say another thing i like about this movie is the songs they are some very good songs in here overall watch it if you like spoof films skip it if you like funny films
<START> this game has cartoon graphics not much violence and really short levels then why do people say it is so brilliant because it always holds your attention it captivates you and refuses to let go you will try for hours to try and find that damn flight recorder try to work out how to get into the room without alerting the guards etc the levels are short only when you know what to do until that you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find where to find helicopters and so on and you'll have fun all the while you are doing it well worth a rent
