<START> for years i hesitated watching this movie now i know why it was even worse than i'd expected ashton kutcher makes the worst movie mistake of his career since 'dude where's my car ' tara reid co stars as the girl of dreams who asks him to babysit her father and his boss 's pet owl for the weekend the rules 1 no shoes in the house 2 no people in the house 3 the boss' son stays out of the house 4 don't touch the furniture br br well you can pretty much guess by the end of the first twenty minutes how the rest of the film is going to turn out br br you know there are films like meet the parents where bad things happen to someone but it's entertaining to watch and it's delivered in a way that you can't wait to see what happens next this is not one of those films you know right from the start that bad things are going to happen and they're mostly stupid things that would never actually happen it's an extremely frustrating movie to watch and there were about three times when i nearly turned it off because it was so bad but i paid the rental fee and figured i had to watch it now br br tara reid was good and i would like to see her in more films though i'm not surprised if this had a hand in hurting her career br br the end result is a happy ending but of course with the kind of film it is you would expect nothing short of that br br don't watch it you'll sincerely regret it
<START> this is a video version of a stage production with extra shooting for the video edition the result gains both the drama of the stage with the impact of well produced film the set by george with sculptures and masks by julie are superb br br norman is terrific and one gets to hear and see the young this production is stunning emotional and majestic if you don't see this you have missed out
<START> at least during its first half if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and tighter film the second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships but it's like a dull toothache getting there also don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it she has an important role but it's a small one br br the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good natured competition for the hand of sally ginger rogers a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue world war i breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet enlist in the navy anyways the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian bill boyd as baltimore winds up the commanding officer to the other two robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets to make matters more complex sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war br br the film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable however james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible br br one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or i should say the lack of it in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 no effort was taken to bring this film into period br br in conclusion if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission you've seen everything here worth seeing the rest is padding
<START> yes this is one of the greats of the black action genre confusing mixture of racist comedy and racist violence at times reaching a disturbing pitch even for a fan of the genre this movie isn't your shaft in the park wonderful bits of rudy ray moore comedy stand up that don't seem funny at least not to a white boy like me but great in context much better than its dissimilar sequel the human tornado
<START> when i was driving home after work i bought some movies for my four year old twins i had bought this movie my kids would enjoy i watched this with my children my 10 and 17 year old were about to throw up in this movie the dad acts like a tard my little ones would watch it every day one day they threw away all our movies i sold the jones movie on ebay my grade f i rather be seen on the worst dress list br br my kids now hate this dumb movie if gives the idea that germs can talk to each other i wonder how the dumb movie sounds in japenese i broke the cd in half when i got irritated of seeing it over and over again no offence but brandy acting was the best
<START> i've heard many things about beowulf maybe because i'm from romania and a good part of the movie was filmed here in my country and i expected a lot from this film at the end i was disappointed it is not as horrible as other users said but it's definetely bad it's all about a monster killing people in a 6th century castle and lambert the one who comes to kill him lambert is good as he is in all his roles but the rest of the characters suck and the action isn't too good either plus maybe the only thing that could've saved this film the special effects are also very bad the monster looks awful not scary but awful oh and another bad thing the music the movie tries and manages to create the 6th century atmosphere but all the action sequences are presented on rock music which is very very bad i mean action on rock works perfectly on a movie like charlie's angels where that's the perfect way to shoot your action but here that was a very bad idea br br vote 4 out of 10
<START> all movies that contain goofy sound effects should be shot if there is one thing i hate it's gotta be the use of a whoop whoop whoo when somebody gets hit one the head the only movies i have seen to do this is ghoulies iv and hobgoblins when they are in the bar and pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a beer bottle or rather fanning him with a beer bottle because she never really hits him with it yes ghoulies iv does suck but i have to wonder did they mean to not make the so called ghoulies mouths move when they supposedly talked their faces are almost as static as the masks used in trolls 2 hell i can make a better mask out of construction paper some rubber cement and a handful of glitter this sucked
<START> i just saw this at the toronto international film festival in the beautiful elgin theatre i was blown away by the beautiful cinematography the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky play and last but not least the bravura performance of al pacino who was born to play this role which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance from jeremy irons br br the film deftly explores the themes of love vs loyalty law vs justice and passion vs reason some might protest that the content is inherently anti semitic however they should consider the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is told in this adaptation br br 9 10
<START> another enjoyable warner flick i really liked john garfield in this though i'm wondering why cagney wasn't in the role perhaps it was too similar to angels with dirty faces i mean it's another dead end kids story of sorts too but i really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama the boys work great with garfield a nice sequence was the whole swimming scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster br br one negative comment claude rains was grossly miscast as the detective the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse
<START> four unhappy women leave dreary london to spend an enchanted april in a castle on the coast of italy br br elizabeth von arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting all the elements come together to produce a movie that although nearly forgotten now still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution br br the actresses each acquit themselves splendidly ann harding is the free spirited wife longing for far from foggy london katharine alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle jane baxter is the beautiful young temporarily escaped from her throng of male admirers jessie ralph steals every scene she's in as an old lady wanting only to be alone with her memories of the past br br the men in the story are also well cast as miss husband frank morgan has a rather complex role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer reginald owen as miss alexander's spouse is marvelously pompous as a man well equipped to bore for england his hilarious attempt to take an english bath in an italian bathtub is made even funnier with the assistance of charles judels rafaela ottiano as the castle's harried servants finally ralph forbes one of the decade's finest forgotten actors is joyously eccentric as the ladies' lighthearted landlord br br movie mavens will recognize an uncredited ethel playing the proprietress of the housewives club
<START> what garbage is there actually no part ii if this movie actually ends the way it did everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed this movie is nothing close to a movie like outbreak which was actually a fairly decent movie this movie was rushed in hopes of being able to gain a few easy dollars i started watching the movie under the assumption that it would be bad but i never imagined it would be this bad this movie was nothing more then a way to exploit the fears of the american people for profit if you have not seen this movie don't bother movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting i really hope the production of this movie was only a couple of weeks stay away don't be fooled by the hype
<START> if you took a really good jack black movie added a little jeepers creepers and then a dash of joyride with a hint of texas chainsaw massacre and house of a 1000 corpses you would have monster man i went into this movie not really expecting much at all but i wound up really enjoying the movie the whole premise is really cheesy a monster man in a monster truck chases down people but it is so funny that the writer director doesn't expect you to take it seriously justin urich is a comic gem and should have a very promising career he is identical to jack black the only problem with the film is the unbelievable hero role played by eric but overall if you are looking for a really really fun movie that will crack you up until you are rolling in the aisles and at the same time scare the crap out of you check out this film
<START> how many english 101 student's versions of 1984 must america endure gosh this is a great book but kind of a downer i know i'll write one just like it where everything works out okay i'll also replace orwell's old used up political insights from the thirties with my own insightful informed opinions form the 1970s think think political insight evil politicians i'm a genius and there will be clones that they make of themselves for some diabolical reason i'll work on that it'll work no it won't bob sullivan writer of this story this really is all you're fault you could have stopped them early and said guys with our budget and acting abilities i was thinking romantic comedy or we could move away form taking ourselves so seriously and make a campy spoof this tired familiar genre of movies did you do that though bob no you didn't and you've had 28 years to think about it br br i don't mean to be so spiteful i'm sorry i yelled at you bob you've obviously had to live with this mistake a lot longer then i have some blame really should go to ron smith who helped you adapt the screenplay he could have stopped you at any time you were young and naive and he took advantage of you now he wrights the plots for video games and you bob well who knows what you do i'm sorry if that sounds harsh bob but that's the way it is you were sold upriver by the hollywood hotshots as if ron wasn't enough michael bay also saw your movie and without even asking for rights or anything added some explosions to your concept and turned it into the island that i think is the most disgusting part of all that with a little eye candy your script could of easily been good enough for a major hollywood production which i'd of hated just as much as this movie and not felt sorry for you at all br br i'm sorry things worked this way for you bob ron and michael walked all over you leaving you a withered shell of a man who's height of movie writing greatness will be a joke on mystery science theater 3000 don't focus on that though bob because karma works in mysterious ways and one day they'll pay for what they did to poor little bob sullivan
<START> this is a candidate for worst films i've ever seen it wanted to be as shocking as silence of the lambs but has neither the style nor the wit of the aforementioned the make up is excellent the acting is pretty good but the story seems to drag on for years and the murders are so gruesome that they're more disturbing than entertaining
<START> poor jane austen this dog of a production does not do her wonderful tongue in cheek novel any justice starting at the top poorly adapted the screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying to come to think of it i don't know what she was trying for but suffice it to say she missed the mark by light years couple that with all the over acting and awful production values this is one adaptation that should never have happened it would have been far better if they just gave all the money they poured into this flop and donated it to a worthy charity do yourself a favor read the book it is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this excruciating production
