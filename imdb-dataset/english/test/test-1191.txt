<START> adam eric and obnoxious best friend harley justin urich are driving cross country to a wedding along the way they pick up sexy hitchhiker sarah aimee brooks then for no reason a monster truck keeps trying to run them off the road and maybe kill them who is doing this and why br br pretty good horror film its energetic and full of flashy direction which gets you right into the action it's also a horror comedy most of the humor is infantile and really gross but actually somewhat funny also this movie really piles on the gore at times but that's a good thing the acting is ok overplays his nerd role a bit much urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the foul mouthed sex obsessed best friend but pulls it off brooks is good too in a limited role br br but i could see the twist ending coming long before it happened and logic totally disappears at the end especially the rescue still this is a gory sometimes funny and sometimes scary horror movie i give it a 7
<START> everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends family who had a stake in the film and that's okay if i'd made a movie all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it too in all honesty there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie unfortunately the bad things far outweigh the good good the overall plot was mildly interesting the music was overall pretty good several of the songs when you could hear them were actually pretty cool the only musical issues i had were 1 the first suspense scene with some sort of quiet instrumental it really seemed to take away from the suspense 2 the song being played when the lead characters went to an outdoor party at a friend's house and 3 the songs that were good were too quiet especially when a heavy metal song was playing in the background while danny trejo hung a man sounded like a pretty cool song but it should have ripped out across the scene when danny trejo got now for the completely bad stuff the script was atrocious i mean horrible i've seen smoother dialogue in a star wars movie advice to the writer from a part time writer and full time movie buff when you write dialogue ask yourself is this something that people would actually say honestly the script was laughable i want to slam the acting but with that kind of writing it's hard to know if they have talent or not the mildly interesting plot was seriously hampered by the crappy dialogue i know it was low budget but words don't cost money if you have a good script even semi competent actors can pull it off this movie didn't seem to have either but hopefully the director will get a second shot at making a better film
<START> my paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the dvd box sums it up this film was far more horrible than horrifying br br this is the worst film i have seen in as long as i can remember my wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the tom cruise version the laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off the gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious br br but as the film wore on we were benumbed by clumsy acting both over and under acting non continuity in directing and editing trite writing and crude special effects we gave up after a half hour or less after starting this badly it couldn't possibly get better br br since i despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments even if they amount to spoilers br br the lead says good bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother the latter prickly because it's their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business the son asks quietly worried will i ever see you again perhaps it's supposed to come off as a premonition but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation br br a huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater a crowd of people stands nearby peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally one woman finally says it's gi br br after this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants the lead and a bystander now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape have an exchange something like this in a quietly puzzled tone br br what was that thing anyway i dunno br br a crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military since part of the bridge is destroyed when an alien ship shoots an explosive at it the crowd starts to run away seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger let alone unusual circumstances br br and so forth writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it but please please save yourself the bother even if your morbid curiosity is piqued the film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor versus say king vidor's solomon sheeba starring yul brynner wearing a wig life is too short to waste watching such nonsense there must be something more productive and enjoyable to do like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage
<START> whoops looks like it's gonna cost you a whopping 00 to buy a copy either dvd or video format from itv direct br br ouch br br sorry about this but imdb won't let me submit this comment unless it has at least 10 lines so br br br br
<START> i watched this film during a special advanced preview in reading br br the two main characters michael and rory strike up a friendship when rory is introduced to the care home that michael already resides michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him as until now his palsey made people think that he couldn't communicate br br rory introduces michael to the life that he's missing rory is a feisty character who doesn't let his condition muscular dystrophy get to him br br they bond and apply for independent living and find a lovely flat and assistant and have all the fun that they could ever dream of br br don't go to see this film if you are after some entertainment do go see this film if you're willing to see something a little different br br the storyline is strong the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the film the mood is uplifting br br i thoroughly recommend it though if you are anything like me and prone to crying take tissues as you'll need them
<START> charlie wilson's war is an excellent example of how films should be made this movie is of the highest quality and is cast perfectly tom hanks play the lead and delivers an exceptional performance furthermore tom hanks is complimented by the unparalleled acting ability of the incredible philip seymour hoffman i have never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly br br the film is witty intelligent and well written julia roberts also stars in this film but is easily over shadowed by the other two leads br br i rated this film 10 10 and am pleased to recommend this film to anyone that is interested in quality cinema
<START> i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in pablo co i had just quit my engineering job at a hospital i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals br br the idiots that put it down on production value don't get the point and probably have never been hospitalized and never worked in one for sure billy jack same era was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message br br i have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site i have found where it get mentioned
<START> being a great fan of disney i was really disappointed when i watched this garbage the animation was pretty and the backgrounds were amazing but i believe that good animation does not make up for a weak script and weak story i'm gonna have to disagree with the people who say it is not suitable for children yes there are some deaths in the movie but isn't death something that children should at least be exposed to but i digress the script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokes the kind i could expect from most dreamworks movies the music was soppy the morals forced and forced without any charm whatsoever and the characters would burst into song at totally inappropriate times the characters were also cold and i really couldn't muster up any form of emotion towards them bar irritation i am a great fan of jungle book aladdin and new groove but this disney movie was a total and utter waste of time do not watch it
<START> this is one of barbara stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme she's making money by dancing with men at a dance hall she really doesn't like the work but it's a living her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy but she's also pursued by rich guy ricardo cortez well after marrying it turns out her nice guy is a thieving womanizing weasel and rich cortez turns out to be a heck of a guy by the end of the film barbara simply has had enough as any sane woman would walk from this horrid marriage br br in the 1920s and early 30s hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today such as nudity adultery and bad language while ten cents a dance isn't a blatant example of this morality it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened production code was created and enforced starting in 1934 in some ways the code was great after all parents didn't need to worry about what their kids saw in films such as nudity in ben hur 1925 however it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce a serious no no 1934 and thereafter this is really a shame as i don't think ten cents a dance was bad at all to discuss this especially since the star barbara stanwyck was married to a philandering thief even so allowing the film to end with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just couldn't have been br br overall the film is interesting and thought provoking plus it was well paced and suited its relatively short run time give this one a look br br fyi sadly ricardo cortez was actually not hispanic but changed his name because of possible prejudice because he was jewish he was an excellent leading man of his time but today is all but forgotten
<START> the dreams of are to be feared when the right hemisphere of his characters overpowers the left shocking images of blood dismemberment and various abominations are released religion won't save you nor will mother nature or your own family dark poetry because that's what this film really is all institutions of sanctuary br br is a current crowd pleaser on the horror fantasy festival circuit the film's opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound the protagonist's desire to profane the birthing process which brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrific and credible illogic from here the film continues deeper into the and tackles mother nature offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness nature is exposed as blood drenched and violent in frightening enlightenment br br is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature themes of life lust and madness this very worthy film explores cj goldman deserves kudos for his special make up as do david for unnerving sound design and suzuki for score
<START> this is one of the stooges best shorts it was the only one of their shorts to be nominated for an oscar in this short the stooges play doctors who cause some trouble as usual this short has non stop sight gags puns and jokes the part at the end where the stooges are breaking apart the machine this is definitely a classic i would highly recommend this three stooges short
<START> i saw this when i was twelve it was the movie that made me understand what a good mystery really was i had read the entire happy children's mystery series and they were about a family of child sleuths who always got their man but we the readers were not in a position to solve the mystery along with them this movie showed me that a good mystery is that which makes the viewer reader at the end say oh of course
<START> there is really but one thing to say about this sorry movie it should never have been made the first one one of my favourites an american werewolf in london is a great movie with a good plot good actors and good fx but this one it stinks to heaven with a cry of helplessness br br
<START> today i had a real craving for a sci fi movie and so i decided to check out sadly that was one of my biggest mistakes this year br br i see that the director neil johnson has directed over 500 music videos and i suggest he goes back to that music videos are a perfectly good form of entertainment and not everybody can cut it making movies br br the worst part of this movie is probably the voice over and that says a lot since the special effects are appalling at times voice over didn't work in blade runner and it doesn't work here the first hour or so is spent watching the main character walk through the desert while her daughter tells the story i think the story could have made a great movie but not like this br br the second worst part are the effects they are simply bad and they don't blend into the rest of the picture at all so you simply don't believe in them and absolutely all the frames in the movie has been filtered and not in a good way filtering used as an effect is good 90 minutes of it bad br br and what is it with all the gadgets talking all the time and not shutting up if i had used technology like that i would have gone mad i was just waiting for the guns to blurt out with i am awfully sorry but i seem to have run out of ammunition no stay away this movie is just not worth the time
<START> probably grossly underrated by all who never experienced the hell of living under communist regime although it seems hard to believe all of it happened actually the reality was even worse than the movie it resembles orwellian fiction only this is no fiction john hurt is excellent as always yes the screenplay is not full of action but life is not either plot is breathtaking yes people were shot yes thousands of them their was that they wanted to leave communist without government at times the movie drives tears in your eyes we need more movies like this to really appreciate what america provides for us excellent movie highly recommend god bless our country usa
