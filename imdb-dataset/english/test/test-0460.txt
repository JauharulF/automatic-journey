<START> adapting his own novel cabal for the screen author screenwriter director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of outrÃ© horror and fantasy craig sheffer plays boone a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer the cops gun him down in front of on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own this causes repercussions for everybody including boone's sweet girlfriend the very cute anne bobby and dubious psychiatrist a most enjoyable david cronenberg br br displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i don't see in movies all that often for one thing ralph mcquarrie an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three star wars entries helps barker to create excellent visuals for starting right away with the opening credit sequence the visual and makeup effects are elaborate and production design and cinematography quite impressive barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters it's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in and of course there's the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions br br great supporting performances add to the fun cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor while charles haid is a fine love to hate him type of antagonist a rather nasty police captain doug pinhead bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary and is solid as a rock hugh ross is great fun as as is catherine chevalier as rachel as an added bonus she bares her breasts in one sequence simon who played the in the first two hellraiser pictures turns up here as well there's even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci fi star john agar br br danny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdown br br is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasn't seen it i give it a hearty recommendation br br 9 10
<START> during my teens or should i say prime time i was eating up all kinds of sf novels every day of the week it was in the sixties and seventies when tv was not such a important leisure time killer like today one night in the mid seventies i watched the movie on tv i think it was and i was stunned i was impressed in a way that i can almost remember each scene even today br br nowadays i observe my kids playing the sims or something like that and i think we are close to what that movie expressed i also would highly appreciate if i could buy this movie on a dvd but in vain i tried almost everything to get a hint where the movie matrix cannot touch by far the quality and the state of art of this movie and by the way by now we do not have a glue if we were a superior reality or just one of a couple simulation models probably after our death we definitely will know
<START> years ago i read the book 'a the machine as i re read this little book again and again i could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the brazilian culture br br when i knew about the movie i was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books well happily my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art br br i can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text also i can't recall such a powerful performance like br br you can see and feel how colossal his love for is you can realize that he'll move mountains and do anything for this love br br do see this movie watch it thru the eyes of the kid that lives inside you enchant yourself
<START> one wonders about the state of a society that produce a father like albert t fitzgerald who we first meet on a plane as he is heading toward the place he abandoned a long time ago and where he left a wife and a child who is now accused of murdering a mentally challenged boy when we first see him he has caught a headline in the paper the woman in front of him is reading rather rudely he asks her if he could have the newspaper and the lady offers other sections well that's not what he asked what he wants the woman to do is to give him the front section she is reading br br matthew ryan wrote and directed this disturbing film that reflects in many ways our society as it is today in fact mr is pointing out exactly at what is wrong with it br br the film presents leland a teen ager who can't even differentiate between fantasy and reality it's evident that killing a human being even the sweet and innocent boy who hasn't done anything to deserve it will have fatal consequences not only for himself but for his own family and the family of the slain boy in fact leland seems to have no idea about what motivated him to commit the crime for he does not show any repentance about it br br it's obvious leland has been traumatized by his parents divorce his own father is an aloof man who couldn't care less about him it's pearl the teacher in the juvenile detention center who sees the turmoil inside the young man and wants to help but unfortunately he doesn't have a chance br br the best thing in the film is don cheadle a great actor who always delivers the ensemble cast does good work under mr direction kevin spacey has a good opportunity playing the egotistical father of the accused murderer and makes us detest him for being an arrogant idiot br br although a bit long the film leaves us with more questions than what it answered
<START> this is in short the tv comedy series with the best cast ever and the most likable also each one of them is a comedy actor i know only one tv series which was better i e moonlighting one had willis as a it had willis only while the king of queens has a pocketful of actors that are as fine as one can enjoy kevin james leah jerry stiller patton nicole sullivan victor williams gary valentine and even all the rest of them Â i spontaneously and continually and promptly liked it advancing age didn't spoil the fun anyway br br in a few words the series is intelligent and original miraculously spared of the current tv stupidity and garbage it is politically incorrect and doesn't court the minorities in the usual disgusting way br br the comic is very palatable and savory br br i read mostly a few imdb writers and sometimes they write about their favorite though these writers are several i did not encountered at any of them the slightest mention of my favorite tv shows but it's true that the critics one likes are not those with whom he finds himself in complete those who at least offer a common basis for disapproval are mainly wild wild west moonlighting queens the '80s twilight zone bradbury's tv show and most of them i have seen when i was yrs about a few of them i have written and execrably
<START> somehow lost out in the afi awards to my brother jack the latter a high quality adaptation of george johnston's immortal novel was outstanding but in my opinion not as good as i have heard that many critics dismissed as being irrelevant unimportant historically inaccurate or even disrespectful who and where are these critics is outstanding more than that brilliant it's not supposed to be a documentary certainly i can forgive the actual survivors or indeed any survivors of a pow camp for being disappointed with the production but to the rest of us represents the remarkable power of in times of extreme adversity it contains a part of the australian culture that appears to be diminishing as times become easier and less challenging but which we should never forget australians were respected worldwide after gallipoli and ww2 for their comradery and sense of humour rating 96 100 see also gallipoli paradise road the last bullet the sugar factory
<START> he who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster and if you gaze for long into an abyss the abyss gazes also into you br br yes this is from nietzsche's 146 from beyond good and evil and that's what you find at the start of this movie br br if you watch the whole movie you will doubt if it was the message that the ram gopal varma production wanted to pass on as the scenes crop up one by one quite violent and at times puke raking the viewer is expected to forget the nietzsche quote and think otherwise that to deal with few people you need dedicated people like who will have the licence to kill anyone not just writing something unworthy of the police to do as we are made to believe br br when was and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws rgv's satya did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like india within a year was passed br br when real life encounter specialist a monster on the path of fighting them' and was himself booked by tak was made to heed out false impression among the people about this with it's you have to be a monster to save your nation approach br br and people consumed it no questions raised only praises and hopes that they get a in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over blood you can ignore br br every time israel attacks palestine or lebanon we hear voices like india must also similarly attack pakistan this movie is made for such psychopaths if you don't give them this they will probably die out of boredom and lsd and what not br br hence this game of the passion of hatred
<START> although the film does have a fairly stylish look for an indie made on a really low budget that's not what i go to movies for there wasn't one character i found sympathetic they all seemed to be absolutely clueless losers everything they attempt ends badly it's all too hopeless for me reviews refer to the puffy chair as a black comedy comedy the brother rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution when josh talks to girl friend emily about his brother he almost hints at rhett not playing with a full deck nonetheless josh performs a wedding for rhett and a woman rhett met just a few hours before there were a few interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road however for me the most telling thing was that people were walking out of the film and i saw it at a free screening
<START> the topics presented are very interesting suburban culture suburban sprawl public transportation oil gas depletion energy dependence alternative energy sources etc br br the problem is that this is a pure and shameless propaganda piece one viewpoint is presented then hammered upon the viewer over and over you see the same handful of repeatedly making their case the supposed starts off sounding like a news reporter but by the end even he is preaching the film's dogma br br the dark side of the film is not so much the gloom and doom message about oil depletion but the sense that the folks in the film are actually wishful for a post oil society and all that it entails they paint this picture of a utopian society where we all return to the self contained local village model walk to work shop locally grow our own food and generally live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle for them the post oil society would seem a grand vision of a better world it would certainly spell the end of globalization and better still the end of walmart i will give them some credit for applying actual math in exposing the weaknesses of several over touted alternative energy sources including and hydrogen br br i gave it 3 stars because i appreciated the old footage and the premise
<START> i wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to european wimps and the united nations what a load of right wing crud incidentally the bit about canada joining the us didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed the only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for president but they could have just made him american and dispensed with that in any event this was a load of bull and not worth your time if you wan't to see this kind of thing done well check out the brilliant bbc political thriller state of play
<START> i recall years back michael douglas wanted his wife catherine zeta jones to be in a romantic film because he felt his wife had all the goods no doubt she does but not in this film a colossal waste of time no story no character development no chemistry nada this was not the vehicle that we all hoped this film would be boring and a huge disappointment didn't even watch the whole film torture catherine zeta jones was obviously trained in how to work a kitchen move around present a dish but this wasn't the food network nothing learned here and once her counterpart appeared supposedly a romantic interest brewing where was the chemistry the poor slob on the second floor of her building trying all the ploys to connect and no character development there the loss of her sister was poorly played out as who knew there was a closeness the sister's daughter just was plopped here and there with something that was supposed to draw you in not just a waste of movie time the promoters certainly did their job to put this lack luster film on all the networks tempting you with all kinds of teasers sorry to say don't spend a dime
<START> curse of monkey island is a treasure in my opinion the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure gaming not to mention br br but to return to curse whats beautiful about is that its not afraid to be itself it does deviate from the first two but still remains faithful to the ron gilbert productions if only the same could be said about the 4th installment of the series the voice work is impeccable with dominic playing our favorite protagonist the animation while quite different than the classic pixelated characters is done beautifully it really is just absolutely gorgeous and the music is fantastic its never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off br br although i'm not too big a fan of romance the romantic scenes and themes are not at all overpowering they also have the rare ability to come off as sweet instead of cheesy that says a lot from a girl who routinely falls asleep during chick flicks br br then of course is the classic mi element of humor is quite adept at delivering deadpan lines altogether absurdist humor and simply good fun gary coleman makes a cameo as a budding young entrepreneur and world events are discreetly jabbed at without stepping out of the bounds of the game br br its not entirely fair to compare to mi and because it truly is in a realm of its own personally i can never find a favorite between the 3 as they all are quite different from each other however if you want a swashbuckling good time with the flair of the classic series i insist you give this game a shot you will not be disappointed br br 10 10 stars hands down br br emily n
<START> may contain spoilers this movie is the epitome of weirdness i rented it hoping for a film so bad it would be funny however i still honestly can't decide if this film was intended to be scary or humorous it combines the emotions in a rather disturbing way apparently this is trying to be clever but in actual fact it isn't for instance when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher it starts playing happy music when we go to we have up beat quasi mr roger's neighborhood music however when the little kid's dreaming of falling in blood and when he finds the leg these are clearly intended to be tense so watch this film and decide for yourself it is too weird to be described in words and for that i say kudos br br nose dive wow
<START> just above the box i am typing in now i was required to pick a number between 1 and 10 and rate this feature film unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero and i have to put something if i had my choice i would just put nothing no number because there exist no digits that express the worthlessness of this movie br br if you do decide to watch this film even after reading all of these horrible reviews make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area this will help prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the film br br i don't know how this film was released to the public it should be locked up and guarded 24 7 somewhere in fort knox i am angry that this film was even available for me to watch i feel cheated by humanity i had no idea humans could be this cruel stalin saddam and hitler got nothing on this douche bag br br do not be fooled by the movie's cover 1 there are no scarecrows no one knows why there is a legit looking scarecrow on the front 2 none of the characters on the back of case are even in the stinking movie 3 the tag line says something about new moon more victims there were no frigging victims no one even died we don't know if the dam cop died and i'm assuming the killer didn't die because it sounded like he was being hit over the head with a frigging ball bat br br do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie it wasted about 4 hours of my life that's right four it took an hour for me to watch it i fast forwarded thru the 4 minute zooming scenes that reveal nothing in the plot i stared at the television for about an hour after it was over contemplating my life and the direction it was heading after watching this crap and then i began to cry for the next two hours because i know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing i can do to stop it
<START> the cheesiest movie i've ever seen not scary just bad 1st movie made by the wwe and trust me the only person this movie might appeal to is wrestling fans it has terrible acting and the worst directing i've seen yet i found myself laughing at the storyline and bad actors i saw that the wwe people tried really hard to put a lot of the wrestling moves in the kills and several camera effects i think they copied a lot from silent hill this movie's not engaging either so if you do see it you're gonna find yourself tuning out because of it's lack of suspense the ending's the worst no matter what you'll come out wanting your money back
