<START> lovely music beautiful photography some of scenes are breathtaking and affecting but the dramatic tension is lost in a film that is so poorly edited it is hard to know what exactly is going on at times the dialogue is incomprehensible then there is richard gere he's supposed to be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets work on a farm we see dozens of sweaty and dirty in the hot sun then we see gere looking like he just wandered away from a calvin klein ad sam shepard another glamour guy is supposed to be terminally ill but he looks great nice try but it just doesn't work brook adams try hard but she gets lost in the scenery the real star is the girl
<START> i was a huge snl fan back in the days of chevy chase john belushi dan ackroyd gilda and many other memorable stars but every time i've tried to watch it in the past more than ten years i've been very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted with it ten years ago i believed the show couldn't possibly survive since it had become so utterly bereft of the sort of humor i could understand and yet it kept plugging along which i've always found dismaying wondering how in the world anyone could possibly find its lame humor at all funny whenever i've tuned in over the past decade i've never once been glad that i did indeed i've always been annoyed at myself for staying up and wasting my time for me the absolute low point came several years ago when a popular young male actor i liked a lot was the guest host at one point that night he played a big star perhaps himself and in the skit the character i think played by chris kattan again i think ended up in the backseat of a car with him what followed was being forced up and down and up and down on the actor's lap with him screaming hysterically as he was presumably sodomized the audience was laughing their heads off and i'm shaking my head amazed that they could find that remotely funny amazed that nbc would even broadcast such a thing in the years since then i've repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind hoping that it might regain the sly sense of humor i adored for so many years but up until just a week ago for me it hasn't done so not even close one exception during the 2008 presidential campaign i thought that tina fey was fantastic and she was the one performer who kept me tuning in but those sarah palin skits while hysterical were still not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes and i would always regret not turning it off as soon as i heard the familiar it's 'saturday night '
<START> once again i am amazed that thomas gibson did not come to the head of the pack earlier in his career in this film gibson once again demonstrates his ability to grasp a character regardless of sexuality social status or nationality gibson plays a very convincing gay male of the late 20th century tender yet not effeminate afraid of the basic tenets of love gibson's character touches a variety of emotions also worthy of praise is cameron bancroft's performance his need to be the heterosexual conqueror as opposed to his best friend's homosexual conquests provides dynamics for the relationship that are in many ways unexpected bancroft and gibson's chemistry is apparent from the first scene they appear in together there are many panels in this quilt from gay relationships to straight relationships from heterosexual relationships to the exploration of lesbian love this film travels across the broad spectrum of sexuality while having the story of a serial killer at its core my only regret is that it took 6 years since its release before i discovered this movie i look forward to seeing it again and highly recommend it to any fan of bancroft gibson or director denys arcand
<START> if you enjoyed the tv series diagnosis murder you'll love murder 101 it's great to see dick van dyke in a murder mystery again if we're lucky this one will be a start of a tv series or at least series of movies br br this movie definitely had some great and notable actors filling the roles but it didn't feel like a face movie it was really a story that drew you in making you forget about the fame of those on the screen br br i made a guess as to the ending and was so pleasantly surprised at the end that i had to watch it again this is a must see for any mystery buff or dick van dyke lover
<START> glenn close is back as sarah plain and tall a woman who keeps a family together through the good and bad times the acting is superb christopher walken unusually non spooky as her husband once again delivers a top notch performance it's good to see young christopher bell all grown up too bad we don't get to see much of anna lexi randall also a few years older but the new addition to the family played by emily osment was very welcome and finally jack palance as the long lost patriarch is as fine as ever
<START> how many movies are there going to be in which against all odds a ragtag team beats the big guys with all the money there's nothing new in the big green if anything you want them to lose steve guttenberg used to have such a good resume the boys from brazil police academy cocoon why oh why did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond so just avoid this movie there are plenty of good movies out there so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this junk obviously the green on their minds was money because there's no creativity here at least in recent years disney has produced some clever movies with pixar
<START> don't buy this film for comedy value like i did i didnt find it one bit funny but so f miserable and lame it's unbelievable i gave it to a friend for christmas which was pretty funny on my side i recently heard that he watched it and told me what an a i am br br there is nothing more frustrating than watching an over lit over dramatic poorly scored scene in which the camera is sat there on a tripod and doesn't move the film work is truely pathetic and i can only say dont watch this movie
<START> first i will say that i am going to be as subjective as i can br br there will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware br br i hardly ever review movies but this one in particular i felt i had to review this movie final fantasy 7 advent children based off the ultra popular rpg final fantasy vii for the ps1 has been in the works for quite some time after the years of hype and the dozens of trailers none of which i ever saw i had only seen stills this movie got the legions of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen i myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself so i had thought to myself what could go wrong br br well the movie started out ok in the first 20 minutes but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed without a doubt this is the best looking cgi animation around but that won't help a weak plot undeveloped characters and over indulgent action scenes br br here is the story basically these three silver haired nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game are supposedly clones of he's the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed clones are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well probably to make an army of kids they also center some of the story on some kid named denzel i don't know who this kid is or what his point is he just seems depressed all the time so the clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called that only affects the children this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin br br so now cloud must save the day from these guys apparently cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time maybe if the movie wasn't so over the top then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible the real problem of this movie is logic now i know what you are gonna say but it's called final fantasy it should have those ideas in it well that is a foolish way to think the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that context context and logic in this movie is inconsistent i could explain it all but if i did i would end up writing the screenplay br br also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans they show up do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story br br if this is too long here is the simpler review br br the pros the first 20 minutes top notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunning br br the cons illogical over indulgent action unbalanced action leaves the viewer jaded at the climax weak plot super human characters no suspense the j rock soundtrack score what happened to the orchestra horrible ending br br big time spoiler br br now the ending of this movie really disappointed me they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of now i remember the in the game but it did not have resurrecting properties if it did they could have brought back to life thus making a completely different story so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark lifetime type moment br br not that the movie doesn't have it's moments its is worth seeing for its visuals but thats all br br other than that it's not really a good movie it is strictly for blinded fans of the game not for people who care about plot and character and story telling
<START> cat in the brain is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview describing director lucio fulci's most notorious years of film making the movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life fulci goes further than that he casts himself as the star the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore cat in the brain is not about presenting a clear story and following it instead it pokes fun at some of the clichÃ©s that have been surrounding the horror genre for years br br lucio fulci plays himself as a horror director struggling to keep his humanity intact years of violent film making have finally began to reach him it starts slowly and meat in general begin to disgust him his colleagues assure fulci that all he needs is some rest but that doesn't help and soon the grotesque ideas for his movies begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts in an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously maddening mental state lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist unfortunately that does more wrong than good and fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the murders from fulci's films in real life br br the film retains all the trademarks of italian splatter cinema good or bad they are all here so any comments about the acting or the technical aspects and budget constrains are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film it is a visual experience no doubts about it fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily surpassing pretty much everything he's made amputated by chainsaw limbs cannibalism child murder decapitation these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in cat in the brain some of them are obviously recycled from a few the director's less profile movies but they don't stand out of the context and actually feel quite at home here as i noted before the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece the way some of the violence is presented does help establish that idea such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality in the film as they are revealed to be actually scenes inside a movie that fulci's character is directing this sort of film in film presentation lessens somewhat the impact of the gore but in no way does it make it an easy to watch film oh no this is far beyond and above the levels of gore found in mainstream horror and gorehounds will in no doubt be satisfied with that fact br br lucio fulci was a very polarized figure people either hate his work or love it cat in the brain won't convince any of fulci's detractors in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography one that fans should really check out
<START> is the boob in the pie every thing else in it is an abortion a malformed failure of a film at least you can see and hear what goes on in an ed wood movie usually high schools drama clubs do better than this on a routine basis once you've you've seen the breast pie bit you can turn it off and go watch hannibal
<START> this must rank as one of cinema's greatest debacles i was wandering europe at the time and had the misfortune to stumble upon the crew making this movie in what was even then one of the world's idyllic unspoiled settings i was enlisted as an extra and what followed was an exhibition of modern day debauchery forget all the accusations you've ever heard of peter mayall's intrusions on this rare piece of french life geoff reeve and his cohorts embarked on a level of revelry at the restaurant at les beaux that left the slack jawed in disbelief they were quite simply awful uncultured and undeserving of french hospitality
<START> this was one of christie's later stories throughout her long career she was interested in the shifting narrative and the notion of conflicting agents both are essentially the same thing and boil down to questions of who it is that controls or creates the situation br br in detective fiction the game is a matter of conflicting realities the murderer intends to change reality to fool the detective the writer intends to do the same to the reader both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see that's why her stories often include a writer br br in her works she explores every combination of tricks she can think of that deal with this along the way we often have bodies that are not who they seem and times and intended victims and such but the real magic of the books is this notion of control in it was literally a building br br here it is a dead man well sometimes that happens but not like this it is as if the writer were the famous mr this is particularly sweet to marple readers who remember this same character from the mystery ' which in a way was also framed by her nephew in that story was the conveyor of the story to the authorities br br the producers of this series have an almost wacky commitment to using a different creative team on each one sometimes it produces bland work the episode was rather brilliantly staged this one is the most lavish of the lot and has an active camera but unlike the work it has nothing to do with the story br br the camera moves and captures merely because it can the 'citizen kane' quote at the beginning was a little too literal and blunt this story is good but the adapter took out some pretty critical stuff and that irrelevant camera annoys br br ted's evaluation 2 of 3 has some interesting elements
<START> this is a funny film and i like it a lot cary elwes plays robin hood to a tee this is of course the usual good vs evil with robin against the evil sheriff of nottingham the humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part but still works well a comedy for a night when you don't want to have to think much it's well worth a rent
<START> br br in the process of boring you with the wordy rambling storyline and the complete absence of character development it manages to enforce a few negative black stereotypes out there at one point i was wondering if jesse helms co wrote the screenplay
<START> i'm new to argento's work and if this and suspiria are any indication then argento is much more a filmmaker of experience than story in his films characters are placed in grueling and mesmerizing horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them the camera literally flows gracefully through sets as the characters run stumble and choke their way to an eventual horrifying conclusion it worked really well in suspiria for some reason it didn't work here br br the problem i see with this movie is that even though the protagonist gets help by way of contacting the police and asking for help from her friends it still feels as if she refuses to get help in terms of actually trying to find a solution to her problem the entrapment in this film is that she's trapped in the killer's little game one that she could easily get out of by not setting herself up so easily in a weird way it seems like the character wants the torture the killer gives her which in a way is the point and could have worked except that the whole psychology of it is thrown about mostly due to whatever argento feels like doing br br as a loving homage to the phantom of the opera it's certainly an interesting and unique take for all his worth argento delights in operatic movements as well which well highlights the action it just doesn't make much sense especially as it delves further into a completely useless ending yes i know it's a reference to harris' novel red dragon no it didn't work why the character should go from one horrifying experience of entrapment to a willing one with the director is beyond me it felt almost self serving on argento's part br br overall a fun experience and between this and suspiria i'm more than willing to follow up on more argento productions but this is not a movie i'd want to return to or remember br br polarisdib
