<START> in the squire of kirk and his crew encounter a powerful super being who keeps the captain bones and a few captive for no apparent reason i could be wrong but i think this is the first star trek episode i ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more it is not one of the best episodes but the rock solid premise of an alien being who putting the crew in a corner is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch in a way the super humanoid anticipates one of star trek's most famous characters next generation's enigmatic q this episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation it is the first time uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character can be when the story allows her too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure
<START> this good guy vs the evil tyrant story set in 19th century russia may have been an attempt to extend steve reeves' career beyond those hercules movies however despite the different costumes it's still a hercules movie with the usual stilted dialog haphazard dubbing and cardboard characters on the other hand there's lots of action the pace rarely flags and reeves gets to do yet another one of those scenes where he's stripped to the waist bound with ropes and given a vigorous whipping which needless to say has little effect on his defiant character
<START> this is a poor poor movie full of clichÃ©s unrealistic moments punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out never mind that someone's lost their home and possessions announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships the very dodgy cheesy music at the end the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment did they have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something anyone with an ounce of wit can see that this movie was a joke it's a pity because firefighters do an awesome job and they deserve to have a good movie made about what they do but not at the expense of common sense
<START> this is another of robert altman's underrated films let's be honest the only movie he's made that really didn't work was ready to wear and sandy dennis gives a spellbinding performance in it she is far better here than she was in the out of towners the material i will admit is beneath the great director altman and the extraordinary actress dennis but that hardly matters anyway as long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well just about any story will do
<START> have i seen a worse movie no i can't say that i have this was pathetic if the director is still alive 1 he shouldn't be 2 he should be ashamed 3 god how i would like to take out my 2 completely wasted hours of time on his a br br to give you guys a few pointers of the film br br 1 i'm a male and i would rather give myself a on the opening of my before viewing this again seriously br br 2 it does have a few known names in it casper van dien erika eleniak coolio they don't help and their careers in cinema after this film are officially over by the way br br 3 the dialog is the worst i've ever heard i want to ejaculate on your what kind of writer did they have on this film was he still using hooked on and just got his letters mixed up to make these horrible sentences or was he trying to get the director killed by the few people who saw this br br 4 watch this film backwards because i promise you that you do not want to watch it forwards br br 5 this film would make helen keller get up and walk out of the theater br br 6 the set of the movie looks like an adult sized mcdonald's i was just waiting for this so called dracula to fall in the ball pit at some time in the movie br br 7 also i like that in the year 3000 they still have headsets with wires that go to their mouth no bluetooth no wireless headsets no chips placed in the brain but they use headsets borrowed from a agency that went out of business in 1983 nice job set director on this one real professional i hope you're currently unemployed and reading this br br 8 i don't know who was in charge of special effects but i could have done better in my backyard with my vhs camcorder that doesn't have a battery br br 9 i was a devout catholic before this film but since viewing it i know there is not a god because if there was he wouldn't have let this film be produced i am now an atheist br br 10 i'll be honest i can't talk about the ending last time i tried to explain it i fell into a coma br br folks however bored you get however curious or brave you are however many laughs you think you will get out of this movie please do not watch this it has literally ruined my life avoid at all costs br br comment to the director i hate you you have ruined my life after viewing this i feel empty inside my wife and kids have left me and hate me because i couldn't speak or hardly move after seeing this i lost my job my dignity and above all my pride i will never forgive you in this life or the next which is not looking good from my newfound beliefs
<START> i am a regular reader of kathy brennan novels as such i am extremely surprised she even consulted on this show br br it is horrible by comparison to the books the brennan character is in the books a down to earth recovering alcoholic and divorced mom of a college aged daughter in she is an arrogant rhymes with rich who in typical p c fashion is not a mother the emphasis on her assisting staff complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits is totally in contrast with the books br br in total deference to the p c movement she portrays the enemies of the u s as peace lovers some of the information isn't even correct for example having a character from afghanistan as an active member of an arab american friendship group since when is an afghan an arab i'm sure if negative references were made to minorities' or women or the show's producers writers directors would have to issue an apology however in typical far left fashion all of the racial slurs go to the highest achieving minority group asians as david agent booth continually refers to angela montenegro as a br br forget that stuff and forget this show after 'the man in the episode i thought i'd try a second episode to see if it got any better it only got worse i don't even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide and i won't be watching the show ever again
<START> personally i don't like a lot of b w movies but there's something magical about this movie br br the movie starts with elizabeth lane barbara stanwyck liz writes a magazine column about how she's the of connecticut of course she's lying this becomes a problem when her publisher mr yardley asks her to play host to a navy sailor over christmas in addition mr yardley who's going to be alone for christmas invites himself up to the farm for the christmas party from there things just go crazy br br since the movie is set on a new england farm the movie has a warm holiday feeling plus the characters are hilarious mr yardley is always shouting orders and liz's friend felix is always yelling ' when things go wrong finally the movie ends the way a christmas movie should end a jolly fat man laughs and shouts what a christmas br br in short no matter what age you are you will love this movie
<START> there have been many movies on living the american dream and this is one of them br br first of all on the technical side there is a lot wrong the audio is bad i had trouble understanding the dialogs here and there and the camera positions could have been better br br they really tried to come up with a good movie but for example the part where they show how jonathan is loosing himself in the dream with girls drugs and alcohol is done very badly the acting is very poor as well from all the characters in the movie br br i had a hard time watching it from the beginning till end and couldn't wait for the movie to be over br br if your expectations are low and you're bored on a sunday with bad weather watch it if you in for a deep story with action then this is not your movie br br normally i would not have give a score of 1 but of 4 5 for this movie but the reason i gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio and camera uses not to mention the bad cut scenes with cheesy effects
<START> in checking out peter falk plays an elderly new yorker who summons his children home so that they can be with him before he plans to commit suicide as the movie progresses we get to see everyone's flaws and other problems while some people may interpret this as a heartwarming movie i mostly enjoyed it for peter falk's character not letting anything get him down and even engaging in a little lewdness now and then br br so it might not be the best movie ever but still worth seeing i've long thought that peter falk has the perfect look to play this sort of role what with his glass eye and all also starring laura san giacomo david paymer judge reinhold and falk's real life wife
<START> this movie while it could be considered an alright attempt at comedy is not what the previews made it out to be the first half is comprised of typical robin williams stand up material though he really didn't do many voices he was always great at the one liners and hitting the punchlines somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program that is used in the election here is where the net 3 comes in a woman who helped with this program wants the truth to be told and the evil corporation wants to shut her up spoilers her boyfriend even helps them though this isn't even fleshed out this movie could have been one of political brilliance perhaps with at the reigns but it falls short in a stew made by too many chefs
<START> this is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater look at the end of the picture totally theatrical br br with a reminiscent of les liaisons the final steam less speech try to make us think that the whole and deep theme of this matter was the manhood who cares by this point it was about manipulation and so the audience feels after this movie has ended br br young directors a play is told with the words more than actions a film is the opposite most of the times br br and i'm not talking about the gay theme overly exploited without a point 'cause there's no explanation of this topic considering the so called philosophic or presumptuous basis to the level that this film should have been called grand gay
<START> i watched this episode a lot of times because i didn't get how died this is what happened piper and phoebe try and save their innocent a doctor because wants to kill him phoebe goes upstairs to look in the book of shadows while and piper are protecting their innocent appears while phoebe is still upstairs so throw an energy ball at the doctor but pushes him out of the way and get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall same with piper so phoebe comes downstairs and says the spell since it was only phoebe who said it and not the power of three only got wounded calls leo to heal piper and so leo heals them phoebe went into the underworld to find cole meanwhile and piper are looking for in the streets piper and see and piper uses her power to blow up meanwhile a new reporter got it all on tape so its all over the new about the three powerful halliwell sisters meanwhile phoebe doesn't know anything because she is still in the underworld there's and people all over the halliwell house then a maniac comes in the house and says can i be part of your coven and says no this is our house get out of here and uses her powers to throw her out as the maniac come out of the house crying saying there mean witches the maniac gets so mad that she shoots piper right through the stomach get in her car and trays to go to the hospital but people won't let her through so uses her powers to move people out of the way making people wanna kill her more they got to the hospital but piper didn't make it meanwhile phoebe is in the underworld phoebe finds out that they have been exposed so phoebe asks cole to ask the source if he can reverse time the source says he will only reverse time if phoebe promises to stay here in the underworld so cole told phoebe what the source told him phoebe says what would make him think i would make a deal like that and then cole says so you can save one of your sisters lives leo goes to the hospital to find out the piper really is dead so he tells phoebe that its true then phoebe agrees to stay only if cole will go back to warn piper and about the exposer and death of piper back at the hospital swat is about the shoot but the second before they do time is rewound back when they were at the manor with the doctor but this time phoebe wasn't there to call leo to heal and piper so the doctor get throw in the wall too the doctor died and so did but this is what i didn't get if piper was throw against the wall too how come only died why did they not show leo come and heal piper and leo trying to heal if you know the answer please e mail me at yahoo com ps i miss but i like paige too and i'm glad the show continued
<START> this screened at sundance last night to a receptive if mute crowd clearly the story is worth relating it's powerful and true but did the director have to cast every single role with a recognizable face i mean really you spend have your time saying oh look it's the guy from or hey it's easy rider and you lose sight of the story perhaps it's the only way this guy could get his movie made but it's a little distracting sort of like 'the love boat or those old towering inferno movies that were o' block with stars ' i wish he's just told the story simply with less famous faces also the camera work seems kind of lazy like there wasn't any thought about where to put the camera to best tell the story all in all i thought it was okay but could have been really good
<START> the merchant of four seasons isn't what i would call a happy movie at all or even one that impressed me to the point of praising it to the sky there are other fassbinder flicks for that like veronika voss and the underrated satan's brew but it's certainly no less than a fascinating experiment in taking a look at those in a society that you and me and others we know might possibly know or not really want to know i imagine in the early 70s in germany a generation coming out of ww2 had a stigma to live with but tried their best just to get by this is a stigma that floats all over this film and in many instances in fassbinder's work in general but especially because with four seasons he takes his eye on the middle class and a particular married couple the distanced depressed angry hans the fruit seller and his long suffered wife that is nothing short than trying for realism in the guise of melodrama if cassavetes were a crazy german he might make this film maybe even as just a lark br br the story sounds simple enough where drinking gets out of control he beats his wife this scene is one of the toughest to take maybe in just any movie the way fassbinder's camera lingers without a cut as his wife is left helpless and their daughter trying to stop him in his frenzy and then she's ready to leave him as he stands in the room her family holding him back she makes the call for divorce and he gets a heart attack right there he recovers his business suddenly starts booming again with some help from some good or not so good employees and yet this only continues his longing for another woman and his despair in general br br and yet it's in this simplicity that fassbinder tries and succeeds for the most part in attaining a mood of dread of a tense vibe in a kitchen or in the bedroom or out on the street that you can cut with a knife and bleed out the weakest part of this all may be the acting at least that was my initial impression hans played by can be a stilted presence with only the slightest movements in his face and eyes and for a while it doesn't look like he's much of a good actor the actress playing his wife hermann and her sister fassbinder hanna schygulla fare better but only cause they're given more to do conventionally like cry or look concerned it takes some time to adjust to what is essentially a void in his guy hans of something from his own psychological self torment or self pity that pervades himself and those around him who just want to get on with some sense of normalcy especially once hans gets successful br br not everything clicks together in the merchant of four seasons but enough did to make me recommend it to those looking for a different slice of life than you might be used to with more modern american movies fassbinder's world here is a combat between the melodrama he loves in cinema and the harsh crushing sense of humanism that he feels personally and puts into characters that for better or worse we somehow identify with are the epps a family you know of or could you even be them who's to say it's a methodical study of tragic emptiness in the human spirit and its goals are all attained
<START> this is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever it really does not qualify for movie status it is very cheap apparently shot on videotape horribly acted and just plain rotten i could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was it looked like a home video i mean i believe a guy i know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours it is that bad i noticed the name from whence this i will never rent anything with that name on it again when you rent a flick check to see if it is from this company one thing is true though if you like horribly acted amateur movies then you might like this loser it is absolutely boring and terrible you have been warned
