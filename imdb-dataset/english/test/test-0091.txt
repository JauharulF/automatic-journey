<START> i was surprised to like this movie since i'm from the check your brain at the door and have fun school of film viewing however this film touched my heart i have friends like mentally retarded emily i have friends like and i've been in shoes chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others br br amy disappointment in her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with were raw and painful to watch and perhaps i am denser than most but i never saw the twist with father coming usually i cotton on to those things rather quickly br br my reservations are similar to others posted here i thought christopher lloyd's wonderful sympathetic character a very different role for him i thought was underused what happened to him once he realized what was going on with the poetry would he like james try again second the ending such as it was didn't seem to resolve or accomplish anything i didn't expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends tied neatly but i felt that i was left at odds with the characters that there was no real healing taking place here or any real efforts at healing being made br br otherwise exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and for some very very true
<START> look no further this is it the worst movie ever made there may be others that are tied but there are none worse there can't be br br i found this movie on a clearance sale laserdisc for 3 25 and thought no movie with those actors could possibly not be worth that price turns out it's worth triple that as the minimum they should have paid me to watch it br br i'm virtually certain that the girl in the picture on the cover of the package is not the girl in the movie they substituted someone else someone younger and cuter to make it look more appealing whatever plot there was amounted to about three minutes of actual movie the rest is filler and i don't mean the kind of filler that you only realize is filler when it's over or that is some kind of eye candy you don't mind having there i mean filler that has you thinking about your shopping list i think the music must have been made up by somebody with a friend who had a radio he listened to once it's terrible br br if there were a shot of a nice mountain a river valley a forest anything there would be something positive about this movie there isn't even with the speeder button on the remote even at top laserdisc speed you can't get it over with fast enough br br after years of thinking about commenting on movies being tempted but not registering with imdb i finally cracked because i had to do my part to push the user rating on this stinker down as far as possible br br the guidelines ask that you focus on the content and context i can't there isn't enough content to focus on and that's exactly my point sometimes bad is just bad and this movie would have to be much better than it is to aspire to being only that
<START> apparently re cut episodes from the gangbusters tv show on the big screen while this was frequently done in the 50's and 60's because people didn't have a tv or a color tv and producers wanted an increased return on their investment big screen ticket sales or if it went to the small screen of a series that isn't in syndication the results were usually less then the sum of their parts the only time i've ever seen it work were where multi part stories were put together ala rocky jones or man from uncle or in the case of horror anthology the veil and 13 demon street here the effect is to have stories of american criminals in the 20's and 30's dillinger pretty boy floyd bonnie and clyde etc inter cut with each other as a narrator talks about how the fbi hunted them down its a weird concoction that doesn't quite work because its clear that there are things here that don't belong together more than once i looked at the tv oddly because things didn't seem right in fairness i won't describe the cheapness of the production since this was what early tv and the series was like its not bad but its not very good either to be perfectly honest the episodes of the series that i've seen work better a single episodes where we're not expecting as much given the choice i'd rent dvds of the show instead of this movie
<START> i first heard about log when i was on the for the local science fiction convention craig linden banks sophie banks and brian came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making tv on a shoestring budget i have to say that i was very pleased when i finally had the chance to see the show comparisons with red dwarf are inevitable since the first seasons of red dwarf were also shot on a low budget although log has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time and thus have to make up for the lack of eye candy with good writing and acting linden banks who plays chief petty officer blather does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless persona br br original idea was for the story to be told in two minute interstitials shown in between other shows over the course of an evening although for some reason space didn't get how cool an idea this would have been and so the interstitials were all rolled up into a one hour show which space normally showed in two half hour episodes the existing dvd doesn't include episode 3 which premiered at con in seattle in 2005 or episode 4 which was previewed at in vancouver in 2006 but if you're in touch with your local fannish community you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you
<START> the first time i saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the kim possible movie the commercial showed sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing it is one of the stupidest commercials i've ever seen basically they go back and forth with lines like nothing is a thing so technically nothing is something when i saw that i figured it would be yet another lame lizzie maguire knockoff by disney but i had no idea how bad br br fast forward about 3 weeks when my sister turns on the t v naturally sadie happened to be on what i saw had to be one of the most unintentionally funny shows i've ever seen how'd it go something like this br br sadie a vegetarian tree hugger has an incredibly unhealthy obsessive crush on the very monotone and poorly acted acted out owen for some reason her friend margret decides that owen needs to be tested to see if he is as good as he seems what exactly do these tests involve well one thing they do is put a cockroach on her notebook why so that she can be squeamish and ask her monotone knight in shining armor to get it off how is this a test because if he squishes it he's mean and uncaring and doesn't believe that bugs as sadie puts it are innocent animals too they spread disease and they deserve to be squished but of course owen just brushes it out the window and sadie is still in love but that's not all margret says he needs to be challenged one more time on something that no guy can pass this one involves shoving scarves down their pants yes you read that right and walking buy him to see if he notices their large butts predictably he doesn't notice and we see sadie in her bizarre and strange notebook world sadie decides that she wants to be with owen forever raise a family with him and as she puts it live like wood ducks with their brood that's just plain wrong br br bottom line this is the strangest most insane show i've watched for those who like to make fun of dumb stuff you'll love it for anyone else skip this show
<START> black vengeance is an alternate title for ying hung ho aka tragic hero 1987 i have just seen this on vhs together with the first part of the story gong woo ching rich and famous also 1987 the poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4 dvd set of movies starring rod perry the black gestapo fred williamson black cobra 2 richard lawson black fist the fourth movie is called the black six strangely while the characters retain their original names in rich and famous in black vengeance chow yun character is named eddie shaw alex man man leung is harry and andy lau is called johnny also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films perhaps that was the year they were american dubbed according to the release dates given on imdb tragic hero was released before rich and famous was there any reason for releasing the sequel first despite some comments i enjoyed these films although they aren't among best such as the killer and hard boiled which are truly astonishing however if one day i come across a 2 dvd set of rich and famous and tragic hero i won't hesitate to buy it hopefully these comments about black vengeance clear up which was also for me a mystery as to where it belonged in chow yun filmography
<START> always enjoyed doa 1950 which starred edmond o'brien and was very curious about this film dennis quaid dexter cornell was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students dexter gets involved with meg ryan sydney fuller who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems if you like dennis quaid and love meg ryan you will enjoy viewing this film meg gave an outstanding performance and kept this picture worth watching
<START> i just saw this movie and all i can say is where are the drive in's these days this seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 maybe playing with one of those joan collins movies but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's silly plot that is full of holes but it does remind one of the era it was made in interesting to see melanie griffith so young and anne lockhart is quite attractive though not much of an actress in fact there is not much acting going on in this movie at all it's sort of a dukes of hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 dodge charger jumping over stuff in the woods but there is a comet jumping over a garbage dump in this one
<START> as much as i respect firefighters for what they do i was unimpressed and bored with this film the acting was ok but joaquin phoenix was a poor casting choice to say the least br br what bothered me the most about this film was the celtic music whining on and on and on at the worst possible time in the film the directing and continuity was pretty bad too br br spoiler for example after phoenix's character falls several stories and is badly injured he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio then miraculously he manages to crawl across a huge space covered in rubble and fire to punch a man sized opening in a double thickness brick wall using only a foot long piece of re bar and to top it all off he then gets ultra weak and busted up again br br did anyone also notice that throughout the film whenever you see shots of joaquin fighting fires and rescuing people there is little or no smoke in the buildings i would think the smoke should be pretty thick in a flame engulfed building br br i also got tired of hearing the search and rescue team yelling i need some equipment over here br br i really thought i would enjoy this film but i found it to be a weak attempt at representing the true life of a fireman the intention was there but i honestly think that this film could have been so much better i couldn't help but think that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this film and had to rush to put it in theaters more time should have been spent on editing and ensuring there was good flow to the film br br the special effects were impressive in some scenes but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others kind of like a jerry bruckheimer movie br br call me critical but i just can't see what's so great about this movie at least it wasn't as bad as the whole ten yards which is by far the worst film i've seen in recent months br br i really hope there isn't a ladder 50 in the making
<START> my girlfriend and i saw this movie when it was originally released the controversy that surrounded the original release teen nudity physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy were subjects that never touched our view of the film we were close to the same age as paul and michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions we were too young to get caught up in the simplistic at times acting and the corny at times emotional twists this movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have i still remember sitting in the movie theater with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic albiet syrupy final scenes
<START> what can one say about any wilder film other than they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them bugs them haunts them billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition he paints the good and the bad in all of us he also paints with love i can't imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a wilder film on it they will last because they are true i first saw this movie on tv in the 60s when i was a kid and i had to leave the room because i felt tears welling up in me and was embarrassed now i'm an old man and i still feel the tears welling but don't leave the room i knew these people and loved them and grew up around them billy preserved them in this film and not in a generation' way but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit
<START> this movie one of the best i've ever seen talks about it does it plunging ourselves in a taipei stained in cold colors where the rain falls incessantly a damp world it does it displaying us the story of two persons living in this world a man and a woman a coincidence or the fate links their existences but they're not able to open one to the other with words characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society concerning interpersonal relationships an that here is taken to the extreme limits all the characters exchange only a few words during the movie dialogues are nearly absent and when some words are spoken they're often weak and empty far away from describing people's real feelings so the progression of the story the revelation of character's feelings is developed brilliant idea by the musical digressions only apparently meaningless that speckle the movie the proceeding of the sentimental event and the drama of female protagonist lead us to a splendid ending heavily symbolic a movie totally different from the usual a clever realization by a great talented director ps forgive me for my bad grammar
<START> ok so it's a silly movie but i think they knew that when they made it and there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired overdone godzilla type genre borrowed a tape just because i knew someone in it but i did loan it out to a couple pals who also kinda liked it
<START> this movie has made me a rugby and coach larry fan the story's characters slipped and fell before they begin to grow as they struggled through incredibly strong conflicts those were understandable and completely believable like life there were no easy answers for the problems facing them all superb actors and an excellent script brought this true story to life i wish there were more movies like this one these days i watch almost exclusively worthwhile true stories because they are typically far more interesting than fiction additionally this one is inspirational and it teaches us to not to give up on anyone too quickly
<START> i rarely even bother to watch comedic movies or television these days they're insipid vulgar and most importantly not funny this one could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past it's worth watching and i don't believe it would be dated in any significant way classic humor is classic humor and good writing is good writing regardless of the era in which created br br i would love to see this film again it came to mind after having seen the somewhat similar summer school on television recently like that slightly newer film meatballs is funny without being cruel overly sexual or indulging in bathroom humor the key of course is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teen character maybe even a virtually life saving change and how they both grow up in the space of a summer
