<START> i was not making big assumptions on the fact that this for sure was a very very free adaptation from the work of de and i must say that this free adaptation form the book as a lot of possible good ideas and characters the problem is the way that is done without any care without any taste just a rumble of bad taste clichÃ©s everywhere the script is so fake and the characters so unreal that's makes petty seeing nice actors as and others lost themselves in a net of whatever except cinema or storytelling for my surprise the newcomers jorge and bravely stick in their performances but you can see them lost like a drifted boat without any direction and talking about direction this seems to be something totally missing on this the director everything is bad taste the frames are whatever and whenever the use of hand camera without any justified reason the light design that should build environments doesn't exist and no excuses that the all point is a dark real story the problem overall in this trying to be film is that as no taste or very very bad taste it's sad to see jorge and melting away in such fake and gratuity sex scenes painted here and there trough out the movie like closing narratives holes or used as fakes transition motives maybe carlos da silva should see the 2002 carlos carrera adaptation of the same book of and get the felling of how to build a true movie
<START> contains spoilers br br luchino visconti's film adaptation of thomas mann's novella is visually if not philosophically faithful to its source opera offers a more faithful reading of the apollonian dionysian struggles which consume the aging writer it is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made br br in the visconti version the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story never has venice looked more beautiful and alluring more decadent and effete if you've read the novella it's like having the descriptions on its pages come to life dirk bogarde gives an outstanding performance as gustav von although he has very little dialogue he conveys the bitterness aroused passion and finally pitiful yearning of through facial expressions alone the young actor who plays the beautiful object of desire was perfectly cast he too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures the character is pivotal to the story so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire visconti with his incredible eye for beauty knew exactly what he was doing and changing from a writer to a composer based on gustav and then using music especially the from the 5th symphony was another brilliant stroke although i'd read the mann story before the film music and death in venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind as will the haunting images which appear throughout the film especially that last one of dying on the beach as walks slowly into the sea br br one day this film will be released in dvd widescreen format and its visual splendors completely restored to us
<START> could it be that itv wouldn't want to release this absolute classic because it would show up their current series of mike bassett for what it is when discussing mike bassett with some work colleagues i mentioned cup as being a far superior offering and was surprised to find that i seem to be the only person in my entire office that has actually seen it this can't be right for a film that has got to be the funniest thing i have ever seen br br let's face it itv don't have the greatest recent record for producing comedy so you would think that they would jump at the chance of at least repeating something which is genuinely funny perhaps if it could be combined with a lucrative telephone competition of where we think the coach driver will go next then they might be interested br br come on itv there are still some of us out there who would like to watch original quality comedy drama do the decent thing thing repeat it then get it out on dvd
<START> labeling this film a lesbian love story is about as accurate as calling pride prejudice a straight love story there's just so much more to it than that br br yes the main character is a lesbian but her story is classic a journey from childhood to adulthood from sexual innocence into maturity from personal blindness to self discovery there is a stylistic element of camp to the film's direction but it is not a hindrance rather it serves to underscore the staged and dramatic parts of the main character's life br br those who know anna chancellor from the bbc version of pride and prejudice will certainly be amazed with her here rachael stirling is stellar as the main character nan and hawes is all wide eyed goodness as her lover kitty butler chancellor might have the stand out role that is aside from sally hawkins who plays zena butler this film is not for the faint of heart but it's not a piece of pro gay advertising either it's a real story with real comedy and drama an engaging story with compelling characters and well worth watching
<START> in the past 5 years i have rented some bad movies completely on purpose see i aspire to be a movie reviewer and as we all know there are horrible movies released every year anyway about 3 months ago i rented this one i watched it all the way through and cried profusely this is one of those movies that is so freakin bad it makes you want to puke it actually put a sick feeling in my stomach i've seen lots of bad movies mystery science theater 3000 anyone but this one takes the cake the plot was hard to follow the lighting horrible and the sounds almost inaudible if there was a negative rating on the scale here this movie would be at 11 for me this may seem odd but i highly recommend it it's something you have to see for yourself but don't say i didn't warn you i don't think this review could get any more precise so i'm done now br br
<START> my husband and i watched this last night it was wonderful for once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending it moved along very quickly and the acting was superb i adore tom wilkinson anyway he has never made a bad movie as far as i'm concerned the above description of his acting hits the nail on the head the facial expressions are incredible even the picturesque scenery is awesome we have just finished watched all of the prime suspect series and i am convinced that the british have a way of capturing the audience there is no doubt that i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a few hours of thorough entertainment
<START> there's really not a whole lot to say about this it's just really really bad the acting is bad the script is bad and the editing is probably one of the worst jobs ever it's so sloppy and choppy that it serves only to confuse the audience there's no real to plot to speak of mostly it's a really fake looking monster fish attacking europeans trying to pass themselves off as americans pass on this one
<START> i thrive on cinema but there is a limit a name isn't enough to make a movie the beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet but we remain hungry or angry till the end things are getting so confused that i admit that i did not understand the end or was there an end to this the opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed next
<START> christmas in connecticut is a gem of a christmas movie classic while lesser known than some others it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time i watch it every year br br barbara stanwyck is perfectly cast as elizabeth lane the single career girl way before it was popular stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise her nyc apartment and her friendly uncle restaurateur around the corner the single girl in the city existence she can't cook yet she writes a column for a magazine br br dennis morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero jefferson jones who wants to meet the amazing elizabeth lane after being lost at sea all he wants is to spend christmas in a real home which sets up the delightful madcap story that evolves it is fun from beginning to end we should all have an uncle felix too
<START> this show was a really good one in many ways although certainly an atypical western with the hero riding around on a motorcycle rather than a horse due to the 1914 setting very late for a western which tend usually to be set between and 1890 i remember some controversy about its cancellation at the time but didn't really watch it during its time on nbc when i came to see it and love it was a decade later when i was in the army stationed in germany and it was shown every week from the beginning on armed forces television by then margot kidder was famous as lois lane but i'll also always think of her as nichols' girlfriend in a lot of ways nichols was a lot like maverick both were much more attracted to getting rich with little effort than they were fighting it was in the little tv magazine that they distributed at the not really an authorized edition of tv guide but made to resemble it as closely as possible without getting into copyright trouble that i first learned the real story behind the cancellation i really wonder what the next season with the more violent twin would have been like if they had really made it as planned of course by the time this show was made the western era of tv had been in decline for around a decade someday i hope to be able to write that the reality era has been in decline for that long while gunsmoke and bonanza were still running they were both nearing their ends and it had been years since a new western had really caught on i think that this trend did a lot to hold nichols back and was the main reason that nbc executives doubted that it would ever find a large audience but to me a good western unlike a show set in contemporary times is somewhat timeless as are other period shows changing fashions and the like do nothing to make them look any more dated than they were supposed to be and i think that watching this show 10 years after it was produced is really what brought this point home to me also this show is an early pairing of garner and stuart margolin who is really one of the all time great sidekicks and not just in westerns
<START> the actors are so bland that it's almost impossible to tell them apart pauline kael said of this movie the actors have names but they're truly anonymous and the special effects are really bad they simulate with people hanging on cables and by recycling the trick that let fred astaire dance on the ceiling in royal wedding but none of these guys move well enough to make it look convincing br br the low point of the movie is when one of the characters an airplane tycoon is trying to convince some other giants of industry to come in with him in a moon rocket and he shows them a woody woodpecker cartoon that explains how a rocket works at a 2nd grade level and to think that robert heinlein worked on the screenplay br br the only plus is that the production design manages to communicate a sort of amazing stories sensibility and even that is done much better in the producer's george pal subsequent movie when worlds collide which has similar bad acting but is much more entertaining however pal's best sci fi movie has to be the time machine
<START> francis ford coppola's apocalypse now is not a vietnam war film do not confuse it with one it is set to the back drop of the war but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche it is also one of the most audacious films ever made produced or even conceived second to the lord of the rings trilogy to call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels br br opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the doors the end as martin sheen's captain benjamin l willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes willard's mission is to terminate with extreme prejudice colonel kurtz marlon brando who has invariably gone awol in the far reaches of the cambodian jungle and as told by his general is out there operating without any decent restraint totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct and he is still in the field commanding troops kurtz is a delusional colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god for willard this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat yet the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior br br teaming up with a small crew they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat along the way willard educates himself on all things kurtz during sheen's raspy voice over he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads kurtz was a highly decorated and respected green beret he was a normal man with a family until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that willard is being led the descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses but willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find kurtz as he reads about this mythic figure he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become we know that willard's slow decay will parallel that of br br marlon brando has been revered for decades his presence unmatchable his genius undeniable but for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance brando can be perceived in the eyes of an uncompromising film goer as a hack he is most certainly not brando was difficult to work with hard to interpret and impossible to understand but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable the man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't his colonel kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity br br if the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than francis ford coppola's actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's fanatical struggle to produce a movie it is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule coppola contemplated suicide the film was not only an undeniable struggle to make it is a grueling film to watch coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of martin sheen's haunted soldier willard br br i can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film at the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace audacity aside apocalypse now is pure film making my respect and admiration for mr coppola is of the highest order but i shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film a lack of innovation it is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart but we still have the great ones like coppola's masterpiece a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend br br that depth in apocalypse now is the step into madness the killing can disturb the loss of innocence can but it is the damage from within the countless barrages of images that distress unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual the savage and the animalistic if the thought of killing does not provide the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis
<START> michael is probably too cutesy for most action movie fans and too hollywood for the intellectual crowd but i found it both extremely funny and very touching despite it being both cutesy and formulaic br br when three skeptics are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel they end up escorting him on a grand tour of the mid western country side only to find that it is each of their own hearts that need investigation br br when taking this film apart as with most films today there isn't a lot of new material but when taken as a whole it has a refreshingly original approach and is off beat enough to entertain one all the way through br br while not being a family film it is suitable for all ages and a good film to share with the whole family or that special someone br br michael isn't a great film but it certainly is a good film a touching film and well worth seeing br br
<START> game huh game i'm not even sure the bloody hosts of that particular reality game know what the term means let alone the bloody players in the game br br an aspiring would look at that and think hmmmmm what the flying fork was that useless excuse for a demonstration of seducing women i've seen my neighbours dog seduce women with more panache than that and it is one ugly bloody dog and its main approach tactic is to frenetically hump legs br br i challenge the frustrated chump hosts of that show to a show down a demonstration of their so called pickup ability can they deliver if one is to view that piece of un reality drivel then you would realise no these mentally masturbating suck me darling boyfriend wanna be hosts of queer eye or something similar not that there's anything wrong with that are unable to un shrinkwrap their penises long enough to provide a demo of a real pickup br br as you lovely north americans say 'nuff said br br a message from down under with love
<START> what i liked best about this flick was the chance to see joan woodbury who awe struck me as one of the several beauties in the charles boyer classic algiers in a leading role she does well as rita an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss her ascent to the top reminds me of joan crawford's characters e g mildred pierce who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and willpower if you're looking for a film noir classic better look elsewhere at several points it's difficult to know where this story is going i first got the impression that it was going to encompass rita's plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son but payback time ended up being only a minor point and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the film where rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption anyway it's only 72 minutes so a second viewing should clear up any my copy is from a platinum box set called mobster movies the picture quality is good but the soundtrack sucks constantly skipping fragments of dialog there are eight films in the 5 50 box making each movie a fair 69 cents look for anne archer's father john archer as rita's childhood friend bob alan ladd doesn't get much screen time it's definitely joan picture
