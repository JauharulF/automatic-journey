<START> a nice humorous mix of music hall in the first third mostly and police procedural mystery as the various suspects' stories start to collapse the final exposure of the murder may come as a surprise if you don't watch closely a gritty look at paris of the time you can ignore the final scene the hollywood ending louis jouvet is best as the police inspector who seems to be just passing through but is really on top of things
<START> in yet another case of misleading marketing this film is included in a 10 movie dvd set called women who kick butt but even in its original cover it seems to promise shannon tweed in an action role actually during most of the movie tweed plays the typical whiny and prissy female character who has to be rescued by the male lead and even when she's trained in jungle warfare she still has to be dragged around by him there is one female rebel who is a stronger character but she's mostly kept in the margins of the movie the male lead is reb brown and he does have some unintentionally i think funny moments like when he gets electrocuted the action scenes are badly directed and poorly acted some of the stuntmen needed a few lessons on how to get shot and die convincingly i suppose if you're in the right mood you can find some things in firing line to laugh at at one point we can hear tweed speaking but her lips are not moving but mostly i was just bored
<START> the russian space station with a crew of four russians and two americans is threatening to re enter the earth's atmosphere in a matter of days russia asks for help in rescuing the stranded crew and nasa scrambles the space shuttle atlantis the nsa also have an interest in the a prototype microwave power source being tested aboard and organise for one of their men to be placed on the mission br br that's the plot onto less important things the space station and the shuttle are the same blatantly obvious models used in 'memorial day' and 'dark and a handful of other films i suspect the model effects are so obvious throughout the entire movie and make the film look very 1960s the sets are a little better but are far too '80s for what is supposedly a brand new station built by an american company which later comes in as part of a conspiracy to destroy and the and claim the insurance the script has a few good moments including farewell and the little spiel at the end but is otherwise fairly bland and sub standard the acting is okay the only real standout performance comes from alex who offers up some of the film's better dialogue michael dudikoff is surprisingly one of the best parts about this film ice t is ice t 'nuff said the film offers a few surprises though that i don't wish to spoil br br certainly one of the better low grade contemporary set sci fi films of the last six years but not the best the film is watchable but the special effects and plot will probably put a lot of viewers off rent the other sci fi film instead
<START> i rarely write reviews but this film simply demands more attention than it gets as it contains the most hysterical kidnapping gone comically wrong sequence ever filmed br br i have only seen this once and found it to be the funniest film i had ever had the privilege to watch i laughed from beginning to end it is such a shame it is not out on dvd or video br br you can only compare its cinematography with that of it's a mad mad mad mad world or promise her anything only this storyline isn't nearly as complex as mad world br br i hope in the near future this film is released as it would be a shame to lose such a comedy gem amongst the dregs we have nowadays
<START> i happened to catch about the last 45 minutes of the movie late night about 8 years ago what a wild and funny 45 minutes i was absolutely knocked out by chase shoot out at the end that takes place at night inside an old hotel that's being torn down with a wrecking ball incredible i vaguely remember stacy keach stealing a cop car faking being a cop and strong arming some winos wino to keach hey why ya us keach it's my job you're correct they don't make them like that anymore great movie the hopefully it will see the light of day as a dvd along with other lost treasures hickey and being one such
<START> this movie was not only disappointing to the horror suspense film lover it was disappointing to anyone who sees it wow i thought that this film might be funny because the guy with the huge head however it was filled with long and drawn out conversation that wasn't needed there was so much sex that i hate women and men now this film was not only boring but there was no substance wow wow on to of all this each scene looks like it was light from a single light bulb and i think they used the same set for two different lawyers a restaurant and an airport this movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies because in the end it feels likes wasted time see the movie br br party
<START> this show is awesome and we have been enjoying it thoroughly set in alaska i don't agree with the homosexual content on tonight's show i feel that you are pushing too hard to bring new york to alaska its one thing to have a new yorker struggling in the alaska wild but to try to turn the alaska town into new york this is a nice show about dainty women and true alaska men and to bring a same sex couple into the mix is throwing the balance way off alaska should be portrayed as a man and new york as the woman i think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you all are doing can't we have a nice show without the imbalance of nature
<START> i saw roger moore huffing it on the scenes that required running or exercise he was a james bond who would be most comfortable sitting at a bar telling stories with his fellow british knights nothing against the elderly in age appropriate roles but how realistic is it for a frail looking 58 year old man to be fighting on the wings of planes hanging off the side of a train swimming in a swamp with crocodiles etc aside from the fact that octopussy was incredibly silly vapid and moronic the fact that a frail oldster engaged in many death defying stunts just made it so much easier to laugh at james bond by 1983 roger moore was clearly looking his age and he was long past the time when he looked like he could fight with younger men i saw this movie in the theater and the howls of laughter were many and very often any credibility that james bond had built up was gone after octopussy br br the only thing missing from octopussy was benny hill and his supporting cast another low point was that the incredibly lame louis jordan was one half of the axis of evil jordan helped to make the whole concept even more laughable and the russian general was a total goof octopussy works better as a comedy spoof similar to spies like us br br even the fight scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes done in many other films by better actors take emperor of the north 1972 where lee marvin ernest borgnine fought all over the top bottom of the train and made it look exciting and real br br roger moore had a thin frail body in 1983 and yet his stunt double was clearly a younger taller athletic muscular man even the hair color did not match this only made his fight scenes more comedic the moore stunts looked like those old low budget chop socky kung fu movies especially with the bad editing the director seemed to try to make the bad acting and bad stunts better by providing several views of the same stunt this only accentuated the differences between moore and his stunt double the fact that the train scenes with moore were shot inside a studio could be noticed from the lighting when moore was in the shot versus the exterior shots of the stunt double on a real train though many of the bond movies have to be the worst ever when it comes to editing their stunt fights you can usually clearly see that the bond actor is not actually fighting overall octopussy has to rank as one of the worst movies ever made and easily the worst of the worst bond movies
<START> in tolstoy wrote this in his diary the political is not compatible with the artistic because the former in order to prove has to be one sided this thought from a great mind is applicable to usa the movie the film might be read by those with a narrow focus as a 90 minute slam of bush cheney et al as well as a ripping of america as an out of control force that will ultimately be destroyed by its own folly and thirst for power the more open minded viewer will take note of the recurring images and themes that make this dvd a testament to thought as the main character breaks up into bits and pieces surrounded by recurring visuals of the natural world contrasted with the man made constructions towers roads video monitors radio vehicles above all the ominous threat of wars that have been and are to come smolder throughout war and rumors of war are what is created destroyed and recreated on the screen in our conscious world and in our unconscious minds
<START> ladies and gentlemen we've really got ourselves a winner here actually we don't but boy is this film an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible hoot of a stinker poor alma fetching julia ruiz is suffering from an ancient mayan curse that causes lethal poisonous snakes to grow inside of her body alma and her deranged shaman husband brujo castro who feverishly overacts with delicious eye rolling intensity stowaway on a train that's bound for los angeles naturally a bunch of deadly vipers get lose so they can terrorize the motley assortment of passengers the brothers working from an absurd script by eric treat the ridiculous premise straight thereby creating a wonderfully wretched piece of deliriously campy cheese the cruddy cgi effects the pathetically common variety gardner snakes there's would be scary rattlesnake noises added to the soundtrack to imbue them with a faint sense of otherwise nonexistent menace the plodding pace the total dearth of any tension or momentum the obvious rickety stage bound train set and especially the simply astonishing you gotta be kiddin' me over the top preposterous ending are all downright awesome in their very jaw dropping awfulness better still we also got game if lame acting from a no name cast a nice smidgen of tasty gratuitous female nudity a funky score and plenty of extremely gross and grotesque make up f x bonus points for the fact that the token irritatingly cutesy little girl gets eaten by a large reptile and for the stoner engineer who gets caught smoking crack out of a hollow light bulb an absolute gut buster of a kitsch howler
<START> i love this movie because every single element of it is nothing less than excellent i will quickly praise a few of them peter o'toole gives us one of his great performances as he becomes the definitive mr chips clark has a beautiful voice and is perfect as katharine the director was able to bring the story to the screen in a fresh new way combine that with the fantastic and creative cinematography editing writing etc and you have a film that shows the fine quality of its production i can't praise the well planned camera work enough it moves us up and around zooming in and out giving us the best views of and letting the locations become part of the scene clark's last song 'you and i' is just 3 beautifully composed long takes and in this era of 2 second takes i can appreciate the extra care that everyone involved had to give to get those long scenes perfect the music is great and the songs move the story along just as they should leslie is one of my favorite composers listen to these songs how could anyone not like them this is a very romantic story between two people nearing middle age that find each other bring out the best in each other and it lasts till the end of their lives excellent production values acting camera work and music make this movie well worth watching
<START> it is a wonderful film about people strange people the characters in the movie all have a very tragic past so they all have their problems their problems evolve in a way that makes the plot of the movie very absurd but that does not make the movie worse only better for it is shot in a kind of fantasy like way so nothing is real this review might sound a little weird but then again the movie is not quite normal it is also a hilarious movie at many times if you have not seen it see it enjoy
<START> my 2nd favorite film of 1970 after five easy pieces was totally dismissed by a lot of idiots calling in an audience baiting piece of trash peter boyle a well known liberal is incredible as the hard assed working stiff who has a few problems with the younger generation he's a frightening dude but has a great imagination and is very funny i was a teenage liberal when this was released but as horrifying as joe seemed to me he also cracked me up susan sarandon in her first role is perfect and a mixed up stone rich fox the dinner scene in queens is hilarious and insightful for everybody involved br br this was not an exploitation film and the script which was oscar nominated should have won that year the director just didn't waste enough money making it to give it enough credibility in hollywood no matter your political then and now you'll like somebody in this film a definite 9 out of 10 it's on dvd and video check it out
<START> right where do i start i cannot even imagine to comprehend this preteen pathetic excuse of a show picture this a boarding school where kids whose parents are rolling in money simply chuck them in there so as to jet around the world themselves it could not get any more diabolic than this br br if you taught these kids shall not even upgrade them to the term teenagers because they hardly even act like sane were self centered think again about 23 minutes choked full of their so called problems boy troubles and the like br br the heroine of the show of course zoey played by britney's polly pocket little miss i'm all that sister jamie lynn spears has obviously much to learn about acting however i will give her some face because her superficial one dimensional character does not allow much room for depth she plays pacific coast academy's sun moon and stars crusader fighting for the plight of all women equality of all genders br br perfect in everyway always with her two loyal sidekicks nicole the daffy bimbo who obviously has too much of daddy's cash and tough chick dana who proves a hard nut to crack both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively not that i blame that but horror of horrors in comes lola who deems herself the greatest actress since natalie wood with green feathers in her hair and fake tan she is even more rude than zoey herself if that is even possible and even more dumber than nicole and hell we know that cannot be possible br br this show like all the sorry excuses for television programmes nickelodeon has been spewing out since 2000s is a prime victim of stereotyping get girl next door and dense to her best friend's feelings for her zoey a great albeit inarticulate at times best boy friend chase a cool arrogant ladies man logan a boy and clothes crazy girl who is not very bright nicole the one whom everyone thinks is weird just because she is extremely smart the nerd quinn the over dramatic annoying yet super thin malibu picture perfect model lola and the tough yet soft inside woman dana now where have i heard these characters before i am sorry but what is so wrong with having a personality just because quinn is passionate about science and actually cares about her future and doing well in the academic aspect in which the rest should be concerned about as well she is weird and a nerd lola at the beginning of the series proved to be a potential great character with her sassy ways and different outlook in life zoey just had to go get out your pitchforks burn her at the stake she's going back to weird town and all that jazz so much for womens rights unfortunately lola just became nothing more of another oc clone in all its anorexic glory probably so as to not outshine her mistress br br but hey the 2000 generation of myspace whores seem to love it with the chase zoey typical fairytale romance the tension between adamant hot logan and kick ass zoey or dana whichever to your liking and the pretty people please this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism they prefer a pretentious shallow and vapid lifestyle sorry to break it to you darlings that will not happen unless you have a major trust fund and parents to cushion you
<START> this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and i stopped caring this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports br br sounds promising br br not really br br i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film basically i started not watching which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up br br it may work for you it didn't for me
