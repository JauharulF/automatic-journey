<START> this is one of a very few movies with terrific acting wonderful story line and worthwhile to watch it is about changes in life it is about how happiness can be found when one is true to oneself it is about accepting oneself and others it is about life challenges it is about coming to term with reality it is about courage it is about love both actresses are very true to their role the actresses had very good chemistry between one another in the movie this is the key of the movie that made the movie it is rare to see an independent film like this one one could tell the hard work that the film crew had to have while producing this movie i wish to see more movie from this producer writer see the movie you will love it
<START> if you have never heard of jane austen seen the original movie or the 1995 bbc adaptation or even seen a pop up version of the book then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable br br from the opening scene this film must be remembered for its awful acting abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of jane austen br br whoever decided to cast actors with the exception of the excellent judi dench who have obviously never heard of jane austen let alone read her should be punished keira knightley grimaces and grins through every scene and came across as being so obnoxious that no one would want to marry her darcy looked as if he was trying to remember his lines throughout the whole film and the rest of the bennet girls were interchangeable in their lack of portraying their characters as they were originally written br br this version failed to show the proper pride and prejudice that both darcy and elizabeth suffered from and at the end of the longest two hours of my life who cared whether they got together or not absolutely abysmal even the too few minutes of judi dench cannot save this rubbish i cannot think of anything good to say about this film apart from that it eventually ended
<START> this might very well be the worst movie i've seen in my life normally i don't watch movies like this however i was forced to watch this at school what a torment br br the story is as average and boring as it can be boy meets girl at the spanish coast boy and girl fall in love but the love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is against their love at the end of the movie the film becomes some kind of weird kung fu movie were the guys in white fight the guys in black awful br br the action is so bad that it makes you laugh the dances in the film that i think are supposed to be cool are so simple and laughable that even i can do them and georgina verbaan is possibly the most irritating person i've ever seen on screen br br johan is on his way of becoming the dutch ed wood his movies are so bad that they make you laugh br br victor however gives a surprising good performance and also acts ok br br so please for your own sake don't watch this movie however if you like watching soaps this might be very well worth your time br br yuk br br 2 10
<START> i was given the solo summertime in 5th grade for our spring choral concert from that time on a great appreciation for gershwin's music arose in me i love the haunting melodies of this opera by gershwin back when i was in 5th grade around age 10 i got the lp to practice with and also love the soundtrack very much i recommend seeing this movie and if you can get the soundtrack get it you can sometimes find it on ebay an old used lp i have been searching and searching to try to find the soundtrack on cd the songs on this have marvelous musical arrangements and i truly wish it would be put on cd for purchase and also wish they would restore the movie and put it on dvd this is truly a great work that i think present and future generations would enjoy and benefit from some may think the movie slow and dull but i find it quite the contrary although poitier and dandridge have dubbed musical voices i think the voices fit the faces and personalities well a person's speaking voice and singing voice may be quite different and bess and the songs in this opera will always have a special meaning for me
<START> okay when it comes to plots this film is far from believable and also a bit silly yet despite its many deficiencies the film manages to work provided you turn off your brain and just let yourself enjoy the zaniness of it all if you can't then you probably won't like this film very much at all br br in one of the oddest plots of the 1930s robert montgomery plays a guy living near the arctic circle at a wireless station how exactly he came to such a remote outpost is uncertain but into this very very lonely and isolated existence come a steady string of guests even though it had been years since he'd seen anyone but eskimos br br first reginald owen and myrna loy arrive when their plane crashes they are supposedly on their way to montreal how they got that far off course is beyond belief reginald is a stuffy and dull fellow who is really worried about montgomery since robert hasn't seen a woman in a very long time and owen seems in constant dread that montgomery is out to steal loy for himself as for montgomery that's exactly what his plans are for the longest time you never really understand why loy is engaged to owen since he is about as appealing as soggy bread br br soon loy and montgomery fall in love but this is all for naught when out of the blue again montgomery's old fiancÃ©e arrives to announce she's there to marry him considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him montgomery naturally assumed the relationship was over but the chipper and annoying fiancÃ©e's sudden arrival is enough to destroy the plans loy and montgomery were making br br how all this is resolved is something you can just see for yourself as for the film that the plot is very silly and contrived i can't defend this but it also is pretty funny and charming and i see this film as a kooky comedy that is just a step or two below contemporary films like bringing up baby silly slight but also very charming it's worth seeing despite not being especially believable
<START> this was an awesome movie with flight scenes that were incredibly realistic i have seen it multiple times and it has kept my attention throughout every time i myself am a big fan of the air force and love to watch any movie where i can get a glimpse of an f 16 flying if you like top gun then i guarantee you will love this movie also except for a few mild curse words this is an excellent movie for the whole family it has a great plot and does not have a dull moment throughout the entire movie every second is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next so once again i highly recommend this movie
<START> once again seeing this kind of movies turns me more and more into english humor not too often seen on screen since the days of monty python and man about the house too bad br br brenda blethyn who i first saw in saving grace early in the year another must see by the way just excels as alfred molina does the rest of the cast while virtually unknown to me turns on great performances too the film starts slowly and gradually gains in pace and amusement midway i had tears in my eyes from laughing br br all in all a funny english movie a thousand times better than the supposedly 'funny' garbage that comes from hollywood br br
<START> john parrish is an ex union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the over at anchor the trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to bully parrish and his workers he has a change of heart particularly when things take a brutal turn for the worse br br originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration chiefly because of the cast that was involved when you got edward g robinson glenn ford and barbara stanwyck in the same movie you hope that they get a story and script from which to excel sadly they don't get chance to produce a western classic worthy of multiple revisits or is that my over expectation is doing it a disservice well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture i think yes it's fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from it is when all is said and done a plot that has been milked for all it's worth and then some but the violent men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production br br glenn ford as parrish is as cool as an nose throughout and it's always great to see babs stanwyck playing a bitch because she's good at it while eddie g when one gets used to him being in a western is fine in what is an under written part robinson who stepped in at the last minute when first choice as lee broderick crawford got injured is the one who is short changed the most by the makers even supporting characters such as the devilish wade matlock a grinning delight from the reliable richard jaeckel and judith a radiant dianne foster get something to leave an impression with but for what it is robinson's crutch toting bad guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasons br br not shy on action and gun play it's with the twists and almost shakespearean tragedies that rudolph film rises above the mundane with all of it gorgeously framed by burnett stunning cinematography lone pine in alabama has been used on many a western picture see seven men from now for another glorious use of it but here really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn the violent men isn't a great western picture and perhaps a better director than could have really given donald hamilton's the big country novel an adaptation to be proud of but for every and irk i personally had with it i found two more reasons to actually really like it so that it be it's recommended for sure 7 10
<START> populist approach manifests itself in all his titles from the worst to the best he doesn't care or has no clue about art all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies the problem is the effort is way too evident and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration into them the effort fails badly br br on this turkish movie who knows where the original or originals were made since it felt extremely hollywoodish to me altioklar is trying to be some sort of tarantino mr tarantino if you're reading this please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life he doesn't use subtle moves to do that all he does is to use extreme stuff and it gets unbearably absurd and laughable br br as the forensic guy with the cow licked hair is just hilarious i'm hoping to meet him in person and ask how he felt about this movie himself because i really found the role insulting for him groping her genitalia was also uncalled for and did nothing other than making everything look fake another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100 faulty pace setting when things need to be taken slowly scenes flow abruptly and at other times it makes you sleepy to watch the slow ridicule going on br br if altioklar is so deeply in love with lame hollywood superficiality he should use michael as his name instead even such a move wouldn't be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie he should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he'll never approach then realize he's not in hollywood and then take private lessons from or on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot this useless movie couldn't be saved even by those but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these steps br br by the way i've seen some infamous failures such as propaganda and and i still can't divert from saying this one was the worst turkish movie ever
<START> you can find an anti war statement here without looking too hard that layer is hackneyed or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war stripped of judgement that layer is completely uninteresting br br or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of duvall's one liners but that's just a coating for commercial br br you can try to view this as a 'realistic' vietnam war film but ask any veteran and he'll swat down that notion most vets will say it stinks br br or view it as a 'will he or won't morality play nothing rich there either br br where i found the value was in the superb self reference coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions the war to fit the greatness of the skilled multi dimensional actor playing 'a great man' br br brando the man was as much of a maverick as the kurtz character the studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method' yet he always excelled and won accolades the are uncomfortable with in spite of his strategic genius br br so coppola makes a movie all about brando's greatness to hammer on the point he places himself in the movie as hopper a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras to spout his praises brando himself is only seen in half light and silhouettes brilliant cinematography by storaro that only increases the actor's power and he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation oh yes the horror br br other pieces of interest the great use of point of view camera perspectives including 'being in the long before private ryan the ground breaking use of sound notably the ominous sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip br br don't get caught in the outer layers the rich part you should from this is the brilliant core of sound vision and self reference
<START> as one of the victims of the whole enron scandal my mother forced me to watch this movie with her how many times can i say awful the script was so weak using cliche after cliche it seems as though the writers pieced this story together with a few articles on enron watching the movie we honestly were able to complete about half of the one dimensional characters' lines and thoughts i realize this was supposedly adapted from a book but was the book this bad i don't know what to say just terrible the best thing about the movie shannon elizabeth actually kept her clothes on other than that this movie gets a big fat f
<START> some famous stories are prone to being moved to another epoch and as such becoming an embarrassing tv movie oscar wilde's ghost is one of them this tv movie for kids is utterly cheap concerning acting character work credibility directing and even concerning the modest special effects as often the question arises what was this made for
<START> may be i don't get it right i mean the movie it does not make me happy or whatever has to do maybe because of my mood anyhow this one is a simple family movie with kids for actors just admit that all movies of that kind cannot pass the barrier of 4 out of 10 never mind who is playing in the movie example antonio banderas was playing in that kind of movies two or three of them cant remember the exact count i got bored i almost fall asleep just because the topic is so clichÃ© and the actor play was so predictable but i am sure that my kid will love this movie when he grows up hey im not a monster i found some hilarious or good moments in the movie the owls in the movie were sooooo cute the trick with the painted police car windows and the hits that the kid received in the head by a golf ball
<START> i saw the film many times and every time i am more and more disappointed which is shame because the films from ex yu are usually very good the shame here is that tried to make film about the place and people it has no idea my self coming from the balkans macedonia found this film disappointing simply that the bosnian characters are not really understood and not truly portrayed to understand the mentality of a person from ex yu you need to know their background way of live what makes them cry and laugh and the director of the film didn't took that as guideline when we ex yu make films lots of symbolism is build in it which makes the characters recognisable and likable and mostly portraying the truth if it is based on true story the films like village pretty flame tito and me' no mans land' before the rain black cat white cat otac na sluzbenom putu when father was away on business ko to tamo peva who sings over there rare the masterpiece of the balkan cinematography and nothing can compare to it not the half baked story of and studio as somebody from the panel mentioned the story jumps from one end of town to the other with no real connection i am sorry but when the film is made is not only for the american armchair variety of viewers but for the rest of the world too and some of them live on the balkans and sarajevo too and to add insult to the injury half of the things are shoot in macedonia where i come from my shock when i saw the broad st of in the opening scene of the film when the bride is shoot from the sniper and what was that inserting real footage of the news covering in the film anyway very disappointing as the truth is far away from the film shame that nobody consulted the real people how is to live in sarajevo under fire before they shoot the film book is one thing and real life is other and this film lets down both
<START> awful awful awful times a hundred still doesn't begin to describe how crappy biggest loser is picture this take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say humiliate them and let them work to lose weight all on prime time television am i the only one who thinks that this isn't something people with iqs in the 3 digit area want to watch everything drags on forever with the lumps of lard whining on about how losing weight is going to mean so much for them and their lives does anyone care do they think we care do they care if we care probably not i think i'll videotape myself doing crunches and sell it to some major television corporation if this passes for television then so can my workouts
