<START> what can be said about a movie that makes two hours seem like three weeks the hero starts out in japan goes through an identity crisis saving a shinobi makes a voyage to america saving a slave named sam engages in a little wild west action saving a french japanese native american named julie goes hunting pirate's gold and then heads back to japan to fight a war the film obviously has no clue where it's going at any point in time i think the director modeled each scene after the last movie he'd watched if you're going to watch this film i suggest renting the subtitled so you and your peers can openly discuss how dumb the movie is without speaking over the movie potentially missing another dumb plot twist br br movies the director was watching during the making of this movie an american tail goes west star wars indiana jones the goonies teenage mutant ninja turtles kung fu vampire hunter d the ten commandments br br notes of interests most fear inspiring line of all time about 90 minutes or 19 days into the movie the lead character has just bested an american villain and just as one heads to the vcr to end the pain the hero proclaims let's go back to japan and the agony continues for another week
<START> my only regret is that one cannot grade a movie on imdb with a 0 a cena would definitely deserve that at least br br spoiler the movie starts with a bunch of people entering a crypt to awaken an ancient vampire when a guy cuts himself and his blood drips and falls onto the putrid and dried corpse that is supposed to be a bloodsucker the metamorphosis takes place and the vampire in an animation like effect would you believe it quickly takes on a more human form only to reveal that he's wearing a tux and a bow tie a bow tie yes red if my memory serves me right i tried to check out random scenes by skipping through a bit but it did not get any better than the opening sequences that's the point when i turned the movie off cursing it for having made me hope to see a vampire movie this is surely not one unless you're 5 and could take such stupidity seriously br br so if you like vampires and don't want to feel revolted or even disgusted learn from my mistake and don't even try to see this garbage
<START> i recently rented this promising mini series i didn't even know they had adapted it for television i was really looking forward to it since the book icon is one of the best spy thrillers i have ever read what a disappointment it was the plot only loosely resembles the one in the book the characters are completely miscast and there's some appalling acting a shame really the story behind icon is perfect for the silver screen but i think television budgets just aren't big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book br br forsyth deserves much much better than this avoid and stick to the book which is a must read
<START> i guess that after leonard nimoy had been successful in directing the search for spock and the voyage home william shatner thought he could direct too although he is a competent actor he shows here that he's just not a good director br br actually this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of trekkies who say that william shatner being an arrogant egomaniac for although his character captain james kirk was always arguably the most important role in the original star trek it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie the two other most important characters captain spock and doctor leonard mccoy are just there to support him and the other characters are just there to add comic relief br br the plot is that some emotional vulcan outcast named is with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever grateful they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a human klingon and diplomat is taking place this lures the still being constructed enterprise there since none of starfleet's other ships have experienced commanders honestly with how starfleet is run the klingons and romulans should have conquered them years ago adds the crew save spock who is revealed to be secret brothers with mccoy and kirk orders that the enterprise take off to the center of the universe to meet god who apparently every race has a word for however it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the enterprise and kirk asks what does god need with a starship the entity is destroyed but not before realizing he's been lied to for years sacrifices his life and earns spock's respect in death after the enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably as well br br ok science fiction movies are not known for realism but at some point rationality must be enforced why do people follow just for releasing their pain why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event i've certainly led a trauma free life why doesn't kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join what was the point of sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway br br so the plot's weak another problem is that though played well by lawrence is poorly portrayed just because he's an emotional vulcan doesn't mean he should act exactly like a human religious fanatic shatner who was a co writer as well as the director could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional vulcan i guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us gee i guess that means that klingons should say isn't and don't more often than is not and do not and the shouldn't prolong their sentences because they like to talk yeah i know it's sad that i know this please every st race uses unique dialog why is the exception br br the only thing to not complain about is the acting i've always known star trek to have great actors and this movie is not exception cudos also go to leonard nimoy for it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate spock in his old age br br some other things i didn't like br br shatner and the late deforrest kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing row row row your boat in this movie i guess shatner wished to silence his detractors of his singing ability what he did was prove their point br br uhura does a fan dance while wearing nothing but tree bark to draw some men into a booby trap after all the dreams of all us men are filled with images of middle aged plump women dancing naked br br comedy's all well and good as long as it doesn't affect the nature of star trek too much but when scotty bumps into an object on the enterprise and kos himself it's kinda goin' overboard br br kirk is the only crew member who can reject offer of releasing their inner pain and see through the god imposter's deception not even spock can manage either of these perhaps this scenes were from shatner to his character as many suspect br br the concept of an entity posing as god had been used in star trek before this movie more than once be creative shatner br br speaking of i didn't care for the ripping off of the music of star trek the next generation br br all in all pretty bad trek movie if you're a trekkie watch it once because it's star trek otherwise watch star trek ii the wrath of khan it's way better
<START> i like this movie above all others it is multi layered there is so much to see and appreciate every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story line the plot and the characters acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it i love the interaction between the players the subtle relationships the period atmosphere ralph fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by colin firth the scene in the sand storm where catherine el are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high lights of the film and where the affair really starts the other relationship between hanna el is yet another layer of the movie which is totally enchanting and heart rending a worthy winner of so many awards
<START> i'm not going to tell anyone what happens in the end but it did not fit with the movie the rest of imaginary heroes though portrayed a realistic family going through realistic issues such as death drugs relationships and high school i could have sworn that they were my own family no joke br br emile hirsch was completely believable as a teen struggling with his brother's suicide and sigourney weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her slightly dysfunctional family together br br although this family may take their issues to the extreme anyone can relate to what they go through whether it be graduation living up to expectations or being a parent
<START> and kept falling asleep if you want to see miles o'keefe around in a furry speedo by all means rent this movie if not please don't bother rife with anachronisms was this supposed to be set in the ice age the iron age the steel age or the age of reason what was the reason for the black wig on the guy dressed up as genghis khan was that really supposed to be genghis khan if ator had access to so much advanced technology and science why did we have wait another 1000 years for leonardo it's never clear where ator comes from or if he's supposed to be some superior sort of being you wonder if it was all explained in the first movie but after seeing this one you know you'll never bother
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen not only that it is a comedy which isn't funny but it's also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects br br the two heroes with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot that they touched each others genitals all the time but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the heroes which finds its climax in showing how and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their joyful lifestyle but i hadn't expect anything better by director michael bully who also made two not funny tv shows a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sf comedy movie but and stefan had been just a little better in some of their stand up programs for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra who is very beautiful to me
<START> this is a great film for pure entertainment nothing more and nothing less it's enjoyable and a vaguely feel good movie br br a minor but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we don't know why justine and broke up okay most first relationships don't work for one reason or another but they more or less seemed like a nice couple br br in a nutshell it's worth a watch to escape reality
<START> technically abominable with audible pops between scenes and awesomely amateurish flesh requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers but the dialogue rings amazingly true and joe who exposes his body in almost every scene also gives an utterly convincing performance a curio to be sure but the more polished trash made two years later is a definite step forward i suggest you watch that instead 1 2
<START> i loved this film markie post is really great in it i saw it on lifetime and it's in the same entertaining class as films like 'the betty broderick story' up a mother's rage' etc which by the way are also very good entertaining films it's an over the top drama about a single mother who tries to break away from her middle class predictable personality this movie is just pure entertainment it doesn't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction but it does show how any regular middle class person can they do get addicted to heroin junkies aren't just homeless uneducated people on the street by the way if you do watch it check out how the kid bosses his mother around spoiled 8 out of 10 stars
<START> this movie is amazing it is funny sexy violent and sick but it all holds together for a brilliant troma rendition of romeo and juliet if you don't mind being grossed out a bit ok a lot but it's funny grossed out see this movie it's worth it there's not one level on which it doesn't deliver i've seen it thrice now and it is still amazing i recommend it go get it
<START> quite simply i was tickled pink watching this in the movie theatre and grinned from ear to ear eyes wide open whilst trying to take all the details in that are at the same time insanely simple fresh yet incredibly sophisticated breathtaking and in imaginative br br in terms of audience age range it is probably pre totoro the plot works because of the pure heart of 5 years olds who are focused in what they want and conscientious in their pursuit they lives in a world that is by cynicism and cultural learning of how everything is to work while most critics might disregard this film due to the lack of a 'message' or 'plot' film although it is in there somewhere it is precisely for this reason the film should be cherished too often our judgement are impeded by our own limitations of cinematic and cultural standing like most of film each is totally unique but undeniably may at times feel so unique and fresh it may feel alien like br br the viewing experience provide a wonderful change from all the generic children's products that are generally to please the adult demographics ie animals that talks like their human counterparts eddie murphy in shrek it is perhaps comforting to know that good old fashioned hand drawn cells still work so incredibly well in this digital era where shrek cars generally triumph it therefore feeling rather nostalgic at the same time makes the film feels timeless a bit like how totoro and jungle book hasn't really aged br br the subtleties of each character's expression and body language is captured in such nuanced interpretation that digital films like wall e can never compete on or if it does it would be a very expensive process it would be a big pity for wall e to win over this one at the oscars and it probably will this year yet it might be quite unfair to compare the 2 mediums as it is really the craftsmanship and the story telling that wins at the end of the day for this is a true master of
<START> a ridiculous movie a terrible editing job worst screenplay ridiculous acting a story that is completely br br if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done judging by this one the entire world movie industry would now be dead br br a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who think they can make movies br br i am still wondering who are those two girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to us br br
<START> this is the kind of movie that i grew up on it is great family fun that the kids love and the parents enjoy as well i wish more films like this were made it's a great story about a little boy who raises a bull with his mother and sister and shows it all the way up to the national grand championship where he wins then he's scared that someone's going to barbecue his bull so he kidnaps it and heads home with it i was really excited when i first saw this film in the theater and was surprised to see george strait julia roberts and bruce willis in this little film the music was great with all kinds of huge country names like willie nelson and the dixie chicks anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie doesn't have any children or never was a kid them self
