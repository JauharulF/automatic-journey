<START> not one of better not trying to be amusing here either chan entries the shanghai cobra has a lot going for it but in the end is just way too confusing and cluttered to be overly satisfying the film opens with a murderer named the shanghai cobra having already struck twice and now is about in a scene at a diner in some way we have a guy a girl and another guy having some implied connection when one guy dies in the streets yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation i haven't even gone into the diner cook who has some involvement and a juke box that talks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't seem to have a problem with that all this is in the first five minutes or so then chan enters film working for the government and flying out to help a friend he also has right to check a bank's store of radium and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages that he helped arrest in shanghai many years earlier i found the plot very involved as stated earlier toler is back as chan he is ever affable benson fong and mantan moreland are back too both do good jobs and are quite amusing but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance this isn't a bad movie not just a very interesting one except for the most devoted of chan fans
<START> the detonator is set in bucharest where some sort of ex cia government agent named griffith wesley snipes has tracked down a arms dealer named matthew leitch things go wrong though finds out that is working for the us government after a big shoot out most of men have been killed by which the local romanian police force are unhappy about top man flint michael brandon decides to send back to the us at the same time protect a woman named nadia silvia who is also being sent back to the us however it turns out that nadia is wanted by his football club owning boss tim dutton who need her in order to complete a deal for a nerve gas bomb which they intend to set off in washington killing millions of people br br this american romanian co production was directed by po chih leong the detonator confirms beyond any shadow of a doubt that snipes has joined the washed up action film stars club who are relegated to making generic action films in eastern european locations yep snipes has joined such luminaries as jean claude van damme steven seagal dolph lundgren rutger hauer chuck norris i give snipes a bit of credit since he held on a little longer than the rest with the excellent blade trinity 2004 still fresh in a lot of cinema goers minds every film he has made since has gone straight to dvd but it had to happen sooner or later like a lot of the names i've mentioned snipes has lived off the reputation of a few great films if you look at his career he's been in more bad films that good ones like the recent films of seagal the detonator is pretty awful the script by martin wheeler is as predictable boring by the numbers as anything out there the detonator is the sort of film you expect to see on an obscure cable tv channel playing at 2 o'clock in the morning the detonator is chock full of clichÃ©s snipes is forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman at first they dislike each other but by the end they are in love his closest friend at the cia turns out to be a traitor while the obnoxious by the book boss no one likes actually turns out to be a pretty decent guy snipes character is allowed to run around bucharest shooting killing blowing people up like it doesn't matter he never gets arrested the action is dull forgettable the bad guy own a football club so there are lots of annoying football terminology there aren't even any funny one liners br br director leong doesn't do anything anything to liven things up the detonator looks cheap with a car chase in which the two cars never seem to get over the mark ok the action scenes are relatively well staged but they are few far between utterly forgettable in a 'bad guy shoots at snipes misses in return snipes shoots at bad guy kills him' sort of way there's a half decent car crash explosion but very little else it seems some of the detonator was shot in a romanian football stadium i think i'd rather have watched the game for 90 minutes rather than this film br br with a supposed budget of about 15 000 000 the detonator is reasonably well made but not that much really happens set filmed in bucharest in romania the acting isn't that great snipes just doesn't seem interested feels like he is just there for the money which i don't blame him for at all br br the detonator is yet another poor clichÃ©d action film starring a has been actor set in eastern europe why do sony keep making these things not recommend there are much better action fare out there
<START> target is the story of a special agent who after carrying out orders to assassinate turkish terrorists note that this is one of those american movies for guys who love mindless nationalistic super patriotic crap movies returns home to find that his ex wife and two kids are taking hostage charlie snow has just a couple of hours to do whatever the terrorists tell him in order to get them back br br this was by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen and had it not been for someone i know actually and probably mistakenly taking it out of the video store i would never have watched this giant pile of garbage to begin with br br the movie plays out like any generic action movie story i have ever seen before in fact these are the kind of things they spoof on variety shows that is how bad it is i half expected in living the color's the to mad tv's will doing his steven segal impression to bust out on the screen half way through to remind you that this was just an exaggerated action movie but now our characters are here to spoof how ridiculous it really is there were not even any good fighting or action sequences by the way things are played out you wouldn't even think that anyone was kidnapped that there were any terrorists or that anything remotely interesting was going on br br not only is the story completely and utterly uninteresting the acting is so terribly wooden just watch the part where stephen baldwin as former special agent charlie snow is talking to the kidnappers on the telephone they tell him that they have his wife and they put her on the phone she says charlie help or something to that effect and baldwin replies it's okay honey in such a deadpan manner you think he was reading the script and trying to sound out the words phonetically i imagine that despite being such a ridiculously bad movie one that belongs on the bottom 100 on imdb a list that they should expand to at least 250 movies and should contain nearly every stephen baldwin movie someone with some talent could have at least made the effort not to ham it up as much someone anyone i couldn't get past the fact that everyone sounded like they were reading from a script save that is the only person in the whole friggin movie who has any talent whatsoever and thus should not have been in this mad tv's deborah wilson br br this was the capital cheese fest how truly embarrassing
<START> if it wasn't for the terrific music i would not hesitate to give this cinematic 2 10 but the music actually makes me like certain passages and so i give it 5 10
<START> the best scene of the people across the lake is the genuinely creepy nightly opening scene featuring a house a murder a lake after that it's pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned a family mom dad sister younger brother is fed up with the mildly dangerous environment of suburbia and decides to go and live near the titular lake from then on the film features too much lame happy family related doo doo near the lake with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there the couple of scenes where they discover the bodies are pretty convincing in terms of creepiness but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings on featuring just every day life stuff of the family settling in the truth to the matters the mystery as to who's doing the killing is learned too soon leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house like if this made for tv thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film it's not really badly made the content story is just not interesting enough the only highlight in the cast is barry corbin though his performance character is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious blond cutie tammy lauren the daughter might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too as she also starred in wishmaster 1997 and made for tv outings like i saw what you did 1988 the stepford children 1987 she hasn't got much to do in this film though but watchable if anything
<START> this is not a story it's a bunch of psychic needles reaching for your subconscious if you wait for a story you'll be bored but if you give yourself over to it you'll be inside it's dreamworld within 10 minutes the vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape leave room for your own fantasies the strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation the visual echoes of the crucifixion of christ the pulsating light and deep dark shadows they all reach to your subconscious to fill in this mind space i found myself trembling and unable to escape in front of my television it was like dreaming with eyes wide open a strange nightmare a bad trip a religious experience it touched me deep inside and marked me for live it freed my mind and gave me one of that rare experiences of loss of personality and merging with the world of archetypes a little freedom for the soul a violent freedom however not a nice movie but a very strong and unforgettable one literally my text has no spoilers for me the great surprise of this film was the unbelievable intensity of it and describing this can be understood as a spoiler the less you know about this film as you watch it the better
<START> i was expecting a documentary covering the 1950 to 1965 era of sci fi and received a big ol' commercial laced with leftist political innuendo by james cameron and movie mogul baby pushing the own works 'watch the has in the past referred to the 'giant and 'space exploration' movies from the 1950's including such favorites as earth vs the flying saucers thing from another world and forbidden planet as well as them deadly mantis and tarantula there are lower budget examples that rarely get mentioned like space monster 12 to the moon and cosmic man br br this would have been a much better documentary had the few remaining actors directors stunt men and collectors plus the non hollywood from the era been interviewed i only wish there was a 0 rating available since a 1 is much to generous
<START> well they've done it again a new pumpkin head film the first pumpkin head film was perfect for its time a dumb gory and clichÃ©d monster flick so heres how it goes some one loses their loved one goes to the witch in the woods gets her to raise pumpkin head and have it murder everyone responsible unfortunately the film makers have deemed it irrelevant to try and do any other than this for the films fourth outing it far more suitable to add some lame romeo and juliet sub plot involving an idiotic family feud over a car and surprise surprise some gory pumpkin head slayings so far so formulaic but it doesn't stop there the acting talent in this flick is dire oh so bad half of them can't even keep up a southern accent without slipping into their native and often posher accents lance is on board so surely he would bring some gravitas to the movies proceedings but no lance merely ambles on screen lets the words fall out mouth with absolutely no emotion or seemingly direction and walks off again i honestly think he just turned up for the money then went off to his trailer to drunk and reminisce about aliens br br this film is utter cack there is no redeeming feature other than it ending credits which signal its all over br br despite the failings of ph bf if you want a no brainer that'll make you laugh for all the wrong reasons watch it br br if you want something with more meat and originality avoid
<START> kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times he may have made more classics than anyone else he may have been a perfectionist but man was his first attempt ever bad br br kubrick had good reason to try to make this film from the map it looks like an ed wood film it has strange narration cheap shots bad dialogue ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci fi horror flick and what looks like relatives of the cast of reefer madness going insane for no reason br br sure you can see an undeveloped kubrick in there it is a psychological horror study of war the characters became dehumanized and insane there are people playing more than one role there are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people and there are a few interesting shots around there but really this is a mess br br of course i am not discouraging you from watching it if you get a hold of it you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it
<START> werner herzog again explores the psyche of a man in little dieter we meet an effervescent brilliant man who survived the war in seeing starvation and strange sights moved to the u s and fulfilled his dream of being a flier war food death survival hoarding planes heads coming off how one american is born herzog again sees madness as plane of existence and the surreal blends with the poignant as herzog himself narratives this psychic travelogue of a german becoming an american who flies prop planes in a late 20th century war where the culmination of technology pilgrimage and eating out of garbage cans with spoons is melded with constant optimism into a man redefined into american as always with herzog we are faced with florid madness brilliance and what is man in the face of his own excesses societal and personal we laugh and cringe and are amazed at this man where else for this man but america
<START> because they all just watch there mst3k with their artificial friends who make mostly not that funny and obvious comments about movies and that's the only way these people watch them and then they comment and down vote them on the imdb based just on that they don't even try to watch the film on it's own br br i watched this film on it's own i didn't read the reviews first i didn't have some people telling what to laugh at i just got the dvd bought for the flip side morons from outer space an old fave and watched it br br of cause i knew kind of what i was in for when it's a golan globus albert pyun film but usually they can be quite entertaining br br the film is a non too stressing on the brain alice down the rabbit hole story done so many times and kind of similar in basic structure but completely different in content to warlords of atlantis another entertaining b movie br br the voice was annoying but then that's the idea which they even poke at with a few lines in the movie br br the hero character had one of the worst over the top voices accents in english language film history but you grow to accept it and enjoy it br br it's not a good film but it's not a really bad film it's just a bit of an average b movie dtv kind of film nothing too new nothing too outstanding and probably would be enjoyed more by a younger age bracket say 7 14 year olds than i it's a bit of light hearted fantasy br br will i see it again probably not maybe about 10 years ago i would have br br don't be so harsh on a movie because a couple of puppets told you too this film isn't taking itself seriously and it's certainly no troll 2 or space mutiny
<START> this movie was really stupid and i thought that it wasn't so bad and i could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the cherry on top of a bad movie i could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness sakes the brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones the funny thing was that he could still move his hands that was just not right without muscles you really can't move your hands but he did the brother should have bled to death even before he was moving his hands the movie wasn't great but it was okay until the hand scene i was laughing so hard that i don't really remember how it ended it had something to do with foam or something
<START> this animated short is a remake of one of tex earlier shorts for fred quimby at m g m dog gone tired an escaped convict here just known as joe who just broke out of fizz prison' tries to keep one step ahead of droopy known here as sgt of the mounties but always manages to run into him one way or another this is easily one of the most side splitting funny shorts that rolled out of the m g m animation studio it manages to get most of it's laughs from the shocked reactions joe has whenever he encounters including some equally deranged sound effects i e car horns screaming elephants etc as with any avery m g m short frantic kinetic pacing is to be expected along with some nice surreal sight gags i e joe trying to run away from actually running off the side of the film pop this one into your dvd player laugh yourself silly
<START> every time i watch this movie blood comes gushing out of my eyes yes you read that correctly i've watched this wretched foul thing more than once br br caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons harold ramis dialing in a script and abandoning the direction duties rodney dangerfield wisely walking away from the project because they wouldn't allow him to tinker with the script bill murray showing excellent judgement and not being part of it and a puppet being pushed forward as the feature player of a cast who deserved much better br br i can't help but think of dyan cannon in this and wonder why she's perpetually laughing and smiling the only conclusion i can draw is that she is indeed the face of pure evil stay with me a moment she must have been watching as the film came together and revelled in the untold agony that it would inflict on countless soon to be extremely sorry movie goers who would have this film inflicted on them she may also have been extremely drunk that's what i need to be right now to wash the foul taste of this complete and utter failure out of my mind if i'm lucky it'll be washed out forever br br i have seen this film several times i blame several of them on childhood and being a very dull and dim witted boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility perhaps puppets are just funnier when you're a kid no the muppet show is funnier now guess i was just dull caddyshack 2 is that rare kind of film that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the end credits that it couldn't have been as bad as all that it was it is it will only get worse with time br br my reasons for going back to this film mercifully are becoming fewer randy quaid is limited in his role as jackie mason's lawyer his opening scene isn't bad and brought out my only chuckle we see him a few more times but it becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate rapidity from incidentally amusing to vapid wasteland randy quaid acquits himself well and this film owes him big time because if there was reason to watch this film as anything other than a torture tactic he was it br br maybe that's the trick of the movie it has enough potentially endearing qualities that people watch it are horrified at what they've done to themselves but later because the pickings were so slim can remember only what did actually amuse them years later they unwittingly watch it again and the cycle repeats br br jackie mason takes a lot of the blame for this film but in fairness i'm not sure he deserves it he's really trying out there but it is impossible to not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing a rodney dangerfield impersonation that's who the movie was written for but i'm not sure even he could have saved it ultimately this fails miserably through terrible direction bad editing shall we count continuity errors and a rehashing of the same story with none of the wry humour or heart that made the first film endearing br br dragged kicking and screaming up to a three out of ten instead of two by randy quaid's bulldog determination it isn't even bad enough to laugh at i've definitely seen worse but trust your memory this one is a dog if you've never seen it you've made excellent life choices and i salute your excellent judgement
<START> near wonderful mixture of comedy romance and medical chaos has a 50 ish swinging single doctor tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads dating a patient his own age whom he met on his rounds screenplay by julius epstein shows a fair amount of sophistication though he doesn't have enough material to fill out the picture's last third and one can almost feel the movie slipping the subplot about the hospital being investigated for its shoddy business affairs isn't worked out satisfactorily and it feels highly concocted anyway still walter matthau and glenda jackson are a terrific team richard benjamin and art carney very funny in support director howard keeps it all popping and even when epstein's one liners feel like neil simon rejects zips right along happily the results are dryly engaging and occasionally quite sweet followed by a failed tv series from
