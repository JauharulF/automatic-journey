<START> i'm not sure as to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy film when i first watched this i couldn't really make out the ending and that's the only part of movie that's seemed to lack depth and left me a bit depressed for awhile then i watched it a second time and realised how great the acting was and was clueless as to why it received the meager attention it did at the time br br unforgettable performances by the young and wood should have made this film a classic br br although the it was probably intended to be a fantasy drama by the original writer director evans once donner took over he presumably made it with a more dramatical outlook especially the ending which left a lot to be desired as to what really happened to bobby was he killed did he escape really do all those fantastic journeys or was it just an imaginary story woven by hanks to prove a point to the kids br br but in all it didn't provide the closure of a happy ending that we are so used to in a children's film perhaps it's because it's not just that br br to see what may have been a more classical ending check out the official elijah wood site where you'll find the first rough draft script of the conclusion of the movie presumably by the original writer br br also a note of the music by hans zimmer which is one the best soundtracks i've ever heard a mixture of childish and dark sentiments throughout the movie a great cd to get hold of if you can br br
<START> billy wilder continues his strong run of films during the 1950s with a biopic of charles lindbergh the young american pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the atlantic in 1927 jimmy stewart plays lindbergh and while he might be a bit too old for the part he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his trademark down to earth goodness that makes him an iconic film star wilder directs solidly balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what lindbergh was up against when he decided to take this challenge it certainly isn't his nor stewart's best work but it is a gem of a movie it lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an american overall it is just plain good
<START> man i went to this movie because of the great preview it looked like it had a great story and nice special effects br br boy was i wrong i wanted to walk out of the theater because of those horrible special effects a cartoon dino of cart board would do even a better job then this the story was fine if it would have been taken on by a big movie producer who would in some more money to make the effect more life like the only thing i liked about this movie where the plants that pop up everywhere br br even worse where the cars in one scene 2 characters walk along the street if you watch those cars you'll see the following taxi car motorcycle tri pod big bus and about 4x in a row br br and then there is the butterfly death that would set the whole evolution changes in to progress if that guy didn't step on the butterfly the next dino would have eaten it anyway so that's absolute bull then if you change something in the past the future will be different in the same instant not in those time waves they made but hey if the future changed in a split second the movie would be even worse but more realistic though this is just one of those movies you should see when you want to have a great laugh i spend way to much money on this movie in the theater and then they tell me this movie had 80 million dollar budget where did all that money go
<START> jim wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded komodo vs cobra no guesswork here a giant cgi komodo dragon it sort of looks like a dog minus fur takes on a humongous cgi king cobra with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between the tree huggers get charter boat captain michael pare who else to take them to an off limits federal island an experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large has become an experiment in growing very large critters thank so to our nutty military now all that's left on the island are the very large critters and the mad scientist's tiny shapely daughter the group runs into her at the old plantation lab the monsters arrive and the chase is on if you watch enough wynorski sci fi channel flicks you'll recognize some of the sets and locations from many other movies acting is nonexistent as is the plot at the very least you can enjoy watching the badly animated dog stomp down on its intended victims just before scarfing them up the cobra just strikes and swallows no imagination at all
<START> after sitting through this god awful 82 minute excuse of a film and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out after having watched another james directed mess called when will i be loved i've come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world how else can these horribly written painfully directed pieces of trash get made in the first place br br i like robert downey jr but perhaps being in this movie drove him to substance abuse br br heather graham has to be embarrassed about her zombified performance half the time the camera is on her she just is looking off in a daze br br such a crappy script prepare yourself for hollywood name dropping galore example five minute meandering discussions on denzel washington's acting etc br br there's a great character in joseph heller's novel catch 22 named dunbar he spends most of the time in the novel shooting skeet which he abhors when asked why he shoots skeet all the time if he hates it so much he replies that it makes time creep by and he'll have a longer life well if you really want to feel time creep by watch this film i swear the 82 minutes will feel longer than a 4 hour david lean epic it goes on and on and on and on br br i hope i never watch another james film again if i could give this no stars i would
<START> ruggero deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with jungle holocaust in 1975 but director umberto usually acknowledged as a deodato rip off directed the man from deep river 3 years earlier in 1972 is it a worthy start for the genre well not really br br a photographer accidentally kills a man in self defense and while retreating into the jungles of an asian country is captured by a native tribe who hold him captive force him into slave labor and eventually accept him when he marries the chief's daughter throughout the whole film i never felt this was a horror film it was more reminiscent of a drama like a man called horse which i liked better ivan rassimov is pretty good as the photographer but it is me me lai as the chief's daughter who is memorable and great i have always been a me me lai fan ever since her breathtaking performance in jungle holocaust and she is never given credit for her acting chops because she hardly speaks in her films she is still very talented and charming lots of real animal mutilation is the one thing about deep river that could make it a horror film but even that doesn't execute well br br the man from deep river is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenre but as an entry in the genre is easily eclipsed by deodato's entries and even lenzi's own later entries recommended only for completists and me me lai fans
<START> in the opening sequence of where's poppa george segal rises from his bed one morning shaves showers puts on a gorilla suit and goes into his mother's bedroom we realize later to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her out of his life forever this is about the level of humor one can expect from most of this picture insanity blended with what might be taken as morbid daring br br segal plays a new york attorney who lives with his supposedly senile mother ruth gordon whose life is further complicated when while hiring a nurse to care for the old bag meets the girl of his dreams the pleasantly prim trish van decked out like florence nightingale his dilemma how to integrate the lovely nurse into his and his pesky mother's life br br segal's performance is about the only thing holding the picture together his frustrations his reactions his comic timing is almost peerless whatever happened to that guy where the film fails is in other areas ruth gordon's characterization is dreadful as the mother at the beginning you can't figure out if her character is senile or just being deliberately vague to keep her son from moving out by the end it's clear she's just nuts when segal brings van home to meet her gordon's eyebrows and she gets a mean sinister look she wants the intruder in her son's life removed she's calculating this is not the mode of a senile person you're not getting a consistent performance throughout the picture which is probably the director's carl reiner fault as much as gordon's ruth gordon's old lady in rosemary baby is much more successful because with the kind of ingratiating cloying person that ruth gordon generally plays the audience responds to her as annoying but when mia farrow is too timid to fight back gordon becomes more cloying her fangs dig deeper and deeper and we're frightened for farrow this kind of imposition is genuinely terrifying here we're being asked to laugh at what we'd normally find annoying and if gordon played it as helplessly nutty all the way we might but she's selfish and mean as well and it dampens what little humor there is br br there are a few good laughs though a courtroom scene with barnard hughes as a military officer and rob reiner as a counterculture punk is fairly hilarious and vincent gardenia does a nice turn as a football coach there's also an inspired bit where segal's brother ron liebman having been stripped naked by muggers on his way to segal's place asks him for something for to wear home and he gives him the gorilla suit br br but of a lot of the script is poorly conceived and simply doesn't make sense why is a new york lawyer with his own practice even living at home in the first place why does segal if his mother is senile try to reason with her logically if you spoil this for me i'll punch your f ing heart out why does liebman keep cutting through the park if he knows he's going to get mugged why does he take a taxi after leaving segal's with gorilla suit why wasn't he taking taxis all along a funnier bit would have been liebman as the gorilla terrorizing the muggers why does van keep coming back after her first husband was a kook why does she want to get involved with this bunch i suppose if i put this to carl reiner he'd say are crazy people they don't have to make sense ' which is a convenient way to excuse a lousy script that's full of holes the characters' moment to moment behavior may not have to make sense but their motivations do and that's where where's poppa falls apart the situations are created just to have the gag and the gags are mostly one shots they don't build to anything br br carl reiner is the most guilty in this whole fiasco how he has acquired this vaunted reputation as a pillar of comedy puzzles me basically his career has been to hold a microphone in front of sid caesar and mel brooks while they talk in funny voices his son rob has ten times the skill and intelligence as a director in show biz terms reiner pushes buttons a monkey could do his job and that is most apparent in his framing of the action why is all of new york shot in tight and in close ups but the scenes in the country are all distant and panoramic that's the mentality of carl reiner's direction claustrophobic for the city spatial for the country in the final lunatic scene at the old folks home the camera is so far off you can't even make out what's going on the abrupt ending suggests a resolution that segal could have easily arrived at ninety minutes ago it also suggests reiner couldn't figure out how to end the picture so he just cut it as another example of craziness reiner seems to think dumbness equals craziness and craziness without logic is always funny it isn't and the creators of where's poppa are as demented as ruth gordon putting pepsi in her fruit loops
<START> i laughed at the movie the script the acting please don't we deserve better but now the filming some of the camera angles were interesting i did enjoy the film but it's not to be taken seriously though i liked it if it had a new cast and it would be better than all right it's worth a look
<START> i found this dvd in the store and figured why not support some indy film and watch a cool horror flick please save your time and money and pass this one by the acting the script practically everything with this film is sub par there really isn't much of a story and there is no character development i found myself not caring what happened to the people in the movie as long as something happened everyone is supposed to be college age but they all look like they are in their mid thirties except for the woman who plays a mother who looks like she is pushing 40 in fact the worst part of the film is that every single scene is shown in a master shot there is no editing no cut ins or close ups do yourself a favor and skip it
<START> ever since he played a goon in lone wolf actor stuntman kane hodder has been busy his film hatchet got all the publicity last year but he still makes a couple of more films every year he should have skipped this one br br hodder seems to be the king of the slashers he has played jason voorhees from 1988's friday the 13th part vii the new blood 1988 to jason x 2001 he is working on a new film that appears to be a halloween remake he is very much what i would call the serial killer type with his methodical expressionless thirst for blood br br however there wasn't much blood in this movie and very little action occurred on camera it felt as if i was watching an episode of real law enforcement on a e br br i won't put the blame entirely on hodder's shoulders as the rest of the actors didn't contribute much either br br michael berryman the hills have eyes the devil's rejects just ran his mouth until gein shut him up adrienne the bold and the beautiful was cute veteran actress three's company and penthouse pet priscilla barnes did a credible job i am sure there are other horror favorites but they all just seemed to run through their roles
<START> i don't think i've yet seen a movie in my whole lifetime about a high school kid creating his own college just to impress his parents nowadays movies are either remakes or sequels or plots that have been used in many different films this one has an original story line and to follow it up by making it a comedy films only lightens the deal with this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in this is a good movie now i've seen better but upon going into the theater i was thinking another drug beer frat party with some sexual innuendo tossed in aka an american pie flick but i was surprised to sum it up i enjoyed the film and the next time your shuffling through the paper for movies look for show times to accepted if you want to laugh out loud that is
<START> wretched talk about botched beyond the poseidon adventure is bad in every respect michael caine and karl malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaky tug boat they're challenged by ruthless telly savalas and his gang of machine gun toting goons this part sequel part remake has caine malden and another group of poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship among this group are shirley jones slim pickens peter boyle shirley knight and slim pickens jack warden plays a blind man surely you'll wish you were blind after seeing this mess sally field is particularly annoying as a stowaway on board caine's tug br br disaster master irwin allen not only produced this one he decided to direct it as well
<START> a rather charming depiction of european union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in barcelona where they are all studying on international central to the story is xavier who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in france but who quickly becomes a leader in the group helping them deal with landlords and other problems he learns about life and love rapidly has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance the rest of the cast also play well occasionally they all lapse into english when they want to make sure they are communicating uncertain about all their apartment mates' ability to understand french or danish or whatever the languages may be cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed towers
<START> animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful canadian film this short feature is dripping with canadian references and so this film will probably be appreciated by canadians most of all but the basic story is universal and it is told lovingly by writer carrier it is a hilarious story that i have known for quite sometime and i was recently fortunate enough to see it again so i simply had to write a hearty recommendation for it this is a masterpiece and a must see whether or not you are canadian
<START> a hugely enjoyable screen version of rona jaffe's best selling pot boiler about the trials and tribulations and naturally the loves of a group of women involved in one way or another in the new york publishing business directed by jean negulesco fairly fresh from the success of three coins in a fountain and the prototype for the likes of sex and the city except that here the sex all takes place off screen br br the bright young female talents of the day hope lange diane baker suzy parker martha hyer are all nicely cast while joan crawford pops up as a queen bitch of an editor who could probably eat meryl streep's miranda priestly and spit her out with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie the men include stephen boyd louis if it wasn't rossano brazzi it had to be louis robert evans before he decided wisely to go behind the camera and brian there are more suds on display than you will find in your average but if like me you enjoy desperate housewives not to mention carrie bradshaw and company then you will probably love this a very guilty pleasure
