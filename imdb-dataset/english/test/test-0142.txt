<START> the thing has to be one of the all time great movies of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that impressed me so much back in 1982 it just blew my mind i'd never seen anything like that however although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific it was the story itself the music score the claustrophobic atmosphere of the as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic br br movies don't get any better than this in the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam yet when you see them continue their chase at the us base you then think that the norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo you just know that something is not right at this point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself br br however the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of agatha christie who dunnit i e ten little indians movie sci fi style as the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien the mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown br br after 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in the thing don't carry the same weight as it did in 1982 but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast
<START> i cannot understand why so many people did not like this film robert de niro was on top of his game delivering his lines with such aplomb one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor granted the film seemed to take on many buddy film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept it goes without saying this film was genuinely funny from the police dog to the fact eddie murphy didn't annoy the heck out of me this film is a real keeper rene russo also evened out the rest of the cast perfectly establishing her role so it does not interfere with the budding relationship between de niro and murphy
<START> first of all i'm upset there's no choice of a 0 out of 10 br br i was bored tonight and while flipping through the channels i see dr chopper with there being nothing else on i decide to watch it expecting it to be just another crappy horror movie with a similar plot to cabin fever br br man was i wrong dr chopper made cabin fever look like it should have won numerous academy awards may i remind you cabin fever contains a scene of a little hick boy doing roundhouse kicks off of a porch screaming pancakes characters who leave their dying friend in a tiny shack to bleed to death and shawn from boy meets world mistakenly fingering a hole in a girl's thigh br br so needless to say dr chopper was a big smelly pile o crap it wasn't even funny crap it reminded me of a horror movie i had to make in 8th grade called the campout except for the fact that the campout had a better script we wrote it about an hour before filming better actors plots bloody scenes and camera work i was hoping to get some laughs out of a poorly made horror film but instead i could only watch in astonishment as i thought to myself was this made by 8th graders br br the acting was horrible the events and different little subplots were thrown together and didn't make sense and the gore and violence was very minimal i liked how that from a small stab wound people died instantly and the only weapons the killers had were small pocket knives if you're going to make a horror movie at least give the killer s an insane killing device br br also what the hell was the point of the sorority girls hazing their pledges good way to bring in some scenes of girls running around in their bras even if they have no relevance to the story whatsoever and i must say my favorite line was when the blonde says to dr chopper i'd like to introduce you to someone my inner bitch her inner bitch then proceeds to grab a garbage can throw it at dr chopper miss and back up in terror of the killer br br well that was a long one but i felt that i needed to express my feelings on how absolutely horrible this movie was i know that everyone has their own opinions but if anyone rates this movie higher than a 2 they should be shot to hell br br seriously
<START> this movie is the latino godfather an unlikely mobster bridges the gap to some unlikely alliances and forms an empire i enjoyed the action and gunfights along with the brash acting and colorful characters this movie is no oscar winner but definitely entertaining hey who needs an oscar anyway br br has got some balls to direct act i think he produced it too this movie reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do it all robert rodrigez keep it up is there a sequel in the works there are a bunch of strings that need to be tied son comes back and avenges dads death
<START> it's great to hear the 3 or so comments that point out what wives' signifies for women the title alone washes away any supposed equality women have in the media industry or society reducing them to two dimensional cartoon caricatures of how men think women should behave it is a post modern moronic farce it might as well be called who stays at home and knows her place' br br on one hand it could actually be some sort of parody on the u k 's gutter trash press representation of celebrities and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society so women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and own the image that has been created for them by mens desire nah that would be to ironic and clever i also sound like i should be praising it br br zoe is simply too camp and over the top to be taken seriously just like an even cheaper cruella de ville she just needs some maniacal condescending yet at the same time self laugh to show off her true acting range oh she does right anyway it just about sums up whom this is aimed at either who think its an up roaring send up of vaudevillian proportions or people who think its 'real' finest actors omg stop watching this afterbirth of a pantomime and get a life br br its utterly sexist and is of such low quality that maybe those who enjoy it think they are in on the joke do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating its so demeaning to women and men they are not all self centred selfish football loving materialistic jerks who think women are nothing but another trophy to be put on display for the public it's so humiliating i am sure ms would easily stand up to them in her real life and twist them round her finger as so easily done in wives' br br but of course its doesn't really matter i mean its only a t v programme after all so please let it stay axed it's dreadful and will only be looked back on in the same disbelief that 'prisoner cell block h' was so fondly remembered for br br how did it come to exist it sure ain't subtle or complex it could only come from the same mind set who read magazine and think its alright to look at soft porn and do as many women who bow to their will and chant patriotic and racist comments whenever their football team losses wins it's totally crass
<START> there's nothing new in this movie nothing you haven't thought about before nothing you haven't heard before the story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of people can be broached in many ways and this movie has chosen the most demagogic and slushy one one of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it isn't neither a movie nor a documentary the director has used the of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if it was a movie the result is weird and finally i read in previous comments that stated that people who don't like this movie are anti gay i'm pretty sure this comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant but don't tolerate that other people don't like this movie this is a funny world
<START> a conversation about how jan michael vincent is a lush led me to foolishly re visit this mid 90s dtv entry a kid is traumatized when he sees an ice cream man gunned down in the 1950s and he grows up to be a psycho ice cream man clint howard something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice cream blah blah blah br br director norman credited as paul norman made a career of doing porn before this and went right back to it afterward that is what you get for having all murders happen off screen and for casting a skinny kid as a fat kid and making him wear a fat suit just cast a fat kid also there is a scene where vincent stoically reacts to a group of escaped loonies surrounding him he was either totally drunk and was frightened for his life or the filmmakers captured his have i really sunk this low shame full on despite being low budget trash this did line up a few good names including david naughton olivia hussey david warner and the people court's own doug how you can make a boring slasher with that cast is beyond me
<START> i saw and have the original 1959 black and white that stars shelley winters and millie perkins and no matter how many times i watch it i can't help but not to cry br br this version was obviously a set like the 1959 was but there were so many mistakes in layout spiral staircase items that did not exist in that time period existed in the film doris roberts sad to say cannot play drama she a comedic actress and that will not change james coco was a horrible mr van and mr resembled a college professor of mine rather then the dentist he was supposed to play in the original film anne walked the gauntlet to go to peter's room that seemed to take her more then a minute in this crappy remake it took her under 10 seconds the first reviewer was correct this remake is just that a remake what was the director thinking casting comedic actors in a drama role like that i'm sorry but james coco cannot play drama max schell was better in deep impact then this movie the cranky mrs frank was just that cranky i couldn't stand her referencing and comparing to the 1959 version i like her better she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother out of 10 stars i give this remake 3 don't waste your time get the 1959 version and a box of kleenex
<START> being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film i was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller coaster ride alas br br where to start on this mess i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny i was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut br br the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to run but to me its just puts an even higher on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created br br the acting at times is pathetic fielding is wasted as the loony mrs and i've seen simon pegg have much better outings br br i'd recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more but to any bottom fan who hasn't seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned
<START> when you look at mexico's best movies you will more than likely find that the photography was performed by gabriel figueroa he is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed his master control of the cameras gave an added asset to the movies he was part of if added to his participation we add the direction of luis bunuel you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world this story was written by spain's greatest writer besides miguel de don de la mancha the story in itself is superb a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very christian life but as always there are people that do not accept this he wanders through many places preaching his christianity but finding most of the time people that do not accept him but besides the splendid story it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that bunuel sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you shiver
<START> didn't have much aspiration for this film but was pleasantly surprised very well made film very well cut doesn't really get to the height that human traffic did but it's a very good effort well directed and i thought the lead actor put in a superb performance in fact the only really bad performance in the film was from tim curry who is supposed to be the name br br cool film surprised it hasn't done better than it has i'd never heard of it until i saw it at a mates br br i'm not a raver but i imagine people who are will really like this film
<START> a woman who deals in art starts to have a passionate love affair with a man named john they make love everywhere they go and they play sexual games the problem i had was that was all they did there was no plot at all to this movie or i just didn't see it the hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie but i wanted something else to happen perhaps he could have been a serial killer or she could have had a secret i just needed something and all that there was was a bunch of love making scenes not that's it was bad or anything i just wanted more things to happen in the movie perhaps a coworker was sleeping with him too anything i was greatly upset that this was all that there was mickey rourke was so hot back then i wonder what happened
<START> for me reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film and of horror cinema in particular the reviews i've written thus far have been for films that i love respect and admire and i have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect ten ratings a life long horror movie fan it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films and to hopefully have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out i only recently began reviewing films for the imdb and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites examining those which i believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre however the existence of films like graduation day is without pun a thorn in my side completely devoid of any merit whatsoever this 1981 hodgepodge of unformed ideas is amateurishly directed poorly acted and in every sense an unmitigated embarrassment to horror cinema during the brief couple of years before and after this movie's release we saw the appearance of domestic and canadian films such as halloween ii prom night terror train madman my bloody valentine the prowler just before dawn final exam and hell night among others these films though of varying degrees of quality clearly strove to achieve something in terms of story line plotting acting direction and overall tone not every movie released during this bountiful season of the slasher era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original halloween or friday the 13th but these films were all well made and clearly contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema graduation day an abysmal farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team was directed by herb freed whom one can only hope will never again attempt to the horror genre with such a travesty the task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre this movie fails miserably on every possible level not the least of which are dreadfully wooden performances dime store special effects an irritating musical score and most of all a story lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense a pointless exercise in how to waste film graduation day is an utter disgrace to horror cinema
<START> i had the misfortune of seeing this effort on television a few years ago suffice it to say michael gross phones in his performance and hasselhoff is the least convincing thief psycho ever if you have a couple of hours to kill watch it and prepare to laugh
<START> this movie is horrible you won't believe this hunk of junk is even a movie was better then this and was pretty frigging bad too a bunch of stupid teens crash in a desert find an old run down bungalow and end up fending off horrifically badly stop motion animated spiders pardon my french but the acting was bad as hell the person who wrote this probably didn't even know what a spider is because he had the spiders living in a colony serving an alien queen ripoff queen spider spiders do not live in colonies this movie is a piece of crud at the end the marines suddenly pop out of no where and kill all the spider without even being called if you see a copy of this movie at a video store it in gasoline and throw a match at it
