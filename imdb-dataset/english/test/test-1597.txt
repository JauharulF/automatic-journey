<START> perry mason the case of the fatal fashion finds perry and della street in new york getting an award from the american bar association an undefeated trial record ought to get some recognition i would think anyway a friend of della's fashion editor diana muldaur gets herself arrested for the murder of a rival valerie harper and in fact raymond burr and barbara hale witness a confrontation between the two at a posh eatery br br these two rivals have a thing going that makes and louella look like school girls of course harper has a number of other people who loved her equally as much br br the same perpetrator also ran down a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual this throws perry with his trusty investigative lawyer william moses in an alliance with some mobsters seems that the designer was a cousin of a mob boss who wants also to out some justice in their usual manner br br one thing i could not get is when moses and mobster robert track down the perpetrator i cannot believe that the police were also not vigorously pursuing the case of course has some access to sources that the cops just don't have br br but the best part of this particular mason entry is scott baio as the young rather full of himself assistant district attorney introducing himself to raymond burr saying how he studied all of his cases and looked forward to beating him foolish boy br br in fact my favorite scene is burr and baio at a sidebar with the judge baio was wanting to reopen his case and add a witness and came ready and prepared with precedents burr catches him off guard and says he has no objection to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish the witness on cross examination absolutely priceless br br scott baio is the best thing in this particular perry mason movie and it should be seen for him alone if nothing else
<START> this movie was an excellent acted excellent directed and overall had an excellent story ive had real life with a boy like at the football program in my town weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice travel and have fun with the football team this movie is really true and i can identify with it 100 a boy like just needs to feel like they belong to something they need to feel like their life is worth living thats how feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school this is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen my dad and i loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man
<START> i'm not sure if these other people saw the movie some apparently couldn't follow the complicated plot he's a billionaire who owns an oil company who also happens to big game hunt wow that's really far fetched any way his new drilling machine happens to break through a glacier and on the other side is a world seperated from our own time where dinosaurs and cavemen wander around nothing ground breaking about this but it certainly isn't ludicrous anyway the rest of the movie is about this t rex they find which the billionaire boone claimed was there hunting them and them hunting it look it's an old made for tv movie of course the special effects look cheesy they didn't have cg they did the best they could and for a they did a hell of a job for the time this movie should be remade for the big screen i'd love it and i'd be the first one in line seeing that dinosaur with modern day special effects stalking those guys would be great
<START> this movie was chosen quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local video store it turned out to be quite a pig the plot line such as it is was disjointed inconsistent and predictable the actors constantly looked embarrassed to be mouthing the poorly written lines the only funny moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the deployment of an airbag the remainder of the film lacked the punch to amuse either of my young daughters aged less than ten years myself my wife my mother in law or even the cat or the dog my advice if you are tempted to borrow this turkey is to save your money and your time look for something else
<START> i guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as the intended audience you can either say to yourself a let's make a movie that kids today will love or b let's make a movie that i would have loved when i was a kid the second approach explains why steven spielberg often make movies that appeal to a younger audience prime examples are e t the goonies or indiana jones that darn cat is an example of the first approach you see these flat unbelievable characters saying things that is supposed to be funny but isn't the plot itself is enough for a ten minute short but instead it goes on and on and although i'm not a kid i don't quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for kids the clumsy cops chased by a dog the old lady with a tweety bird or christina ricci's sarcastic oneliners one actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humour doug e doug playing the fbi agent
<START> it isn't too bad but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series has br br the jokes are few and far between the actors are attractive they shouldn't be the film makers think far too much about the cinematography it's supposed to look like a home video and it's just like a serious version of and kim it's stupid br br it's too normal to be and kim and kim are supposed to be two curvy middle aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes there are no look at me kimmy jokes the fat friend of kim is not fat at all and she's not even slightly stupid she's a stereotypical black latino chick br br it's just not as stupid or funny as the australian series it doesn't compare nothing is the same i admit this show is pretty funny at times but it is not anything like the aussie series i was looking forward to an american take on a family they failed it's supposed to be really stupid and hilarious but the actors don't act stupid to me this is just a typical american tv show it's a let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie show br br 2 stars because it is an okay show just nothing like what it should be
<START> i debated quite a bit over what rating to give this one because it's my least favorite herschell gordon lewis film so far other than the gruesome twosome but it has the best acting i've seen in a lewis film however we all know that's not saying much once the movie was done i was happy because it felt like i had been sitting through a 4 hour movie though it was only 82 minutes long i'm trying to see all of films and that's probably the only reason to see this one br br the gore is good as usual the one thing that herschell seemed to get right the acting is just as bad as usual with one exception that exception is frank now would i say that he's a good actor no way but he's good compared to everyone else the story is boring and flat and goes no where and by the end i didn't care what happened just so long as it ended i know this is a cult classic but i didn't enjoy it very much at all i hope you will
<START> nothing is worse than the of our world's history this film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family a common narrative device in the atomic bomb world of hiroshima the most memorable parts are the graphic and saddening images that the people of hiroshima face in the aftermath of war the story however becomes more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they cope with getting on with their lives in other words if you don't really care about them the film grows boring it's hard not to care though when a family's homeland is wrecked i'm not sure if i would recommend this film because it says very little politically and honestly did not keep my interest in the family's troubles
<START> cinema at its best is entertainment if one is to question every aspect with which one finds room for disagreement and much of recorded history is based on contemporary opinions often biased then one should leave the cinema because their prejudices will always spoil their enjoyment when i spotted an airplane flying overhead in a film dated i was amused the background scenery in casablanca is absurdly fake so do i set up a moan say that the film failed to convince fiona relax and enjoy some excellent acting decision to cast the protagonists as french polish was inspired one was immediately aware of which side each of the main characters was representing no need to dwell on the authenticity of the wigs this is powerful cinema if there is a political message which is still relevant today have a dinner party a chÃ¢teau with the gras a with the some polish vodka and perhaps a 1961 chÃ¢teau rothschild with the beef and discuss the political aspects of until you drop with fatigue would surely have agreed
<START> george c scott gives his finest and funniest with wonderful drama as well in this paddy screenplay diana rigg is attractive and quite the complicated young woman this film veers between tragedy and chaos in a new york hospital of the late 60's with staggering consequences barnard hughes is delightful as always great stage actor as well br br an 8 out of 10 best performance george c scott was a big blow hard when he put down vanessa redgrave at the 1978 oscar ceremony but he's a good writer a truly ensemble cast that works wonders down to the smallest role this won best script at oscars and scott was nominated he should have won for this instead of patton the year before which he was also brilliant in seek this out
<START> jim henson always seemed to put out wonderful television shows this was sadly one of the shortest lived it was endearing to hear each tale with their delightful morals each episode was a new story with new characters john hurt did a wonderful job playing the storyteller and the sarcastic tone of brian henson as the dog was always enjoyable br br the set designs and costumes were very well done the muppet work when required is classic jim henson work you know it is a muppet but it's endearing appearance more than forgives you find yourself enchanted and compelled when each episode comes to an end you realize that you were quite entertained an entertained that is fulfilling not the kind that wears off after a few moments you sit back and think about each episode realizing that each story is indeed timeless and presents a strong tale of morality br br i have yet to show this to my own children but this is indeed a series that is more than family entertainment i implore you to find it on dvd and snatch it up if you can't do that then just find it some how
<START> it has been recorded that john ford made the big blockbuster movies so that he could afford to make the small movies that he loved so well wagon master with a young ben johnson is clearly one of his best if not the best of his small movies the location shooting the wagons the intricate work with horses and the inclusion of the plains indian are all trade marks of ford as in many of his other films eisenstein the great russian director's influence is seen in this film the supporting cast including ward bond russell simpson and jane darwell are excellent as well as the many minor character actors ford used including his brother the one who plays the drums while ben johnson went on to win a well deserved supporting oscar for the last picture show his co star harry carey jr did not reach those heights although his father carey sr became a western leading man in ford's early films carey jr spent most of his career in supporting roles for fans of john ford and for fans of western films this one is a must
<START> keys to the vip an original series by the canadian comedy network ca scored big with this entertaining yet inspirational gameshow this show is hosted by four funny good looking guys who judge others on their ability to pick up women each episode features two guys who go head to head in various pick up games there are three different sections and the winner scores a night as a vip in an exclusive toronto night club br br being a guy i naturally find this show hilarious we all know that it's hard to confront women and watching these guys do it naturally sparks the curiosity of men the guys who compete on this show might even give you a few pointers if you pay attention
<START> eric roberts stars in this tommy lee thomas debut prison film he plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards though evil by most people's standards his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with lethal weapon electric prods br br the movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense thomas has clint eastwood's eyes dolph lundgren's one liners the acting abilities of and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation br br martin cobra kai career shares this low point with roberts in the film it is difficult to tell if character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if kove just came that way i couldn't blame him if he did br br fortunately for all involved this movie has a so bad that it's good quality that can be fun if you have absolutely nothing better to do
<START> there is so much bad to say about this movie and so little that's good br br the plot has enough holes to sink the titanic the characters are completely unbelievable the monsters are so unrealistic and i'm sick and tired of seeing movies that involve an ex husband and ex wife being thrown together in some bizarre emergency it happens far too often in films and it's become another bad clichÃ© br br i find it hard to believe that anybody would have invested 1 in making this garbage never mind the 100 or so it must have cost br br you could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer i didn't think movies could get this bad avoid it at all costs do something that's more fun and enjoyable such as having a tooth pulled or an enema
