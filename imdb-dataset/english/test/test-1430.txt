<START> awful awful awful drab unimaginative predictable and with all the usual suspects exactly the sort of film the irish film industry shouldn't be making and with the added bonus of a treacle coated ending a sickening example of how talent originality is by passed in favour of an almost aggressive mediocrity yes the children are sweet yes it almost looks like it's done professionally but this is film making by numbers a direct smash and grab on what the director obviously thinks is a film which and despises the audience it's quite amazing that working title would pour into this rubbish but then they paid for love actually don't waste your money
<START> seldom is seen a film sequel that surpasses or even the greatness of it's original predecessor such a film is virtual encounters 2 br br it's about a couple guys in college who sell virtual sex to the entire campus if you like seeing naked chicks this one delivers six foot tall chrissy styler is an amazing specimen and you will be dreaming about her for days if you ever have the good fortune to catch the unrated version she wears just the right amount of body glitter in her multiple nude scenes and her giant cans appear to be real br br w the exception of james cameron's aliens francis for coppola's the godfather part ii and of course the airplane 2 this is the only sequel in movie history that takes a classic film and improves upon it br br it's criminal the way this film was ignored by the academy nikki fritz and that broad who gets tied up in the beginning as well as the brunette who gets a towards the end all deserved best supporting actress nods br br shame on you hollywood
<START> let me ask you one more question ha what a great soon this movie was brilliant fantastic acting great script the only reason no one noticed it was because of the low budget everyone will agree with me that its a cult just like donnie brasco it shows a young joe pesci once again as a mobster this film is up their with the cults its got some sopranos and some goodfellas chase got his idea for the sopranos when he watched this and scorsese found joe pesci while watching it that proves it must be a great am i right or am i wrong i've got to admit they showed one brilliant scene where they were throwing peanuts at a camp piano player stop with the friggen peanuts
<START> wow where do i begin after suffering through this wretched 1 00 rental thanks a lot family video i just had to make a few comments i did not bother to write down the names of the 3 actors in the film but hopefully you will know who i am talking about br br a monster truck terrorizes the countryside and chases two college aged buddies to their doom they encounter a hot girl wearing slutty clothes i mean this just sounds fantastic in theory i was laughing hysterically at the dvd box while i walked it up to the girl behind the counter at the video store br br acting the hot girl played by aimee whatever is visibly laughing through many scenes where she is supposed to be scared the other two major actors in the film the fat prankster and the vanilla straight guy are both terrible the fat guy thinks he's jack black he's not the other actor our hero over emotes and misses all his cues and comes across as some generic character you might see in a made for nickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early 90's look i don't expect great performances in movies like these but at least the actors can make an effort to not be annoying you can be an incompetent actor but still be agreeable i e john wayne at least that aimee gal is attractive br br script holy who thought this dialogue was funny i wouldn't have the nerve to play this out in front of my grade school drama class much less pitch it as a film script unfathomably bad more on this later br br production ok this is the one place where the film definitely succeeds production quality is amazingly high the look of the film is very good apparently the only talented person who worked on the movie was the director of photography br br ok here are my biggest gripes 1 the guy driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles an hour br br 2 the guy driving the car is well out into the country before he realizes there is a fat man in a mask in his back seat he is supposedly meticulous about recording gas mileage and keeping his antique car in good condition but he does not notice a jack black impersonator in the back come on br br 4 characters never change their clothes there are two hotel scenes presumably showers are available to our characters yet over the 3 days this movie takes place none of the characters bothers to change their clothes br br 5 comedy lighthearted slapstick comedy does not mix with horror period you can't have our characters running away from a monster truck one second and the next second have them verbally jousting one another with some dopey light comedy music playing this kind of pacing virtually ruins any tension in the movie movies like evil dead 2 which mix comedy and horror understand that tension can be loosened yet never completely eliminated with humor monster man doesn't get it br br i'm irritated that what could have been a very funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was a lot more clever than he really was oh well
<START> i saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes i read somewhere that oz and wanted to poke fun at liberal message movies but the climax ends up being right out of one of those movies also some of the humor is a bit on the cloying side joan cusack was too over the top for me and someone has a strange timeline re the oscars still there were more than enough funny moments like the kiss scene the wedding that isn't and the scene with the principal to enjoy this kline as always is good but for me the real surprise was selleck whom i'm not a big fan of but pokes fun at himself nicely here
<START> this film looks great and that's about where my praise ends love is a many thing came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955 when candy coloured nonsense like this co existed with trail blazing artistic fair like kiss me deadly as a trend toward smaller socially conscious films like on the waterfront and marty established itself in the mid 50's other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade and love is one of the latter br br this is the kind of 50's movie where the technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high key even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day i never want to hear the theme song again as it's played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime and i certainly don't want to hear it sung by the shrill ear piercing choir that belts it out over the end titles jennifer jones and william holden are passable but really anybody could have played these parts jones' role is horribly written her character is incredibly inconsistent and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be br br people will undoubtedly tell me i'm taking this film too seriously that i'm unromantic etc but i loved all that heaven allows released the same year and just as cornball in its own way except that douglas sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form whereas henry king director of love is not br br i'm usually able to enjoy bad melodrama but in this case i was just bored br br grade d
<START> barney and friends the dora the explorer of the 1990s br br ok i'll admit it as a kid barney was my ultimate hero i had my barney plush toy and i used to watch the same barney episodes over and over on videotape maybe cause it was so sugar coated and mind numbing br br however by the time i turned 7 i started to hate barney everyone at school would dis barney and i went along with it mainly because it was funny and it's what little boys do but a few years later i discovered something else about barney that i will never forget br br a person known on the imdb as angel did an essay for school explaining the dangers of watching barney and he or she posted it in the message boards a lot of those dangers made sense br br barney is a dinosaur who can magically come to life during a day at school he is supposedly educational or so sheryl leach barney's creator says but really all i can remember him teaching me is that magic can solve anything which is not true br br to end off this comment i'd like to tell you a little story there was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of barney one day he was alone when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him i don't know the outcome but it's safe to assume the child died but why was he abducted in the first place because he watched the barney and friends episode titled a stranger is a friend you haven't met yet br br 0 10
<START> i hoped to learn something from this movie but i was disappointed it is all about rommel and him as a great general but at no time in this entire movie did we ever get an idea of why he was great what made him so successful was it his drive his unwillingness to accept defeat his discipline with his men i was looking for a patton like rendition that really gets into the character but this fell way flat most of the dialog is contrived and sensationalized and feels stale and artificial there is some good action here and there but not much the tail end of the story which discusses his involvement in the plot to assassinate hitler was the most informative part and probably the most interesting but as a history lesson on germany's greatest general this was a failure
<START> i bought this thing used at a video game store's clearance bin i wanted to get that guilty feeling from watching something i've been warned is too intense to watch i wanted the shock value i wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a banned film i was very disappointed br br cannibal ferox does not work because it is so campy and fake most of the time the camera does not show you the shocking stabs chops slicing you just see the aftermath they do show a breast hooking in detail the special effects are just ok nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real the cannibals are obviously poor people from central south america who were dressed up as jungle savages and told to act mean these people were obviously in on the whole picture to get a little money or food or both again just not convincing br br however like everyone else has said there is some real killing of animals going on here that is the extent of the realism to me that was more shocking than any gutting chopping of scalps or castration and even then the animal deaths are not that gory at all maybe just sad
<START> surprisingly kieslowski's this movie is disappointing to me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes clichÃ© script that also seems a work of a poor observation sometimes there is an isolated young boy he lives with one of his relatives but he is lonely and every night watches a woman who lives across their building it seems that he wants her he is one of the youths who are not good at communication with the opposite sex however he likes that woman when the woman comes to his house with a man gets pain then we understand that kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a female to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman he does not do something else because may be he knows that it is his salvation one day he stops that woman suddenly he seems a shy boy but proves that he is not so he explains her almost everything she lectures and refuses him everything is so realistic like the other kieslowski films no problem the problems start when visits her the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman but an unrequited love turns into the story of a lonely young boy falls in love with a mature woman at the beginnings the woman refuses but after a short time she starts to change her mind this u turn makes the movie clichÃ© firstly the personality of is weird or a result of a poor observation i disappointed with this character this is my opinion and i will try to tell why when he goes to her house magda treats him very friendly she asks what do you want from me to kiss me to make love with me to go out with me at this point i remember the people who say she is a femme fatale see returning to the scene rejects all the proposals why because he is shy i don't think so but his communication is blunt ok after the leg scene at home some events make the movie misses its aim i think that the aim of the movie is should have been according to the story to show us there are some people who suffer from lack of endearment and to save from this situation is not easy owing to lack of communication and being aloof especially for men i mean that at this point what does the movie say it is blurred and disappointing it is seen that he is not hunger for love or a female or sex then what and the suicide attempt scene support this weakness so that he touches her legs he wants to kill himself by the way as i mentioned before some say magda is a femme fatale totally not she endeavors in order to make happy does she avoid having contact with him no does she insult him no does she amuse him no and does she deceive him no she has some troubles with her ex lover so she is not o k however she does not take revenge for it from she is not an angel but not a femme fatale also
<START> this is by far the most pathetic movie indian cinema or any cinema has come up with it is totally a piece of crap the story line odes not hold any water it is shameful that such a respectful actor has stooped to such a low on making such a disgraceful movie the little respect he had is lost forever he should have retired longtime ago instead of making a fool of himself and loosing all the self respect i would not recommend this movie to any one furthermore i would suggest that amitabh should retire already i wonder how imdb has given some recommendations to this movie there are no movies so horrible that any recommendations could be made seeing such movies as devdas in the same line as this movie does a grave injustice to a decent movie its overall i could say shameless
<START> a humorous voyage into the normally somber funeral business it's easy watching and even offers blethyn molina stealing a scene from an old fred ginger movie walken is over the top as a zealous competitor of molina in the undertaking business trying to bring a new style to an old welsh town we see a couple of very funny examples of the new style the plot thickens with pugh having an affair with watts and her suggesting that they do blethyn in meanwhile molina has his long suffering romantic feeling for blethyn and convinces her to fake her death so that they can run away to the south seas and dance away their days together during the fake funeral blethyn learns of her husbands' infidelities and plots her revenge watch it for a view of what funerals probably should be a celebration of life
<START> if you find the hopelessly amateurish acting the uninteresting story the fake blood and all the mindless shooting bearable then you may actually have a fairly good time watching this trashy low rent exploitation film you might also want to check out a pretty good sequence that's offered although it's not good enough to make the rest of the movie worth sitting through
<START> i was watching this movie and getting increasingly bored with the silly plot that was going nowhere when suddenly the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor playing herself oh how i guffawed because it's sooooo funny isn't it we know julia roberts is playing the character of tess and here they are in the film cracking the joke that the character of tess looks a bit like julia roberts so julia plays someone impersonating julia how well she does this we'll never know because 99 999 of the audience don't actually know julia roberts personally and reading about her in hello magazine doesn't count br br and then bruce willis turns up apparently he's julia roberts' best friend well he is in the film how would i know whether or not bruce willis and julia roberts even know each other i'm not in the least bit interested in the personal lives of actors i just pay my money and expect them to do the job they're paid to do anyway they start cracking jokes about the plot twist in the film where willis rather unconvincingly plays a psychiatrist the one with the little kid in it you know the one i don't i've forgotten what it's called willis even drops in a comment about how well that film did at the box office how modest of you mr willis br br the problem is that not only are these scenes pointless and horribly horribly self indulgent it also remind us the viewers that we're simply watching a bunch of actors strutting around and getting paid vast sums of money for very little effort you see when i see a movie i want to suspend disbelief and forget that i'm watching actors i want to believe in the story i'm watching when you start pulling the scenery down mid movie you simply ruin the illusion for me br br you know that a tv series has jumped the shark when it starts introducing celebrities playing themselves stand up and be counted the simpsons friends etc but this is the first time i've seen a movie jump the shark i usually stay away from movies like that e g scary movie the naked gun etc the trouble is i honestly never thought the ocean's 11 films would go in this direction what a shame br br so with suspension of disbelief thrown out the window and the plot now languishing in the movie then cracks the most wicked joke of all on the audience the heist actually happened way back in the story and the final 90 minutes or so of the film was pointless posturing yes that's right steven and his actor friends all get up point at us the audience and say ha you've all been had thanks for your money then they give us the single fingered salute br br well right back at you i didn't actually pay to see this movie i downloaded the dvd for nothing how d'ya like them apples now that's a plot twist
<START> this is a cult film for many reasons first because of the phenomenal success as a musical both in broadway and london then as a musical film the film is close to the play and some of the provocation of the play is no longer provocative twelve years later the discourse against the vietnam war is no longer a protest song against the war itself but a strong song demonstrating how the young people of these late 60s managed to bring the political establishment down milos forman play with some situations at the end of the 70s like the narrow minded justice the self centered umbilical righteousness of the rich or of the little ones who have just one rank of power more than the powerless he also heavily plays with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he builds all the time the film remains pleasant and thoughtful and of course it is a tremendous thrill to remember these years when we have had the privilege and that was not a chance to live them november 11 1969 nixon ordering mass celebration for the 1918 armistice which became the order for teachers at all levels to take their students to the celebration and the march supporting thus the invasion of cambodia that was in full swing and some dare give lessons in democracy to foreign countries i also remember the long campaign for the of nixon in 1973 1974 that will eventually lead to his resignation and the swearing in of gerald ford the first vice president and eventually president of the us who had not been elected since he was appointed vice president by the senate after agnew had to resign to face trial conviction and sentence for embezzlement of course that makes us think of today when in 2000 a president of the us was not elected by the people but by the supreme court or of a war that was rejected by millions world wide from the very start and even before the start and was started against the better judgment of the united nations and of three permanent members of the security council and some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others modern western man seems to have some problems understanding that the world is changing and has already widely and wisely changed modern western man seems to be kind of out of sync and to need special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority and the west is far from that majority and that if the soviet block had been able to understand that market economy is not capitalism but that market economy can be either socialist or capitalist the berlin wall would have fallen but the other way round and that china has learned that lesson marvelously well and is at the foot of the wall they have to climb over to learn that their socialist market economy has to lead to political democracy but they will just like vietnam was able to reconstruct itself after thirty years of vicious war aggression and damage in other words hair is a perfect food for thought br br dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
