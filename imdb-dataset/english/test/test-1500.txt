<START> i love just about everything the late al adamson directed in his long and varied career but the possession of nurse sherri stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade z like horror of the blood monsters and dracula vs frankenstein this film is actually scary am i saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch nurse sherri no of course not but this pastiche of elements from the exorcist ruby and carrie is one of those nice eerie little horror movies common to the seventies you can't put your finger on what's so spooky about it but the film drips with atmosphere and what an ending don't worry i won't spoil it for you adamson and producer sam sherman really nailed it with this one and it doesn't matter whether nurse sherri was a calculated success or a happy accident jill jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader bill roy who shines in his brief role geoffrey land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend there are some elements here profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive in flicks after all but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing nurse sherri was a poverty row production and it shows at times sets special effects etc still the film has heart mostly decent acting and direction and some genuine chills sam sherman also saw fit to use harry theme music for the late '50s early '60s television series one step beyond in this film which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere the dvd contains two significantly different cuts of the movie the early version features a lot of t a that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff as well as the theatrical trailer the tv spot and a great commentary by sherman does anybody know whatever happened to bill roy by the way next to john carradine he's the best actor i've ever seen in an al adamson film and he plays the cult leader like he means it
<START> it has past almost 25 years since i saw this movie i would consider this film as an all time classic in a drama category anthony queen gives one of the most wonderful performances ever in a matter of minutes he takes you from laugh to tears this movie represents a splendid picture of how humanity changed after the ii world war how a great part of that generation and the forthcoming lost its innocence it has taken me long time to find this film by its name the 25th hour this type of films are not a but they are for sure a treasure for some i am very surprise why this movie is not used for the media in a broaden way in order for more people to enjoy this picture
<START> i actually first watched one dark night in the theater wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper i loved it then i still love it the storyline revolves around two people first of all one woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death she then has feelings herself about the strange powers of her father even in his death the he's buried in plays host to the other main person a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her dare her to stay in the all night to join their group they go back in the night to scare her find scares for themselves the cast is led by meg tilly with supporting roles by adam west and one of my personal favorites elizabeth daily aka e g daily check this one out if you love 80's movies cheesy horror movies you won't be
<START> this movie is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of alan ladd this is good in one way because the movie has some interesting things to say but bad in another because everyone who watches it expecting that tough guy ladd is going to hoop through his usual paces is going to be mighty disappointed without fanfare or introduction ladd is suddenly introduced in the third reel true his role is a key one but it's small and likely to get lost in the shuffle there are many key roles in former newspaperman martin ambivalent screenplay which hits out at all political alliances and quite ruthlessly denigrates reform candidates it's the lovely and extremely talented joan woodbury who ties the various strands of the wide ranging story together unlike the usual hollywood production the plot actually proceeds in a series of jumps much like the films later turned out by the french new wave though easier to follow here especially if you are aware that the film's original title was paper bullets nonetheless some of the film's narrative and character switches are a little disconcerting particularly in the role played by jack larue who has wisely elected to act the part in a strangely non committal way one of jack's best acting jobs ever but no one is likely to notice alas
<START> i saw this movie on the base movie theater while in the air force so my affection for it might be influenced by the reaction of the raucous audience in attendance at the theater that night but i do think that this movie was one of the first popular kung fu movies and helped to begin the trend in the early 70's it's worth seeing
<START> this film makes about as much sense as an or a 'father knows best' episode an old copy of reader's digest circa 1962 would provide more insight into modern life or the relationship between a father and a daughter than this weird concoction br br i was surprised with diane keaton she appears to sleepwalk through the film given the film's title i realize that hers was a supporting role but even martin short managed a distinct supporting character br br i can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy but this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world i'm frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy
<START> although embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of it degenerates into a stereotypical frankenstein parable putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some realms man was not meant to enter or study br br scientist rock hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent babies from dying after success with a dog he immediately jumps to humans violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator his experiment works too well with some decidedly unpleasant side effects br br although barbara carrera is reasonably good in her role and some of the animal training is spectacular the film suffers from being too fantastical even though a message at the prologue assures viewers that this represents contemporary technology the scientific work depicted looks far fetched even for the twenty first century let alone the mid 1970s furthermore the scene where carrera is able to find a cure for the side effects of simply by typing a question into a computer is laughable
<START> this is both an entertaining and a touching version of the classic tale also quite intelligent not of the 'me tarzan you jane' school at all br br it's the famous story of a child reared to manhood in the jungle by apes a titled british couple the wife pregnant is stranded in the african wilds after a shipwreck after the parents' deaths the baby is raised in the jungle by apes twenty years later this young man i e tarzan rescues a wounded belgian explorer nursing him back to health the belgian discovers evidence that his rescuer is the young lord greystoke and returns him to his rightful estate in scotland where he must adjust to civilized society br br the movie is sort of divided into two parts in the first half we see tarzan in his jungle environment not being an expert i am unaware as to the realism of its depiction of ape community life but it is certainly entertaining for me the more moving section is the second half when tarzan must meet his real family develop language skills and adjust to aristocratic british society all the while wooing jane andie macdowell he is portrayed as a 'noble savage' whether in the wild or in elegant edwardian parlors by contrast the upper crust is depicted as often far more barbaric than the jungle tarzan left br br christopher lambert is fantastic in his sympathetic portrayal of tarzan in both the jungle and civilized environments he conveys a real sense of his confusion and conflict torn as he is between the two very different worlds his original ape family and his new human one sir ralph richardson one of the old british legends is brilliant as always in the role of tarzan's grandfather the sixth earl of greystoke br br the film focuses more on tarzan's struggles in adapting to civilization and his inner conflict than on his jungle exploits this unusual take on the old classic makes it both the typical dramatic adventure but also above all a moving personal story i wasn't surprised to note here that its director is the same individual hugh hudson who also directed chariots of fire another brilliant movie
<START> this movie is based on the true story of iowa housewife lucille fray who got breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child realizing that the state would take the children away from her ineffectual alcoholic husband she devoted the last year of her life traveling around the state to find new homes for each of the children a terrific script which still holds up 20 years after it was first made the grown children many of whom had not seen each other since their mother died in the late 50's were reunited on that's incredible prior to the film's airing in 1983 barbara stanwyck won the emmy for best actress in a tv movie or mini series but during her acceptance speech she went out of her way to single ann margret out for her moving performance
<START> i've been waiting years for the dead to come out on video having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays it takes place on the feast of the epiphany twelfth night and is a simple poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three dublin women central to the story is a fairly loveless couple a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife but feels incapable all of the performances are stunning and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully of course its source material is james joyce's short story of the same title and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact john huston's long career as one of hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film which was scripted by his son tony huston stars his daughter anjelica huston and is dedicated to his wife thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate subtle yet incredibly moving holiday film this is a true gem
<START> victor silent film masterpiece the phantom carriage has recently been released on dvd with a new soundtrack recorded by the duo comprising american guitarist stephen and austrian laptop artist peter has conjured an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original film footage from 1921 an ominous banging sound introduces each act and a medley of drones guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds br br as impressive as the new soundtrack is the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale according to this tale the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on new year's eve is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous phantom carriage collecting the souls of the dead this is the fate of the anti hero of the film david holm who is moved to painful scrutiny of his life following his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the carriage br br this film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a fitting label the real horror here resides not in the supernatural elements but rather in the depiction of human suffering at the hands of others gives a remarkable performance as the drunken spiteful and menacing holm in life and the wretched frightened holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds br br striking imagery abounds throughout the phantom carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue the ill onset of midnight is powerfully illustrated through the image of a clock face hovering alone in the darkening night sky like a second moon equally impressively the dead are depicted through pioneering semi transparent imagery and the scenes of the phantom carriage riding over land and sea remain chilling to watch br br film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films of all time and the new soundtrack by is a superb accentuation of its themes this is a must see
<START> i recently started to watch this show in syndication and find it a bit hit and miss some episodes are silly doug is upset about some trivial juvenile thing and acts stupid etc br br still others are quite amusing and sometimes touching these include those episodes that face up to the complexities of the characters for instance the juvenile overweight amiable guy marries sexy wife theme is found in several sitcoms carrie also has something about her looks wise not just a run of the mill sexy girl but carrie has an edge she might be nice on the eyes but has a few too many personality traits not too far different than her father br br and she readily admits to it for instance one episode revolves at her lack of desire to be nice to co workers i personally find her b ness sexy but you have to be the right sort of person to be able to live with that amiable doug is a good match and deep down see likes the simple things too maybe not as much as doug whose nirvana is watching tv and eating a big snack next to his big screen t v but no culture gal she this lack of an sensitive side is one reason the two don't have children br br of course the simple pleasures of a guy is nothing to sneer at either and adds to the charm of the show they live an ordinary working class sort of life in queens it is realistic in that sense and overall amusing and pleasant sitcom fare esp if you just want to relax it gets a little tired at the end so it's probably good it is ending it had a good run see also becker
<START> these cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny and fun puns the first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates alka fizz prison no noose is good noose inside the prison the first sign we see is welcome have a seat they then show an electric chair br br corny gives way to clever however as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars with pen in hand he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it in no time he has criss crossed the united states zipped up through canada and is in the northern part of that country it's there we see the canadian royal mounted police and of course our hero droopy known here as sgt he has the assignment of catching the at large criminal from alka fizz so with his trusty little blue horse he goes out in the heavy snow to track down the wanted wolf br br from that point we get the normal story droopy always being a step ahead of the wolf no matter what the latter does and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny sight gags droopy even pops out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain there is nowhere the wolf can go or do plastic surgery to escape the intrepid sgt nobody by the way in the history of cartoons perhaps has more exaggerated reactions either than this wolf each time he sees his nemesis his screams facial and body stretched out in horror each time is a big part of the sight gags br br you'd think this one joke cartoon would get monotonous but it doesn't it's more good stuff from tex avery and the gang just one of 24 cartoons in the complete theatrical collection dvd with wonderful looking restored visuals
<START> muscular unpleasantly thin females in swimsuits lots of beer drinking yet it's too long to be a beer commercial oh okay there's some plot about a big shark like monster that's killing people and stuff but it's nothing you haven't seen before
<START> silver city 2 outta 5 stars as a huge fan of john work for many years now i feel safe in saying that this is the worst movie he has ever done that said the movie isn't exactly terrible just very uninspired sayles throws in familiar elements from his previous movies corrupt politics illegal immigration the selling out of youthful ideals but fails to bring them together in any new or meaningful way even the dialogue usually strong point is disappointing this time around sounding clichÃ©d and forced in almost every scene the movie looks and sounds like episodes from a tv series that didn't make it past its third episode there are tons of big stars on hand and they try their best to make their bit parts come alive but the material just isn't there this time around while filming a campaign spot a governor hopeful a poor and obvious george w bush stand in fishes a dead body out of a lake an investigator is hired to try and warn away people who may have deliberately set this up to discredit the candidate but he soon finds out that there are deeper and darker and more clichÃ©d secrets to be discovered sayles has made similarly themed movies so much better in the past lone star matewan return of the secaucus seven men with guns it's a shame that he went to the well one time too many and came up with tainted water one good line delivered by richard dreyfuss danny you're a loser that's already been established beyond doubt so just try and be a good one okay
