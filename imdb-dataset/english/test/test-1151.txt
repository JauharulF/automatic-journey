<START> i saw this film knowing absolutely nothing about both it and its stars chris farley and david spade and i have to say that this film is a comic classic it is so stupid at times that it can only be hilarious farley is brilliant as the bumbling idiot who takes to the road with his dad's right hand man the equally excellent spade to find the funding to save the families business relax put your brain on auto pilot and soak up the fun a great supporting cast features film favourites such as brian dennehy cocoon rob lowe wayne's world and bo derek 10 highly recommended for a good laugh
<START> is a pretty funny episode of south park it spoofs al gore and his speeches on global warming only replacing global warming with a fictional monster who has parts of a man a bear and a pig he tells the boys about it in a school assembly and stan feels sorry for him so he and the boys decide to hang out with him gore eventually gets them trapped in a rock cave where he believes to be and they are stuck for days meanwhile cartman finds treasure but wants to keep it all to himself is a good spoof on global warming and overall a funny south park episode br br 8 10
<START> wwii veterans return home and find it hard to adjust to civilian life this superb drama is expertly directed by wyler and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer despite its near three hour length it does not drag for a minute the script by sherwood features very human characters and great dialog andrews has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet also good are wright as a love sick young woman mayo as andrews' trampy wife and real life veteran russell as a man who lost both his hands however top honors go to march and loy as a long married couple facing challenges while getting reacquainted with each other
<START> yes a real stinker i saw this movie on the advice of my sweet friends who told me that this is a great psychological movie this film makes every effort not to be understandable i was aware that i was in for a stinker after seeing the first 20 minutes i waited since i expected to see something valuable and most important of all i paid for this film the wait was unbearable after seeing the film i talked with my friends and learned that in the intellectual environments they call themselves under this title of turkey this movie had recognised as a masterpiece yes a masterpiece but in the category of stinkers i think that a movie must be self explanatory this film is just the opposite keep away from this thing which calls itself a movie burn your money instead of paying for this phenomenon rate 1 out of 10
<START> i watched this movie again yesterday with a 20 year old intern from my office ok it was the quiet day after thanksgiving and we both loved it i love the unique plot david duchovny david allen greer and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door isn't part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love dies br br i also love the old folks at the restaurant they remind me of some of the older people around southern new england where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion and i love the wedding at the end br br minnie driver is great in this movie and bonnie hunt should have won an award for everything br br bonnie make more movies
<START> this short was nominated for an academy award losing to anna and bella not since doctor strangelove has nuclear war been so hilarious takes a situation and turns it on its ear and then gives it a spin for good measure visual gags abound in work and i always see something i missed before every time i watch this on the world's greatest animation well worth seeing for many other shorts recommended
<START> i like and viva la bam so i couldn't resist this when i saw it for Â£1 99 in it is bam debut scripted film penned by himself and brandon and stars the entire crew ryan dunn himself rake don vito etc etc brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction which is one of the film's greatest merits its quite in its colour style but also shows progression br br basically it follows very loosely ryan dunn's break up with girlfriend played by played by bam named after by any chance and falcone play his best mates who reek havoc by doing various stunts br br its a bit like the films but with a linear storyline which is very basic indeed and poor acting its strange the usually super gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say next br br the acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part but the second half of the film is much better than the first 90 mins is a stretch for the flick though and there are a number of redeeming factors such as tony hawk's cameo sub plots such as 'the invention awards' and 'the diamond the soundtrack is also very strong its not all and him in fact mc's steal the film in terms of its use of music in the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real especially since don vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part and he seems to steal every scene he is in br br the film will appeal to those who like the antics but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line bullshit oh and will someone tell bam that skating montages especially in films is sooo 1998 br br however the best part of the package on the dvd is not the film but the 40 mins 'making of' doc br br the last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with and the crew's real feelings towards each other amazing candidly as usual bam comes across as a bit of a dick especially towards drink problem and ryan dunn comes across as a really nice down to earth guy the last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend who is an infrequent member trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the household with the crew and a caring side of gang ape and ryan really comes across a startling gem in an otherwise dull dvd br br for Â£1 99 i'm very although i hope bam stays to the improvised and short skits from now on
<START> this movie is an abortive stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra bad movie it fails at even this since there's way too much plot and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore seriously the puppets are sweet and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good the performances are c grade at best and lame throughout with special props to the spec ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre east coast dialect that was almost impossible to decipher not that you really care what he says as only the curse words are distinct cinematographically it's non offensive pretty much what you'd expect from low rent straight to video offal just like the script the fact that new concorde used footage from the carnosaur films is offensive and quite confusing for shame new concorde for shame carnosaur is one of my favorite terrible movies and they somehow screwed it up and made it nigh unwatchable see the carnosaur films if you want to see shoestring dinosaur mayhem br br i give it one star because i am so fond of the movies it steals from and also because the scale doesn't have a zero
<START> this is a movie you'll either love or hate i loved it if you are looking for suspense great special effects action sophistication cynicism etc you won't find it in this movie it is a feel good movie sentimental positive uplifting the heroes of the movie are coach jones played by ed harris a man of strength and integrity and radio cuba gooding jr a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world i guess i didn't find this movie to be sentimental hogwash as so many did because it felt very real to me i know people like these i've seen jocks who think it's fun to pick on the vulnerable i've seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable i've seen people who think high school football is serious business i've seen people who know what really is important in life any of these people could have been people i knew i did laugh i did cry i left the movie feeling good remembering that there are people like coach jones and radio in my world if there aren't people like them in yours you might not like the movie if you don't like a movie that shows the better side of human nature you'll hate it
<START> very good film very good documentary br br very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted narcissistic heartless their one eyed parents community and environment raised them as br br i tip my lid to pat can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation we need his integrity endurance intelligence clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business br br all the animals come out at night whores skunk pussies queens fairies junkies sick venal someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets pat should be the first drops of that real rain the people who control this earth are animals they need to be drowned br br i'm just in shock walking the night is scary business the inhuman howling and cackling is of detectives in murder on a sunday morning in pat blazing spotlight they look horribly caught horribly guilty and ready for a just and horrible drowning br br it is exceptionally satisfying in a world in which the punters play a rigged game to see justice done and to see every narcissistic felon drown like the pathetic human rats they are br br how does it feel you abominable snaky fingers of the law how does it feel to have your rigged prosecution your rigged confession your rigged detective work found out for what it really was how does it feel br br i hope it twists like a knife you miserable one eyed nothings
<START> it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen and who will die it is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death br br this movie like the others of that era contrives to bring this about and the viewer knows this there is no mystery or suspense the people squabble but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time it is laughable br br the five people happen upon two savage young characters and go nuts everyone is nuts so that the director writer team can justify their nazi propaganda br br for some reason the guy is attracted to the blonde who is really not much to look at and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over one must remember that in the seventies movies were meant to appeal to women and not men br br totally crap and totally depressing
<START> here's another antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or dvd i saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time even in metropolitan movie capital l a for a couple of weeks and then disappeared art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory where older favorites like antonioni and resnais are only welcome as occasional br br at first i was disappointed thought the pace to be unbearably boring and that the man had lost a chance for years antonioni had found it difficult to find financing at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon but knowing antonioni for what he was and how i had at first reacted to blow up and the passenger i refused to pass judgment until i had seen the film again i went back the next day and i should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in making me aware of things i had thought about and lost track of throughout my life driving home in a contemporary setting points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in ' forming an environment of subtle moods so and fascinatingly alienated in tone and quite comedic actually that i couldn't get enough the scene with malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach with the weather so beautifully silver and the u2 track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm had been my favorite it still was but now the whole film was just as great what a strange phenomenon the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which antonioni's eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate the odd thing is though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous sophie and plently of other international stars to distract you this film is unmistakably antonioni's to its core but you will not sense to what a profound extent until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm for example it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor something i did not notice at first but was turned on to by another critic and noticed to much delight on further viewings 4 before they pulled it and would've gone back for more if this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it i have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of antonioni's '60s films but the '60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed dvd version if and when it's released i urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see 'beyond the and add a piece of magic to the tragic
<START> great story great music a heartwarming love story that's beautiful to watch and delightful to listen to too bad there is no soundtrack cd
<START> though not hal hartley's best work my personal favorite is surviving desire there is still much to like about this movie especially for fans of hartley's dialogues even to audiences new to hartley i would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric dogma this movie is more intelligent truer to its source material the bible and more fun than any of the other pre millennium apocalypse movies br br this movie is actually part of the french 2000 as seen by 2000 par vu series as such it is perhaps even a lower budget film than hartley's other works while the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurry jittery effect i'd be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again especially at the beginning it almost makes the movie unwatchable but overlook this flaw and you'll be treated to a fine film especially notable is played by p j harvey relating how jesus saved her from being stoned to death a short scene i found surprisingly moving despite the fact that it was not mary magdalene that this happened to the woman in the bible was unnamed br br
<START> tom gilson was my brother so i went to see the movie and i never looked at it again in all these years sorry it was bad i'm told i have to write 10 lines so i'll put a little trivia in tom and tuesday weld were to be introduced in this picture and tom was told to take tuesday to the premiere but tom said no he was going with joan collins and he did and because he did only tuesday weld was introduced i found this very funny back then and still do the movie while the concept was a funny one and the actors in it were impressive but some how it just did'nt come out funny the continuity was abstract at best it was like i was watching 2 different movies at the same time each running into the other sorry bob gilson
