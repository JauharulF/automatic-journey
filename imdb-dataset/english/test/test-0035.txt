<START> big fat liar comes as a welcome shallow but welcome breath of fresh air after one too many films featuring bathrooms bodily fluids pets on acid jokes and crotch gags after all see spot run max big move and snow dogs had signaled the degenerative spiral of kiddie movie making worse is the realization that the young audience would later be satiated by the offerings of not another teen movie and slackers written by nickelodeon producers dan schneider and brian robbins who coincidentally co starred on the '80s sitcom head of the class the film stars frankie as jason who's always ready with a good lie to get out of scrapes where's the english paper dad choked on a swedish meatball his teacher sandra oh issues an ultimatum turn in the paper by the end of the day or take summer school jason whips out a story called big fat liar and is struck en route to school by a limousine carrying insensitive hollywood producer marty wolf paul giamatti wolf gives him a ride but jason leaves his paper behind no one will hear the truth this time and dad tells him he's lost his trust br br months later jason and best friend amanda bynes see a movie preview for big fat liar and head off to los angeles to wreak havoc on wolf's life all to get a confession that he stole jason's paper to make the film they even gain the sympathy of some of wolf's abused employees including his assistant amanda detmer former chauffeur donald faison movie star white playing himself and stunt coordinator a much aged lee majors br br because big fat liar is without the edge that his sitcom malcolm in the middle is known for is easy to root for but doesn't have much to work with likewise for bynes who headlines her own tracey ullman like sketch show on nickelodeon all the hamminess is given to giamatti whose eyes bulge and cheeks wiggle with every sneering insult br br the film gets snaps just by attempting the high road and should be enjoyed by its target audience especially since most of the high jinks occur on the universal studios lot but here's one head scratcher the message is that it pays to tell the truth but didn't we just see jason getting to his payback by telling white lies throughout the film well at least there's no poop
<START> simply delightful claymation feature from nick park and company spoofing such film greats as king kong and the wolf man has wallace and gromit as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their village a giant were rabbit is feasting lavishly on the vegetable crops of the citizens what makes this even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to commence and the citizens have all prepared dutifully to win the top of prize what makes the situation even worse is wallace is the reason behind the whole vegetable eating rampage he was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured rabbits into disliking vegetable crops what occurs is catastrophic as some sort of hybrid were rabbit is created in the process and it has more to do with wallace than he could ever imagine it'll be up to his loyal and startlingly intelligent and fast thinking dog gromit to save the day br br this is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other oscar winning claymation features starring wallace and gromit seeing good ole fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the cgi boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product here we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation not to mention gut busting sight gags
<START> watching cold mountain gave me the impression that its director anthony was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his' that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable the english patient from 1996 comparing the two movies the premise is quite similar we have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each other's arms again the primary plot differences are that nicole kidman's character is not married jude law's is a deserter and the conflict is the american civil war br br cold mountain is story wise more watered down and mellow than say the english patient and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior turbulence causing a problem it is a shorter film which is a plus for people with less patience however it's not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as the english patient my only big complaint about cold mountain is astonishingly the love affair between the characters of jude law and ada monroe nicole kidman amazingly their love was the least interesting thing in the picture they don't have a real relationship we don't feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional i was more fascinated by the friendship between nicole kidman and oscar winner renee and also jude law's travels across country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers if had strengthened the importance of the love story then he would have had i feel a better picture br br of course the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting the civil war sequences are absolutely great they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing the re enactment of the petersburg campaign in which tons of explosives was detonated from underground and then followed by a hand to hand battle is horrifying does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner and he's not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes there are moments where women as well as men are killed oftentimes by crossfire and there's more to it just the sound design of the movie generates tension there's a scene where and another deserter make themselves a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow we don't see the slicing but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickening br br lastly i must congratulate the cast for the performances jude law was terrific in the movie and deserved the academy award nomination he received i feel that nicole kidman deserved one as well even though her character was a bit shallow renee had the most personality and screen stealing atmosphere and then there's just the bit parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in america's past br br maybe cold mountain would have been better as a war picture but it most certainly would have been spectacular like the english patient if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director anthony as it is it's a most enjoyable picture i wasn't bored by it and i recommend it i just say that its love story though a central plot point is a little more mellow than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked
<START> i saw this movie as part of the midnite madness at set in 18th century england the plot covers the life of arthur blake from his first outing as an apprentice grave robber to his final confession on the eve of his execution br br the plot moves along via a series of misadventures involving arthur and his partner encountering various unsavory characters and bizarre situations br br the first thing that strikes you about this movie is how accurately they managed to capture the look of the hammer period horrors the atmosphere is set with lots of fog laden graveyards rowdy tavern scenes and excellent set costume design br br for a movie titled i sell the dead i was expecting the emphasis to be mostly on horror Â don't get me wrong there are some jumpy moments and gore but the tone is very much comedic driven by the situations the characters get themselves into and their dialog the closest comparison to the scenes between the two leads larry fessenden and dominic monaghan is the character interaction seen in the classic english comedies only fools and horses the two ronnies and morecambe and wise br br the acting is strong and the casting of very familiar faces in ron perlman and angus scrimm lift the movie above many of the others on view in br br overall the movie offers something very different to the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face
<START> it was libby talking to desmond in the flashback and if anyone is confused about her past like how did she end up in the same hospital hurley was in then you should know that libby dying in season 2 the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her br br btw great episode it had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions like what happened to eko and lock and what about the four toe statue br br i cannot wait till season 3 lost just rules i hope all the unanswered questions will be answered i loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed desmond did it when he did not manage to type in the numbers in time 4 8 15 16 23 42
<START> i really enjoyed this movie for what it is a funny little film that doesn't take itself too seriously plot summaries are available everywhere so i won't go into details michael isn't about a complex plot anyway it just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip br br john travolta's performance as a chain smoking lady loving bar brawling pie eating angel is just perfect and who doesn't love sparky br br watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time highly recommended
<START> okay okay i must admit i do somewhat like peter and i'll admit this is not the best ghoulies sequel i mean yeah it had its flaws such as no ghoulies themselves but the two ghoulies that come to earth were really funny i guess they were called dark and lite i enjoyed the plot of the movie and even at the end of the movie both ghoulies implied that there would be a sequel still waiting lol peter reprised his role as jonathan graves this time playing a detective how cute ghoulies iv may not be scary or suspenseful but it is definitely funny i thought i would comment on this movie and just say it's not that bad it is worth watching even though the ghoulies aren't in it
<START> well every scene so perfectly presented never before had i seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene br br well while i was watching this movie i remembered watching is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch these movies are both based on a same plot line but both of them are perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own br br red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and s and i am still thinking about it br br the story is great and the ending is a bit funny i was laughing in the end scene well funny how this three movie red white and blue are connected br br all in all a great work of art a work of a br br 10 10
<START> this wonderful 3 part bbc production is one of the sweetest love stories that i have seen in a while the actresses display a very high level of talent especially rachael stirling as nan she is funny seductive and cute the love making scenes and the close up kisses are very erotic regardless of one's sexual preference br br the characters are well defined and very believable i guess this is a by product of a good adaptation from a well written novel br br a truly remarkable well paced drama that picks up speed quickly after a couple of boring but necessary scenes in the beginning br br my vote 9 10
<START> i think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet paper no respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie for example the names of some serbian terrorists that i remember are and leo what kind of names are that certainly not serbian by the way what a name i laughed for days thinking about it probably an implication on karadzic and secondly there have never been any cases of terrorism done by serbians a journalist like the main character ought to have known that thirdly the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even serbs nor do they speak serbo croatian all this aside this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper thin and full of holes at times it makes no sense whatsoever
<START> cannibalism a pair of cinematic references to delicatessen not only in plot but in style cannibalism a pair of references to the historic case of the uruguayan rugby players that survived in the by eating the dead members of their flight to chile cannibalism only an excuse the movie uses to delve into the extremes men are willing to go to defeat isolation and obtain social acceptance br br the script is extremely creative and hopefully is going to leave the viewer laughing and wondering
<START> i may differ from many people on this board but i enjoy watching mind of mencia the reason i like mind of mencia is the host is not afraid to speak his mind or exploit stereotypes carlos mencia does what we all do with our friends but are unwilling to admit and then some br br mencia has no problem doing jokes about any race religion sex or orientation while he gets a lot of flack for this it is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times mencia does not care if he offends anyone but he is not a racist and even does jokes about his own race br br the typical format for the mind of mencia goes like this there will be an open skit making fun of a person or recent event mencia then comes out and does a 5 or 6 minute stand up where he talks about various issues the show then has 2 separate skits divided by commercials in these skits mencia does a variety of things such as making fun of people giving his personal opinions with a funny twist or simply doing parodies of people events or movies at the end of the show mencia comes out for a minute with either one final skit or something else to say br br people criticize mencia for exploiting stereotypes and say his statements are overly offensive carlos only does what everyone else thinks of certain races but are afraid to say as for mencia being offensive he is only speaking his mind i find nothing wrong with that br br the show is not perfect the skits can be not put together the best and sometimes mencia does go over the line in his jokes for the most part however it is a show where the comedian says what is on his mind no matter what the consequences and presents in in a humorous matter so if you aren't afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone speak his mind and often say what you have wanted to say then watch mind of mencia however if you are easily offended you should not watch this show because you will be offended or worse yet you might even laugh
<START> i began watching this movie on t v some weeks ago but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so at the start the person on the witness protection scheme located in an isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about his exterior placed guards and then asks the guard inside the house whether he can make a telephone call only to discover the line has been cut br br shortly afterwards roy scheider as one of the assassins turns up and duly executes the witness and his wife upon which the roy scheider character duly picks up the wall telephone in the kitchen a number and then speaks it is done that was it for me
<START> mr seagal has apparantly lowered his already low standards even more and has now outdone himself in making bad movies the foreigner has no substance what so ever in the script it's director has made an even worse job and the music and score is so cheezy and malplaced that you just don't know whether to laugh or cry already 10 minutes into the movie you just want to turn it off however considering steven seagal's past movies you think 'hey there might be some cool action sequences at least worth watching ' you are wrong it only gets worse as the movie progresses everyone with a few exceptions seem to kill every person that they talk to good or bad innocent or not the only good thing with the movie is that it that it has an end and that it has a rather short running time summing the movie up in two words stay away
<START> i left the theater and i was only 10 years old that's how bad it sucked the plot was horrid and the acting was worse leslie nielson should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie i was only 10 years old when i went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young innocent age i did not laugh once at the movie we me and my friend still laugh about how bad the movie was we ended up going into the 'r' movie my parents were in bottom line this flick was bad mr magoo more like mr ma who this movie could have scarred me for life had i watched the popular cartoon on television as a child but luckily i had never seen it so i was spared the agony but i will never get back those precious minutes of my life that i wasted
