<START> you may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to the stepford but this is an absolute classic much scarier in premise than the first and very entertaining it only got a video release here in the uk but should be released worldwide for everyone to enjoy
<START> heaven can wait is a crushing bore and a candy coated misogynist lie i can't imagine anyone but film students sitting through it today don ameche is in almost every scene and while he has a mellifluous voice that no doubt contributed to his successful career in radio he doesn't have the charisma to carry this film ameche plays henry a womanizer lubitsch wants to make henry's sexual adorable and amusing and so he directs ameche to play the part as blandly as possible the combination of ameche's lack of charisma and lubitsch's insistence on blandness results in a lead character who is both deadly dull and completely icky you wouldn't want to spend any time with this man he'd put you to sleep you wouldn't leave him alone with your daughter no matter her age something creepy would happen br br the movie's look is quite boring scene after scene consists of static overly lighted style shots of fastidiously dressed gilded age stuffed shirts and lounging in excessively busy victorian parlors there's so many and frills and so much and sky blue and pink you need dramamine br br this movie hates women as much as hardcore porn but it presents that hatred with a candy coating and a sweet little bow on top the contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is sickening in one of the movie's most hateful scenes an elderly woman is sent to hell because she's not physically attractive
<START> i recently saw this movie for the first time i enjoyed it so much that i went right out and bought the dvd this movie is pure genius and only gets funnier with each viewing anyone can write jokes or funny dialog and have actors memorize them but the basis of this movie is improve how do they do it thank you christopher guest
<START> are pretty good at making me laugh at the drab nothingness of my soulless life huh br br the film making here was incredibly meticulous every piece of framing every deadpan stare every element of the colour palette every snippet of muzak or of those street cleaners was there to hammer home this world's calm emptiness br br in fact i think i might have found the general sense of emptiness overbearing had its absurdity not been genuinely funny and relatable like when andreas is telling his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy is smiling and halfway out the door it's a sort of sad but true reflection of working with people spending 7 8 hours a day with them seeing more of them than the folk you love but ultimately knowing deep down they don't give a damn about your troubles and you the same br br this might have been a film the had made had they been born in oslo and not minnesota i think their humour is more aggressive and more wrapped up in cinema's past but they have the same mastery of technique and their films have the same underlying sense that life is pretty inconsequential br br i'll stop before i talk myself into taking a bus into the wintry wilderness
<START> maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70's there's an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more awkward and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras now br br the real curio here and really the only reason to watch this movie is the appearance of kristine debell as alice she was a ford model and it shows she's got classic wasp ish good looks like a really cute ivy league sorority girl so what the hell is she doing in this cheap cheesy skin flick from my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie which might explain it and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part when she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she's flippin' julie andrews or something i just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gonna be her big break or something instead of the near career killer that it was anyway she is damn cute and you kind of can't believe she would even get naked on screen much less do a masturbation scene a couple of oral sex scenes with men and women and then do the real deal as a climax to the film it is also definitely not a body double at all that is our little kristine taking one for the team or for the greater glory of showbiz or something it's pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating ahem but in a way i kinda wish she hadn't done it that was a very pretty talented young girl getting some really bad advice br br anyway my guess is that kristine debell wherever she is has long long since wished this movie would go away she was very cute and appealing in meatballs almost impossible to believe this is the same girl but it is
<START> just awful it's almost unbelievable that with characters and situations provided by dashiell hammett such a plodding passionless mishmash could result but that's television for you filler between commercials the first warning signal sounds from the of the period re creation which screams 1928 in banner type and touring cars fedoras and and speakeasy jazz jarringly played with all the attention paid to pointless arty detail the important matters get ignored br br like narrative clarity or plausibility or competent writing and acting the plot sets one of hammett's operatives hamilton nash so whether he's called ham or nash we think of hammett or dash investigating a bogus diamond theft thus is introduced the young woman who supposedly carries the curse the charmless and talentless nancy addison who went back to soaps where she belonged she belongs to a crackpot religious cult led by jean simmons and seems addicted to drugs as well there's also a mysterious drug which seeps into rooms br br but enough the writing is never more pedestrian than when it reaches for the poetic or high flown and the cast parrots it the only way they know how by grotesquely overacting simmons gets treated like minor royalty from old hollywood but the grande dame treatment doesn't wash hector elizondo for some reason enjoys second billing after coburn for a dispensable part other familiar faces drift through doing little good for their resumes br br the actors aren't even photographed to look good jason miller is an especial fright but extreme close ups of coburn are pitiless too coburn probably copped this role because with mustache he bears a strong resemblance to hammett he needed more guidance than that nobody has given him the vaguest hint as to how to play his character or of the story's tone or of how the different strands of the plot mesh together they don't at least not in this telling so he flashes his big cat grin whether called for or not br br the curse is available on videotape in a variety of lengths for those foolhardy enough to see for themselves the shortest is the kindest cut of all
<START> this is one of the few movies maybe the only that truly haunted me for years it was the first i had ever seen people tortured so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming etc it was brutal the worst thing i had ever seen on film br br dr clement played by joseph mayer is still one of the most evil characters i've ever seen on film and i've viewed thousands he was so sadistic that i would never watch this movie again nor would i recommend it he makes hannibal lecter look like mr rogers if seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun then stay away from this film br br i know there are a lot of sick people out there many of them professional film critics who probably enjoyed this sordid sick story it's a b movie anyway with stupid dialog and some wooden acting by charles bronson this is not one of his better efforts even if it was there so many horrendous scenes in here you wouldn't want to watch trust me on this one
<START> 'never been is a real feel good film if you haven't seen it yet then rent it out i am going to buy it when its released because i loved it drew barrymore is excellent again she plays her part well i felt i could relate to this film because of the school days i had were just as bad i thought the plot was well written there was comedy and romance which are the type of films i love i loved the ending because even though you know what's going to happen it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting anticipating
<START> for a series that was inspired by kolchak it's ironic that the x files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it's ass 3 has always puzzled me and at the risk of sounding like the dreadful hans keller i've often wondered if i'm missing the point the story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea this incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it i know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to by teenage vampires who'll drink my blood while listening to busted but that's a risk i'm willing to take i've always been a werewolf man myself
<START> personally i've watched it because of lea thompson's appearance and i didn't really expect to enjoy the movie as such but surprisingly i kept watching it until the end br br let's face it it just one of the saga like stories and isn't particularly original or entertaining but strangely it just keeps you by the tv my opinion about will of their own would be much better if there wouldn't be one point that i just don't get br br there is lovely and really touchy scene in which lea thompson's character is running on the street holding baby in her arms the snow is falling she is cold scared and has no place to stay she doesn't know what to do next and then about 10 12 years later when things are better for her she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about br br i just don't get it i don't see how is it possible that she would do such thing it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival after this character flip i just couldn't enjoy rest of the movie
<START> this film is not your typical hollywood fare though the pickings are so bad i often tend to stay away from movies rather than be disappointed however this little low budget gem is thoroughly loveable and enjoyable and definitely a keeper the actors are as varied as the characters they portray the buffalo setting is charming what a pretty city and the story sparkles the lack of gratuitous violence sex and the f word doesn't detract in the least take the kids take grandma take a break from hollywood i give it an 11 out of 10
<START> when a bbc murder thriller is this rife with heterosexual dysfunction you know who the killer must be the homosexual br br who murdered the sexy blonde teenager who's also a pathological liar on her way home from school let's see could it be the mother who against all common sense is letting her teenaged son make visits to his serial killer father behind bars could it be the moody son who's impressed by his dad's no nonsense attitude about women could it be the serial killer himself who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars a la hannibal lecter could it be mom's boyfriend a teacher at the school whose affair with an ex student led to his wife's suicide or could it be boyfriend's daughter who goes blabbing everyone's secrets at school causing untold misery no it's none of these likely suspects it's the homosexual br br the only mystery for the viewer is guessing who the homosexual is of course it could be anybody since the only characteristics of the homosexual are shameful secrecy and a propensity to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the normal folks the homosexual is the invisible root cause of society's ills only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family come back together and things can return to normal whatever that is br br as for the cast both redgrave and robson green are now officially past their sell by dates the world could get by marvelously without ever seeing either on screen again but as long as the bbc has roles for the aggrieved woman and the misunderstood man i suppose they'll keep coming back in movies like this one
<START> this is truly a kung fu classic this film appears to have influenced martial arts films for decades the spanish guitar background music the competing schools the impossibly high leaps onto the edges of rooftops catching thrown spears cheating in tournaments the secret training for an exotic karate technique themes of patience and perseverance and more were copied by many later films such as the karate kid 1984 hero 2002 kill bill volume 2 2004 and kung fu hustle 2004 br br i feel lucky to have first seen this film in 1972 shortly after it was released just before kung fu films became mainstream and before bruce lee became a household name i saw it with two buddies of mine in a downtown san diego theater frequented by sailors and although the scenes of the glowing red hands and gouged eyeballs got some laughs clearly the audience was getting into it as was our little group it was a very memorable movie for me decades later i could still recall several specific scenes even after i had forgotten the film title this film is extra special to me now because one of those two buddies with whom i first saw it sailor kenneth lee hines of the kitty hawk has since passed away so this film serves as a memento of that day together before we took judo and karate lessons in subsequent years br br relative to kung fu films i'd rate this film as 10 10 but since i have to keep the larger film audience in mind i'll more objectively rate it as 8 10 due to obvious technical flaws i just recommend that neophyte viewers consider those technical flaws to be proof of its vintage nature and of its authenticity and then merrily proceed to enjoy its testosterone charged mayhem
<START> what starts off fairly well and quite disturbing quickly sinks into an annoying mess br br dee snider of twisted sister infamy apparently penned the screenplay from his own idea and while the idea of a cyber stalking pierce freak has potential they really blow it here on uneven pacing bad dialogue and one of the greatest non endings you'll ever see despite some lifeless performances the director manages a genuinely creepy first reel this really looks like it's going to be a good low budget effort br br no such luck the plot goes all over the map and character relentlessly spits out tiresome psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to pass for meaningful dialogue worse the supporting cast barely registers and the only halfway believable dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the internet br br what a waste of a great idea oh and there is a new twisted sister song if you care
<START> this is one of my favorite horror films of all time and i used to think it never really got its due that is until i read the glowing reviews here it seems many feel the same as i did when i first saw it br br it's a damn creepy film and i've spent most of my life watching creepy films i've always found dolls mannequins and such damn creepy check out the dolls in beyond the door and of course the great trilogy of terror and what about the magnificent twilight zone episode living doll hell dolls are creepy and tourist trap has some moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck all aided by an excellent soundtrack that just makes connors' performance even more heart pounding br br i remember seeing the trailer to this film on late night tv and thing wow i gotta see that it was memorable and it's one of the only trailers i remember seeing as a kid that creeped me out took me years to see it but it was a treat br br stephen king also mentions this film in his danse macabre book and gives it a glowing recommendation pretty good company br br this film will always be high on my list of must sees it's a real solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves place alongside the best of the 70s
