<START> i was very interested in seeing this movie despite the article i read about the director in magazine i don't judge movies by what the director may or may not have done this debut feature was very difficult to watch i found the split screens to be a distraction to the drama in the film some of the supporting characters gave bad performances and the film to be a copy of several other films i have seen there really wasn't anything fresh about this
<START> miscast badly directed and atrociously written this is watchable if you have an hour or two to kill or are suffering from insomnia but only just robert carlyle fully realises his potential as an actor of supreme mediocrity with only one expression to his repertoire that of a chronically constipated football hooligan nursing a crippling inferiority complex which he manages at times to alter slightly by flaring his nostrils and baring a row of skewed yellow teeth this to indicate anger tenderness grief surprise horror hilarity compassion etc in his role as the best marine engineer in the uk and son of a university professor he is about as convincing as my cat tom equally miscast slurring and every line appears permanently soused to the eyeballs and would seem no more able to tell a flood from a puddle of his own urine if he were standing in it all in all another silly attempt on the part of the british to imitate hollywood pulp at its most rubbishy the dialogue is a series of badly delivered clichÃ©s the action is disjointed the plot is pointless and amputated and the characters if you can call them that do not even make it into the basic two dimensional sphere of their american counterparts
<START> on the whole one wishes this was a better film but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while peck made this film during the same period that he made the gunfighter before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor a pity he was a fine actor perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable and to do them extremely well the character he plays here is driven and when necessary ruthless given the mission the character has been assigned and the men with which to do it those characteristics are essential br br without being a spoiler think of this film as an early grittier example of the dirty dozen genre br br the dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling it contains good work by all the character actors and even barbara payton turns in a credible performance br br this one isn't often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy go ahead devote an evening to it it is worth your time
<START> bad script check awful effects check horrible actors check lame direction check br br after seeing the dvd box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre i placed my 4 28 on the line and rented this film my girlfriend was out of town and i was bored so on a late tuesday night i decided this would be a perfect time for me to watch what appeared to be based on the box cover art a horror movie what i got instead was the worst film ever made up until that point i had always declared slumber party massacre 3 the worst film ever made br br if you are the type that wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is this is for you if you don't want to lose 4 00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life steer clear of this garbage br br an added note i noticed a few of the actors come on here and post comments on the bulletin board how can you brag about being in this film you were all horrible i mean really bad if there was an american idol for actors you all would be laughed at in the first few episodes br br peace br br cain
<START> if you're looking for an original horror flick this might be the one for you it's strange and at times lingers on stupidity but it's just such a good looking nice sounding and original movie it never fails except maybe during the over long climax is a must see for horror fans or for fans of monster movie make up br br boone craig sheffer has been having dreams of a town called full of mutant creatures in therapy his psychiatrist dr decker horror director david cronenberg has come to the conclusion that boone is a murderer and gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to turn himself in after almost getting killed boone ends up at the hospital where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about and tells boone where to go located in a graveyard is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don't let boone in after escaping with only a nasty bite boone is shot dead by the police who were lead to his location by dr decker but boone isn't dead the bite causes him to live and he goes off to meanwhile boone's girlfriend lori anne bobby tries to find boone and get to the bottom of this when dr decker also finds out about this place chaos ensues br br the plot seems long and complicated but it really isn't hard to understand the plot among other things makes this movie really interesting the make up effects are astounding the creatures look unique and amazing and make this a very appealing film to add to more senses appeal we have a musical score by danny elfman that is both lush and bouncy and fits the film like a glove the shots in the movie are also set up beautifully the cinematography is lovely and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken even the acting is good with the biggest surprise being director david cronenberg giving a great menacing performance as the man who for one reason or another wants to see boone dead it's odd for a horror film to be this well done br br the problems with the movie well there are a few but the positives outweigh the negatives the script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor but almost every one falls flat the mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera the worst part of the film would have to be the climax it takes so long and is just constant chaos it's the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don't know or care about br br overall this movie is amazing to look at it's a well done horror film but even with that said it has the occasional failure in character's lines and a messy climax nonetheless this is one to check out br br my rating out of 101 mins r for strong violence and language
<START> i hate a movie that doesn't have an ending i don't care how good or bad the rest might be i don't like to be left without a conclusion such shows should insist upon a disclaimer something like the movie you are about to watch has either no ending or is so ambiguous as to not be conclusive br br in the movie the last scene we are left with is dee and dominic having a bit of a row and he says almost regretfully i thought that it couldn't be him because the fingers were either that of a girl or a child then it ends well sure the smoking gun so to say is in the hands of the dee's son but what about dominic's daughter i actually thought we might discover it was her anyway unless you like inconclusive movies then i'd avoid this one otherwise i thought the movie generally good
<START> i was enchanted by debut i hope that we'll soon see more of his work i was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief nyc run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as desperately seeking susan and after hours but with a gentle european that made it fresh and fun a strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure and i thought the inter threaded plots were just right sandra bernhard puts in her best performance since king of comedy while peter stormare is hilarious and ling bai touching see it
<START> it finally hit me watching my vhs of christmas in connecticut what other film this one reminded me of if it weren't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later i'd say it was a remake br br just as rock hudson was a phony fishing expert for abercrombie fitch who had to get some on the job training at a fishing tournament barbara stanwyck plays an forties version of martha stewart br br stanwyck's a cooking columnist who's built up this whole image of living on a small connecticut farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous delicacies trouble is she's unmarried childless writes her column from her apartment in new york and doesn't know how to boil water but her writing is a hit with the public br br trouble comes when she's hijacked into cooking a home christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by dennis morgan who gets to sing a couple of songs as well got to keep up the image at any cost and her publisher sidney greenstreet likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner br br so with borrowed farm baby and reginald gardiner who'd like to make it real with stanwyck she tries to brazen it through br br christmas in now a yuletide classic and deservedly so the leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players s z as the hungarian restaurant owner friend of stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and una o'connor as the housekeeper have a nice chemistry between them reginald gardiner and stanwyck have no chemistry at all obvious to all but reggie and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way br br most people remember this film as one of sidney greenstreet's few ventures into comedy if he's not an outright villain a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon greenstreet is few other things on screen christmas in connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it br br in a biography of barbara stanwyck she mentions she enjoyed making christmas in connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like double indemnity she'd been doing recently one of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes director peter godfrey and greenstreet would do some impromptu entertaining of cast and crew with english music hall numbers made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly br br now if only someone had been filming those numbers
<START> to be completely honest i completely intrigued by the original concept of cell ' having watched the best part of the series on fx channel uk my sky got broke meaning i missed the crucial finale but what i did see of it i assumed it to be a great story line good acting and as i don't watch '24' i thought it was great and it's been confirmed for a second season br br one of the best tv programs i have seen much more realistic and believable than 24 excellent character development and plot line does not bash islam but gives a thoughtful and considered approach showing the difference between radical terrorist islam and true islam everybody should see this show br br stringy xx
<START> before i saw this film i read the comment of someone who wasn't very fond of it this i must admit made me apprehensive to dedicate 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to it but i'm glad i did ryan gosling is a fantastic actor i especially loved the believer don cheadle was also fantastic the film presented an interesting view on life and death it was very touching and very sad yet it kept me interested which most touching stories cannot do it is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it you should see it it was unique and i don t think that anyone will ever be able to duplicate it all of the young actors did surprisingly well given the subject matter and the emotion that must have gone into it i was pleasantly surprised
<START> for all the homicide junkies out there this movie was great every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie it helped to resolve some but not all issues from the series unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show's existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we gotta take what we can get i hope they make more movies and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order
<START> this movie stands for its the funniest movie i have ever seen the lines the acting and the clothes wow talk about 70 s if you ever see this little gem buy it its worth every penny by the way the opening song is awsome if anyone know where i can find it send me an e mail
<START> a gem of a cartoon from the silent era it was re discovered by cartoon network and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades if ever br br what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos douglas fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos will hays pays a visit as 'boss' of static studios as well as appearances by chaplin keaton and william s hart the image of chewing gum the shoes of the populace a money making idea for felix's near bankrupt shoe salesman boss cannot be described it must be viewed a terrific cultural gem
<START> what the heck do people expect in horror films these days anyway does is have to be something grisly like or it's just crap now i don't claim to be an all knowing expert but i'm about 47 i've seen and own literally thousands of films and i honestly think this director really gave this film a good sincere effort believe me i was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started assuming it was gonna be awful and i was pleasantly surprised it's no mamet script that's for sure but come on with all the horrible garbage out there especially in horror i thought this one was way closer to the top of the pile than most br br the director used a lot of neat clever camera angles the soundtrack was excellent and moody perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film the editing and timing were very good and it didn't resort to the tired worn clichÃ© of excessive 'slasher' violence for example minor spoiler during an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous but tasty uh i mean tasteful nude shower scene i fully expect her to get sliced and diced but amazingly we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that's it end minor spoiler also the tension was built very well leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what spoiler especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and pinnochio alone in the office we see the doll actually talking to her but in the video recording we do not also the mom sees pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty so are both the mom and daughter mentally ill also there is the original 'killer' and what the mom had surmised about a possible evil influence but even with all that we are still not quite sure who was doing the killing end spoiler so all in all i believe that it was a good strong sincere effort to create some good ol' early full moon type style and with a lot of restraint on the violence and with no typical sleaze thrown in for no reason just the lovely innocent beautiful shower scene which i will remember to the end of my days compared to the absolute mindless drivel out there a definite strong 8 10
<START> after starting watching the re runs of old columbo movies i thought they would all get about the same vote from me 6 but apparently i'm now starting to see differences in the movies it happened in some of just previous episodes that showed some pretty genius directing and it shows in this one but in the negative way br br the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away the directing seems too pretentious the scenes with the oh so mature neighbour girl are a and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid br br some applause should be given to the prelude however in this episode a lot of focus is given on how the murderer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence etc i really liked that but alas no focus on how columbo reveals all this and the proof that in the end leaves columbo victorious is the silliest ever br br rating lies between 4 and 5
