<START> if i wouldn't have had any expectations of this film it might have received a 5 or 6 as it stands i give it a 3 the acting is poor the factual accuracy of the drugs it discusses is lacking and i feel no empathy whatsoever for the characters br br i watched immediately before watching this film and i both laughed and cried on several occasions this film did not strike even a similar chord the directors of traffic' may have some off hand experience of ecstasy but there is no demonstration of actual drug related semantic knowledge here in fact i find it rather offensive and to the strife of making current drug laws less politically oriented br br watch 'requiem for a dream' if what you're looking for is an amazing touching film about drugs
<START> a buster keaton silent short br br poor buster becomes the goat scapegoat for a dangerous escaped murderer br br this is a wonderful hilarious little film with keaton at his absolute best in what is essentially a series of chases buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination big joe roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief br br born into a family of vaudevillian buster keaton 1895 1966 mastered physical comedy at a very early age an association with fatty arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic silent feature length films all from 1920 to 1928 writer director star stuntman buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience more akin to fairbanks than chaplin buster's films were full of splendid adventure exciting derring do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable his theme of a little man against the world who triumphs through bravery ingenuity dominates his films through every calamity disaster buster remained the great stone face a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad br br in the late 1920's buster was betrayed by his manager brother in law and his contract was sold to mgm which proceeded to nearly destroy his career teamed initially with jimmy durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent finally before lung cancer took him at age 70 he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered now well past his centenary buster keaton is routinely recognized appreciated as one of cinema's true authentic geniuses and he knew how to make people laugh
<START> good idea shame about the actual movie would of liked it to be a bit more scary and explain more about the characters and who exactly the evil woman was if she was torturing those kids why were they helping her kill and not helping others kill her its a bit of a come down from malcolm in the middle br br i think it would of benefited from being slightly longer and going into more detail with the characters although after about an hour i was wondering when it would end br br would of been better too if the actual characters that killed them were not in reality it sort of made them crap looking and what happened to the frankie character he fell into a bed of wild roses so should of been safe however the computer game showed him as game over ie dead next thing he appears with that irritating blonde lass to rescue the guy afraid of fire who i noticed had no qualms about flipping the lighter when demon lady was after him br br too many inconsistencies in this movie to really enjoy it however might make you think twice about playing that new computer game
<START> pearl harbor buddy this movie is brilliant sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi million dollar comedy does but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable i'm one that goes for silliness much like dumb and dumber airplane and wet hot american summer and i have to say this easily ranks up there movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece when watching this you will easily find over 20 quotes from it that you will find yourself quoting after wards and after to watch it again you'll find even more
<START> this was such a great film it was done with such beautiful design such symmetry i love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth space and beyond it was such a fluent and thought provoking masterpiece i loved the way the monoliths never changed although primate earth and space did i loved how it was a question of do you need me us now the movie expressed desire peace love curiosity finesse gentleness courage and innocence what more could you ask for from a mere movie perhaps a complement movie any appreciator of 2001 a space odyssey will find the movie 2010 is 2001's complement movie 2010 is more story orientated than 2001
<START> if you are going to watch this film because michael caine or michael are in it then don't bother it's not their typical role although i found fantastic instead watch it for dylan moran i am a fan of everything i have seen him in and this is no exception i didn't even realise he could act but even the characters which he has to pass himself off as i found completely believable which is impressive considering the audience knows they are fake br br the plot is genius and although it is not constant laughs all the way through it has plenty of other charms a great film for people with a sense of humour

<START> any movie that has a line of dialogue that goes something like this judy's getting ready for her date has to be good i found this on dvd unrated unedited and was pleasantly surprised a lot of hard work was put into making this movie i actually enjoyed this more that a lot of 80s movies i have seen great addition to my movie collection br br the buildup was great sets up the scares for the rest of the movie loved the gore and the t a i never thought eyeballs being gouged out would look like popping boils the color of the eye splatter was gross i keep thinking that looked like tiger woods but more black anyone agree
<START> worst movie ever made ever i have no words to say about it other then it truly had no point no plot no anything sheer crap i don't know how everyone in the movie didn't shoot them shelves after watching it i love vampire flicks and mysteries and alternate abstract outside the box films and this was non of those i mean what the crap i cant even tell you what the film was about cuz i still don't know and i just wasted an hour and of my life watching it bottom line i think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs thats the only thing i got from this film please don't watch this i mean for a sultry sensual vampire flick there wasn't even the to be expected nudity you'd get from a vamp flick anyway back to my point this movie blows go set yourself on fire instead
<START> at first i didn't think that the performance by lauren ambrose was anything but flaky but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense amy madigan seemed too terse for her role and didn't really tie her daughter's characters together even though it was apparent that her character was disengaged with the character played by lauren ambrose br br christopher lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line his character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with br br the overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by taylor roberts her comprehensive delivery of a simplistic character held the movie together in this pivotal role taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as the antagonist for all of the other relationships in the film
<START> an interesting period showing us what was amazing in 1938 gosh ma a fake accident ring suing for 25 000 i guess projected into the 21st century it would amount to a lot of money the acting would amount to pure 21st century ham nice to see the president as a hard working newcomer
<START> i haven't laughed this much in a long time or seen a film so ineptly made talk about so bad it made me laugh br br firstly i estimate that for about 40 percent of the film's length i couldn't tell what was happening or indeed even what i was seeing i can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets lsd there are whole segments minutes long where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall people and various other unidentifiable stuff i spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening but they couldn't follow it any better than me br br then there are the black moments when in an effort to scare us everyone's lights go out and the screen turns pitch black and i don't just mean for a few seconds i think the longest lasted almost two minutes i guess blank film is one way to keep costs down br br i suspect the director had recently read a book on all the must do's to make a scary movie and decided to throw them all in about 20 times each br br there are three good things about this film 1 it's short at 90 minutes though still an hour and a half too long 2 all the characters die after all it's impossible to care about any of them 3 there was one genuinely good scene when the group are looking up the shaft they came down after discovering their rope fallen to the bottom saw that coming a large boulder is pushed across the opening sealing them in i wasn't expecting that and it was genuinely chilling br br and what's with the early campfire scenes with the shot after shot after shot panning from behind the camp lights i swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes br br and i'm positive that after the first kill the exact same footage of blood on the cave floor is used twice in about 90 seconds br br all in all a crap piece of film making i'll watch almost anything but this is close to where i'd draw the line
<START> talk about your wild life barely a b movie but what the hay corny sci fi and lesbian sex from the mind of writer and director cody jarrett a cheesy slice of fun a chemical company is dumping waste that is causing mutants in a fish farm the hot kristi russell stars as dr barbara michaels an agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma she just happens to enter a lesbian relationship with bartender trixie shaffer and their love scenes are about as good as this film gets a man size frog incites chaos causing a car crash raping the chemical company boss's daughter raping a girl under the bleachers at a football game stiff arm tackling a runner in the football game raping a nun all before being shot twice in the chest after an antidote was found all ready the special effects well not special a guy in a rubber frog costume without the genitalia to prove himself tough do you still want to watch it go ahead but bribe any witness to secrecy
<START> i loved this movie so worth the long running time i need help with the ending though br br spoiler br br the final shot of marie at the end is this to suggest that she is still searching for or possibly that she was the one who wanted to reinvigorate the 13 she seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to colin in the first place i don't quite understand it but i know i really liked it so if anyone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it please elaborate on the ending br br thanks
<START> i love sarah and was worried about the tv adaptation as i'd been disappointed by the bbc's version of tipping the velvet which although beautiful to look at was let down by hawes not being able to sing and rachael stirling not being able to act is a very tightly plotted novel with breath taking twists and turns and i wondered if this could be done justice to in just 3 hours br br i needn't have worried the adaptation was excellent very little cut out and went along at a cracking pace although i did wonder whether if you hadn't read the book would you miss things it had the look and feel of a bbc classic costume drama and i kept having to remind myself that this is a contemporary book br br the acting was stellar sally hawkins acting her heart out as sue trinder and elaine cassidy a slow burner who by the end of the story was incandescent as maud lilley the love the passion the realisation of the acts of betrayal both would have to perform were written on their faces it was a joy to watch br br i hope rachael stirling was watching that's how you play a sarah waters character
