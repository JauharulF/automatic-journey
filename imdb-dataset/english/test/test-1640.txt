<START> hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie i e the writers directors producers actors editors etc christopher plummer veteran of movies frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck i guess there is nothing wrong with that but once they are paid that doesn't mean anyone has to watch it br br it bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb art if you want to see art go to an art gallery don't watch this movie comedy watch a re run of the flintstones about the same plot with less time wasted br br dabney coleman gives his usual performance for better or worse and some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie but plummer it was embarrassing to watch his performance in fact i was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie knowing this was plummer of sound of music fame i see from his bio that he called sound of music sound of so guess he didn't like it as much as the of millions who liked him in it br br i wonder if today he was asked how do you rate sound of music compared to where the heart is what would he say br br probably something like where the money is
<START> post 1988 after the disaster gjs amitabh's films lost the quality they had earlier br br barring main hoon released in 1989 which was a great film rest all films were craps mostly except hum 1991 later in 1991 br br this is another of the crap amitabh films people rejected in early 90's br br the film he did like a friendship token to shashi kapoor who directed the film and he didn't take a penny the film also had rishi and dimple again not paired each other after br br the film came in 1991 when bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops amongst them br br came 2 years after toofan and both supernatural films which were rejected this is another type of crap bachchan wears a mask and a type outfit and performs magic changing 1 person to a donkey etc of course being 1991 you can excuse the special effects but the film is too bad to be watched br br direction by shashi kapoor is not good music is bad br br amongst actors amitabh had become too old by 1991 and looked tired his acting is okay but not on par with his best rishi is okay dimple is alright rest are forgettable
<START> this is one of the very very few films that are so overwhelming that you are very unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your lifetime other examples are claude documentary shoah and come and see by the director's husband elem which covers much the same unbearable territory but in a very different way br br i suppose this is just as well given the difficulty of ever seeing a print br br apparently it's extraordinarily overt christian symbolism and admission that there were active russian collaborators ensured that it was hardly ever seen in the ussr and of course post soviet russia has very little interest in films of that era br br the one time i saw it in london was in a festival of russian movies shown during the glasnost era i e probably c 1988 however it apparently has been shown several times in the uk more recently so at least one subtitled print must exist here br br as far as i know it has never been released in the west on dvd or video so if you haven't seen it your best chance is probably to join a film society and endlessly nag them to find a print and screen it
<START> this is one of those movies that i can watch again and again and not get tired of it it is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever i liked this one even more than x men in fact this movie is sort of a cross between x men and the matrix and it came out before either wesley snipes does a great job with the character of blade he is just not an emotionless super hero also this movie isn't to get a pg 13 rating sure comic books are for kids mainly but i like a little more in my movies let's face it if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic this comic book adaptation also has something that many don't a good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy let's face it none of the batman movies had a very good ending fight
<START> towards the end of his career jack arnold a very efficient director who gave us such classic 50's creature features as it came from outer space the creature from the black lagoon and tarantula teamed up with former football star turned top 70's blaxploitation film headliner fred the hammer williamson for a pair of movies producing the amiable if unremarkable western the black bounty hunter and this refreshingly breezy clever and highly entertaining 70's black action variant on your standard 40's film noir down at the heels private detective yarn br br williamson displays a charming combination of dry self deprecating humor and relaxed easygoing self confidence as shep stone a cheap affable and forever in debt erstwhile los angeles cop turned private investigator stone's so hard up for cash that he uses a bar as his business office and just barely makes ends meet doing penny ante low paying minor cases that the police don't want to bother with while pounding the pavement for one of these deceptively simple gigs stone's trying to find some guy's runaway teenage daughter who's hiding somewhere in hollywood stone finds himself elbow deep in a complex dangerous seemingly bottomless criminal plot which includes a flipped out jesus freak religious cult assorted deadhead hippie a sordid porno ring a priceless missing gold tipped cane that belonged to a legendary silent movie star a nefarious underground drug smuggling operation and an ever growing number of fresh corpses br br while lacking the wickedly playful mischievous ingenuity of robert altman's masterful the long goodbye or the haunting unremitting pessimism of arthur penn's beautifully bleak night moves black eye nonetheless still makes the grade as a highly successful 70's spin on 40's mystery suspense thrillers arnold's capable direction keeps the pace moving at a nice steady clip punctuated with sporadic exciting mano a mano bare knuckle fight scenes and excellent use of various colorfully seedy l a locations the rundown abandoned amusement park at the film's conclusion is especially effective the script by mark haggard and jim martin supplies a goodly amount of fairly complicated and often genuinely surprising plot twists and the expected array of quirky rough around the edges secondary characters are an interesting oddball bunch with particularly notable turns by rosemary forsyth as an alluring powerful lesbian model agency owner forsyth has the picture's best line boasting to stone when she first meets him i'm a whole lot of woman teresa graves of get christie love tv show fame as stone's loyal bisexual girlfriend the film's casual nonjudgmental depiction of both unconventional femme fatale and graves' equally atypical gal friday is one of its strongest assets and bret morrison who did the voice of radio's the shadow in the 40's as a smugly sleazy porno filmmaker all in all it's a modest yet surefire winner
<START> ray is one of those movies that makes you pause you actually think about what you heard or think about what you read about this man and it doesn't even come close during my first viewing of ray i forgot i was watching a movie i felt like a peeping tom watching this man's life thru a window this movie is so compelling it drags you in and it involves your every emotion you go thru a emotional roller coaster ride and when it's over you don't want to do it again so soon because it has that kind of emotional punch that other movies are lacking jamie foxx deserved his oscar and quite rightfully so his performance is spectacular and it should be held up as the standard for anybody wanting to do a bio pic anytime soon this movie is as good as it's subject both deserved the titles classic and legend
<START> this film is cringingly bad you can tell that all the actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a truly terrible movie there are obvious budget constraints but with a little thought and attention to detail the movie could have been so much better for example check out the scene where mickey first goes to the mortuary and is talking to his friend the pathologist whilst the murdered taxi driver is lying on the slab you can actually see the corpse breathing what couldn't they afford to hire a half decent extra that could hold his breath for a 2 minute scene
<START> i saw this film last night a satire of the reality style programs that seem to be making the rounds at the moment br br what can i say i absolutely hated it about as interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe one or two only slightly amusing moments br br maybe it had something to do with me definately not being a fan of the survivor and big brother type shows but if this had been a video dvd or if i'd been watching at the cinema on my own i would have definately not endured more than the first 5 minutes br br
<START> this is the first porn i've ever tried to review it demands a different approach than usual since the allegory will not reward dissection i'm american i'm a prudish virgin we are european we are cultured and sex mad it is nice when we all screw each other lots to talk about well there kind of is in fact relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway and the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean detailed compositions but what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn ok then the only scene i really rhetorically got off on was the first time brigitte steps in there are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus and multiple takes or not one perhaps on imdb act does look like it was partially simulated by a surgical hose still i stayed awake and it was eight in the morning but what does the last shot mean
<START> i wanted to see this movie because i liked prisoner of the mountains and brat brother with bodrov jr and the thief with vladimir well unlike the other movies the quickie was a total waste of time the story that makes little sense very uneven acting lesley ann warren was especially bad really awful dialogs poor cinematography what else could go wrong i find it amusing that in practically every american made movie when the same language speaking foreigners russians in this case are left alone they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in broken english and when they happen to speak russian for some reason translators feel obligated to add a lot of f ks in the sentences which have no profanity literal or non literal at the same time native english speaking actors choose to speak in broken russian why is that getting back to the story most of the subplots of the movie e g betting the house inviting latin american paramilitaries etc either make no sense or do nothing more than confusing the viewers it is too bad that bodrov and leigh all good actors in my humble opinion got themselves involved in this disaster
<START> gene hackman is a former marine corps colonel who musters a handful of private vietnam vets to go back to and rescue some americans who have been listed as missing in action hackman suspects that in actuality the half dozen or so mias are secretly being held in a remote camp by to be tormented and to provide more hard labor hackman is being paid by the wealthy robert stack whose son like hackman's son is thought to be among the mias but the circumstances are such that hackman can only manage to buy old and out dated weapons though he manages to pick up the help of a anti communist and his two daughters along the way br br i don't think the movie was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of the still holding our mias for propaganda purposes the myth was real enough if anyone remembers there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983 bring back the mias i think instead that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth it was absurd on the face of it why would our former enemy refuse to return mias propaganda where is the propaganda value in something that's kept secret to add the labor supply they need a hundred extra laborers in vietnam and the motives behind this movie with its triumphant music and high body count were scurrilous br br but how about the movie itself stripped of its theme of rescuing mythical mistreated mias it's a routine paramilitary actioner no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s gene hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water he's just about always reliable br br of the others this being a formulaic plot derived from the dirty dozen among others i kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission of the three anti communist asians i figured one or more were dead meat that's why asian helpers appear in movies like this i was right two times out of three i also figured patrick as the rookie ex officer the youngest of the group who'd never earned the respect of the others because he'd never seen combat would also have to go in some heroic mode wrong he becomes a hero true but survives intact i thought there was a fifty fifty chance that hackman would have to go too but he makes it out okay the formula doesn't really stretch for originality either charles bronson's claustrophobic pow escapee from the great escape is here in fred ward's ex tunnel rat a who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it so that he can do a recon on the pow camp br br the title uncommon valor is from a tribute that admiral nimitz made to the men on iwo jima uncommon valor was common that day nimitz was certainly right about that whether or not the men who fought in vietnam were all equally is remote from the point anyone who saw combat or even came near it putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them were heroic enough this movie and the way it exploits our bitterness about the vietnam war doesn't really do them justice
<START> ok the end of this may be something of a letdown after what has come before and klaus kinski should have had his 10 second appearance cut out but there is no getting away from the fact that this is a really wonderful atmospheric euro thriller i can't believe i have never seen this till now its good to know there are films out there that are still worth tracking down and this really is stunning visuals haunting and builds an amazing atmosphere florinda balkan is perfect as our heroine and the scene on the beach with is some of the most relaxed and perfect acting you could see lila kedrova is spot on as a fellow visitor to the town who may or may not be who she seems if you miss the hay days of euro cinema then chase this out there's a decent widescreen print going round and please get this out in a restored dvd someone they did it with the directors fifth cord and this is a much better film
<START> i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almodÃ³var but this would have to be the most disappointing so far this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films and the story just never got me interested many almodÃ³var regulars appear in this film so it's not like there was a lack of on screen talent but this film just seemed more serious than his other films if there was a comedic edge to this movie i certainly couldn't find it and it made for one surprisingly weak movie
<START> who the heck is responsible for this terrible mangling of one of my favorite books this is just terrible terrible acting terrible script the story isn't even close to its old self and what were they thinking robin williams for sake this really defies description don't see this seriously don't not even for laughs especially not if you're a fan of the book this might just be the worst movie adaptation ever everything is disjointed and scrambled the characters which are important in order to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized and every potentially interesting location from the book has been changed example vienna new york into something profoundly uninteresting br br for those who haven't read the book it's basically a fictional biography about a writer growing up exploring his writing and so on his mother writes an autobiography which is hailed despite her protests as a sort of feminist manifesto the book is well written engaging and long its prose is simply beautiful br br this movie on the other hand is about robin williams once again telling us to seize the day
<START> this is basically your run of the mill violent biker flick complete with nifty crashes and music ok so just and crashes it's a slight notch above much of the other fare featured on mst3k but it's still the equivalent of driving a nail into your kneecap slow and painful to give away plot would exhaust my energy so i'll just say you're better off skipping this one
