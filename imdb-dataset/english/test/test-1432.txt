<START> excellent story telling and cinematography poignant biting social commentary br br superb effects well filmed and acted br br however the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures though very well done at times drags on a little too much about 3 hrs and over interrupts the flow of the story br br i first read the book as a child and enjoyed the parts about the giants and the tiny people but the book lost me when it got to the floating island and the land of the yahoos well although the adventure plot may sound like a children's story it's in fact a very adult story full of symbolism about the moral decay in england at the time of jonathan swift the author of the novel that the film is based upon
<START> a perennial fixture in the imdb bottom 100 upon viewing this it's not hard to see exactly why for it proves to fail utterly miserably in just about every bloody department going br br take the editing for a start to call this choppy would be overly complimentary indeed had the makers of this got drunk one night and sliced and diced the film reels with some scissors and children's glue then the resulting mess could hardly have been any worse than what we actually have here added to this the inane story drags on mercilessly for what seems like a torturous infinity before we finally reach the decidedly lacklustre climax br br aside from the ever game michael poor performances from most of the rest of the cast don't exactly help matters any either and the actual beastie that is causing all the troubles is somewhat less than convincing to put it mildly yay verily all in all this is a complete pile of crap if ever i've seen one br br deary deary me and to think that lamberto bava directed this to tut tut indeed br br note this was released in the uk under the alternative title of devouring waves although bereft of most of its gore scenes which ironically are just about the only reason that this may have been worth watching
<START> i'm sorry but this guy is not funny i swear i've heard heard 4 year olds come up with better jokes then some of his dee dee dee for instance is possibly the worst catch phrase i've ever heard it lacks any creativity at all and to be making fun of mentally challenged people when you've reached level of having your own show is incredibly dim witted on mencia's part br br though every one compares this fool to their is no contest first off they had very very different shows i think all in all show on average had only about 2 short 5 minute skits in between his 10 minute rants about god knows what show came off more as sketch comedy with 2 4 skits that occupied all the show all did was a short summarization of each skit before and after each one this is where mencia fails even more what would make mencia think having a show which consists of the same standup comedy that he talks about on his standup specials would be a beneficial idea does anybody really want to listen to a bit george lopez pioneered years before mencia but just dragged beyond belief to the point where its dead chance in hell br br my point is even though most people hate this guy for his rascism i just cant stand him for his comedy central was looking for a minority they could brand as controversial and then leave him to follow path the problem is this guy made it very clear he doesn't want to be so instead he conducts his crappy show like a burning trainwreck right into the ground does anybody want to watch a weekly standup about the same stuff every thursday i know sure as hell i don't br br i cant express my gratitude to comedy central though this show is done personally after watching his standup i don't know how he got his own show in the first place there are so many more deserving comics like jim zach etc in fact anyone is better than this fool
<START> many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of the man who knew too much which i have not had the opportunity to view by itself the '56 version is a very well done film the run of mid to late fifties hitchcock films including rear window dial m for murder vertigo and to catch a thief as well as this film is one of my favorite periods in his career in the man who knew too much jimmy stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always doris day is very believable in the role of an atypical hitchcock blond i thought there was nothing fake about her performance her character may not have been written as strongly as the original but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive yes dear pretty thing on jimmy stewart's arm br br there were some really clever lines written for hank the couple's son who later gets kidnapped in the opening scene on the bus it's too bad christopher olsen read them so woodenly it's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s though most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent though most notably the assassin played by reggie br br some little touches that make this film undeniably hitchcockian the use of non english dialog especially french something hitch did on a much larger scale in to catch a thief the use of foreboding arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears stewart and day talking to each other in the church singing their words to the tune of the hymn the albert hall scene specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score building up tension as well as the percussionist getting the ready and finally the assassin's gun as it appears from behind the curtain it moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically an effect hitch used at the end of spellbound also br br all in all the man who knew too much is a fun film to watch it's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films vertigo strangers on a train but all the same it is one of my top five hitchcock masterpieces
<START> this was included on the disk shorts volume 2 a rather dull collection of short films shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people assembling this second collection had a hard time finding quality content and it wasn't nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts collections br br this short film feels like it's woefully incomplete there is a story but so much in unanswered that the viewer like me feels a bit left out and unfulfilled br br the film begins with a woman her boyfriend and her that's a dog by the way going to a lonely beach the lady speaks with an accent that at times is a bit difficult to follow given that i am hard of hearing i sure would have loved if it had been closed captioned anyway the boyfriend goes for a swim while she naps when she awakens her dog is gone she panics and makes the guy follow her all about looking for the dog they spend most of the time arguing and being disagreeable then out of the blue they stop to have sex later they find the dog end of story br br as far as the characters go both seemed rather dysfunctional and unlikable she was a fussy and demanding lady and he seemed to have contempt for her when you wondered why they were together their little sex break showed what bond kept them together br br some might like the characterizations i kept finding the people irritating and unreal more like caricatures than people you might meet or know also the payoff for all this just isn't worth the wait unless you want to see the guy naked
<START> the above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film as the series followed a very similar format as usual simon templar the saint meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid he also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe along the way he meets some interesting supporting characters this time paul as pearly gates and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery none of them really are templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool george sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated british do gooder and he succeeds once again in making an excellent b detective series film nothing particularly special but a familiar and breezy product sure to please fans of the genre
<START> la ragazza del or terror express as it was called on the version i saw starts as various passengers board a long distance train three thuggish idiots dave phil ernie carlo de board it's clear that they're there to cause trouble as they intimidate verbally abuse the other passengers staff as the train speeds along things turn nasty when a prostitute named juliette silvia refuses to have sex with dave he his mates decide to hold the entire train hostage so they can have an orgy with juliette well not much else actually happens apart from some hero cop his prisoner who set about saving the day erm that's it really br br this italian production was directed by is complete total utter crap from start to finish the script by george eastman as luigi could just as easily be described as a really boring porno as much as a horror thriller it is tediously slow it's 35 minutes before anything even remotely sleazy happens as a whole the film lacks the sort of exploitation elements that italian sleaze horror was delivering at that time the film can be compared to another italian production the infinitely better the house on the edge of the park 1980 made the same year it's a very broad comparison though as everything that made the house on the edge of the park the notorious film that it is is absent from la ragazza del there's no blood no gore almost no violence there's only a couple of really tame rapes the story has no twists or turns as it's incredibly boring to watch italian sleaze horror from the late 70's early 80's isn't known for it's strong story lines or great scripts but this films really does scrape the bottom of the barrel on all counts the character's are awful the film spends the first 30 plus minutes building them up giving some background as to why they're on the train but this is all quickly forgotten comes to absolutely nothing i hated the lame ending as well i don't know if i missed something but was any sort of reasonable explanation given as to why these three would hijack a train i don't think there was was there i'm sorry but because your angry at a prostitute is not enough of a reason surely the filmmakers could have come up with something a bit more substantial interesting if not more plausible in my opinion this film stinks it's as simple straight forward as that i'm afraid br br director does an ok job to be fair he only has one corridor a few train compartments to work with so i'll cut him some slack having said that the film does become very repetitive there is no style he films the sex scenes like a bad soft core porno complete with awful romantic sounding piano music there is not one single drop of blood spilt in the entire film that's right not one single drop forget about any gore or violence as you'll be very disappointed if you do like i did there are a couple of rapes but they're amateurishly staged have zero impact the nasty exploitation sleaze of say i spit on your grave 1978 or the last house on the left 1972 is not here br br technically la ragazza del is ok it's quite well made on what must have been a low budget but the setting obviously helped keep the cost down to a minimum the acting is poor as usual although since it was dubbed the original performances have been lost fans of italian horror will recognise a lot of the voices here br br la ragazza del is a terrible film it's just my opinion but i was bored to tears waiting for something to happen when it eventually never i felt cheated i want those 80 minutes of my life back this piece of crap isn't even fit to grace the 99p vhs bargain bin in your local blockbuster one to avoid
<START> i was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater i've thought about it frequently ever since after two dvd viewings i'm glad to say it held up perfectly like any great comedy i laughed more on each viewing both in anticipation of gags but also after catching things missed before br br mike judge does very well with creating insanely comedic characters and fitting them into their world so they make sense in office space the environment make the characters believable future gives him liberty to write unbelievably dumb characters and make them work i'll be waiting to see if they release a better dvd with some actual features before buying it but this movie deserves the support on dvd not offered to it at the theater
<START> this is a story of a long and awkward love the daily life of a woman of 50 years old and some people around her is depicted her daily life is so ordinary and routine that i doubted who was the real lead character in the beginning then the audiences know that the woman and a man who was her high school class mate had very tiny connection the woman has been doing the same job a milk woman and a supermarket so long there are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job the man had married another woman who is now dying of cancer he works at the city hall and devotedly cares her at home they never look straight nor talk each other but they never forget each other br br the original japanese title means at some time the days you read books but of course when the man said now i want to do what i've always wanted to do it was to hug her and make love with her she writes to a radio disk jockey that if god gives us time to talk we need at least a whole day dreaming of that day she has been the desire in hard work and book reading i personally know a woman who has loved a man for long years even after he married another woman and died for an accident therefore the story setting is not that special rather this movie well portrays unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women through this movie you will recall your romance that is lost long ago this is a movie with lasting effect
<START> stu ungar is considered by many to be the greatest poker gin player of all time an extraordinary self destructive force of nature tiny in stature but a huge heart for the game br br what we have here is a kind of hallmark film about the dangers of gambling sure he wins he loses he blows it all on sex drugs and more gambling we get it but where is the real play where is what made him the greatest card player of all time br br much too flat and frankly boring in places this gets a four because we get to learn something about stu the man but stu the card player nada br br nicely shot and presented up to a point this is the perfect example of how not to make a film about cards honestly coverage of the world series is more watchable than this br br a waste of a great chance
<START> terrible boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than uwe's horrible first film it consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the infection these soldiers are your typical lambs to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn out or at least aren't very interesting so you don't feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of the film has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatter it even has the same munching on guts it just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory and the story's climax is rather anti climactic and ridiculous one wonders how two people can submerged in an army of zombies and not get bit for they are the main stars who seem to always manage while others seem to get bit rather easily the film sole motivation is to show people getting bit nothing else just go watch a romero film for lasting effect
<START> caper film is not as good as his most famous movie the deliciously stylish le samourai 1968 i don't even think this is the best example of the much loved heist subgenre the main thing against the film is its long running time has this tendency of concentrating on too many trivial details he could have told the same story in a relative short time but for reasons that i don't understand the film seems to go on and on still the movie is never boring melville's direction impressed me and the cast is very good especially alain delon as a very cool master thief the movie's must see color photography is a great asset and melville uses sound or lack of sound in a very effective manner from a technical standpoint the movie is practically flawless at times one gets the feeling that is merely showing off but when someone is as talented as he is one has little reason to complain i still like other heist movies a little bit more jules dassin's topkapi 1964 just to name one but there is no denying that this film is a good piece of pulp entertainment and a good example of what people refer to as cool cinema
<START> hey its great not to have to wait for the next star trek convention to see hick trek its a cheesy film by a bunch of with no budget but a good way to spend an hour they got most of the special effects right the dialog is classic trek and it just feels right for a trek knockoff
<START> i saw this superb documentary at the santa barbara int'l film festival it is extremely absorbing and very well crafted drawing you into the life and career of harry nilsson one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960's and 70's while i was familiar with his better known compositions one is the number without you i learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful singing if you love music you'll find plenty to draw you in to his world which unfortunately spiraled out of control as his success increased and his past haunted him however sad he nonetheless was completely devoted to his family and you will find yourself so glad to have met this man the profile is effectively told through own words and those of his friends and colleagues a virtual who's who of rock who loved and respected him don't miss this
<START> this is a gently amusing coming of age comedy that comes from the later more mature period of neil simon's writing although there are plenty of wisecracks to go around this is not one of those neil simon pieces where every character spouts out one liner jokes for 2 hours like they're guest stars on a bob hope special there are also dramatic elements some work some are overkill that lend some weight to the story br br the performances are good across the board especially blythe danner as the mother although she and judith were oddly wasp ish choices to play jewish women i've never been a fan of jonathan silverman but i will say that he hits the right notes as the obnoxious gawky and totally horned up teen age narrator protagonist of the story br br the movie is very similar in tone to woody allen's radio days but the latter is far more imaginative and funny than this one
