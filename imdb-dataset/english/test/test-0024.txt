<START> best around the middle when most characters get horny and go after someone they haven't had before it is around this point that we get to see susan sarandon's majestic breasts even if through a veil strangely enough beverly d'angelo who isn't shy about nudity doesn't show any at all while aida turturro Â of all people Â does on the other end of the spectrum the less said about walken playing a homosexual the better the film itself has little plot the dialogs from the theater play and the normal dialogs cross over often and that's not the sort of thing i'd consider a good idea life in the theater who cares occasionally the dialog has something going for it but the film drags in stretches
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed gabrielle burton's story of a mysterious gift and how it effects it recipients in the past and present the talented burton family of five film making sisters an author mother and dancing dad offer a charming plot respectfully edited for clarity memorably chosen songs and a beautifully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry as the characters' invited me into their there was a farce like attitude about this work with touching undertones of innocent wonder
<START> the is one of the best love stories i have ever seen much better and deeper than romeo juliet or spielberg's titanic love impresses me every time her search her battle is exceptional gerda becomes a strong loving woman throughout the movie kay is the poisoner of dark forces the temptation this story encourages me to fight like gerda for the only one for the love of my life for mister right patience is one of the keywords of this movie i cry every time when i realize all the suffering of gerda and kay and i wish that it ends soon tells although my life i deeply identify with the story and the characters thanks at least for hans christian anderson and the director
<START> well i'm not about to add to the diatribe that's been about this film br br all i can add is that at no time does it even pretend to be a picture unlike 'titanic' or 'the patriot' all of which have very credible and serious historical purely for effect possible the worst of excuses br br has everyone taken a sense of humor bypass br br all i can add is a paraphrase from the good captain 'it looked br br fantastic and we have a bloody good br br one last point what me is that there are comments relating to the 'modern music' in a historic setting i wonder if the same people made the same judgment about moulin rouge i suggest not
<START> anthony 'the english patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of hollywood it is grand and impressive in scale and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering at the 1997 academy awards the film owned the night taking home nine awards from twelve nominations the most decisive since bertolucci's 'the last in 1988 based on canadian author michael 1992 booker prize winning novel of the same name 'the english patient' is a touching meditation on life love and loss tracing the history of a critically burnt man in the aftermath of world war two br br during the war a man ralph fiennes is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane with his face scarred beyond recognition and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia he is assumed to be an allied soldier and is simply referred to as the english patient after the war in the mine ridden hills of italy a kind nurse hana juliette binoche who has apparently lost everybody close to her remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man over time she comes to learn more and more about her english patient who is actually revealed to be a hungarian count de rather than losing his memory in the plane crash we learn that this scar ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love via numerous flashbacks we learn of former exploits in the sahara desert and his romantic liaison with a married woman katharine clifton kristin scott thomas br br it's certainly easy to see why 'the english patient' was so successful at the oscars it is such a beautiful film blending the quiet beauty of the italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert cinematographer john captures the landscape to perfection not since david lean's magnificent 'lawrence of arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from plane even in the film's more intimate moments excellent use of close ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene coupled of course with the brilliant performances from all the cast members br br a long time favourite actor of mine 'the english patient' might just contain ralph fiennes' finest performance and considering his history includes such films as 'schindler's list' and 'the constant gardener ' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly his count de is initially a very sympathetic character but as we slowly learn more about his past his likable qualities are eroded by his less admirable tendencies towards others ownership is a major theme of the film when asked by katherine what he hates most replies with ownership being owned when you leave you should forget me however as the relationship progresses and katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him reveals a hint of arrogance insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes i want to touch you i want the things which are mine which belong to me br br juliette binoche who received an oscar for her performance here is excellent as hana the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her after some time of caring for alone she is joined by a dubious canadian thief david caravaggio willem dafoe who lost his thumbs during the war and who suspects that it was who betrayed him to the germans hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with kip andrews an indian bomb in the british army however due to her past history hana is afraid that becoming involved with kip will doom him to death particularly considering his very dangerous line of work br br at 160 minutes in length 'the english patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old successfully finding a balance of mystery love joy and tragedy the ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful but also uplifting in its own way whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning others have a very good chance of bringing happiness nevertheless in every case it is always better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
<START> the kite runner was beautiful poignant and very moving i particularly loved the two child actors in the film as well as the actor portraying the father it really made me want to go back and read the book again br br the music was a wonderful part of the fabric of the movie if there is a soundtrack coming out for the film i will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book it is also a visually stunning film the cinematography was gorgeous and really added to experience br br the brazilian word is very descriptive of how i felt at the end of the film it is a deep feeling of longing for someone or someplace which is very sweet but also tinged with an inescapable sadness definition provided years ago by antonio carlos br br saw it at a small cinema here for an advance screening i would love to see it again on a really large screen with a tricked out sound system br br can't wait for the formal release i will definitely recommend the film to friends
<START> felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines a ham a ham my kingdom for a ham sandwich the dramatic guy that tells felix he'll have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies he's in tears felix just looks at him like he's nuts and shrugs his shoulders the old guy tells felix to go ye forth and find money to finance a trip to hollywood felix thinks how does he expect me to get the money br br in minutes of course this is a cartoon he spots a shoe business owner putting up a bankrupt sale on his store felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat 500 if it works br br well it does but the man wants to go alone and leave felix at home in an outrageous scene felix transforms himself into a briefcase and that's how he gets to hollywood transforming himself back to cat when they get there br br we then witness felix's attempts at getting into show business his audition scenes are very funny especially with his imitation of charlie chaplin in addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives in all quite a bit of material is in this 9 5 minute cartoon it's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2 5 minutes assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length br br at any rate there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon like felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes crazy stuff
<START> it would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is initiated with a brief tale about hypocrisy of hollywood people it was in 1988 that chuck norris saw this film at cannes international film festival he made a silly remark by uttering that the senseless killing depicted in 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in his hollywood films with him as a potent action star he was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in kieslowski's film by a reckless psychopath who hits him cruelly with a big stone there should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society this is the reason why chuck norris' statement appears as a cruel joke which defends violent means in a society which is increasing becoming restless an honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if he she states that kieslowski's film 1 5 has universal connotations this is because the events depicted in 5 can happen in any part of world the best lesson which gives to us concerns levels of violence which are acceptable in a just society this is the reason why the brutal slaying of an innocent cab driver is capable of causing a feeling of in us we would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in films featuring arnold schwarzenegger chuck norris and jean claude van damme as they appear much too artificial one can easily grasp that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers but make no sense to serious film enthusiasts kieslowski also champions helplessness of human beings in rescuing fellow humans beings from the clutches of death and misery this is particularly interesting as time and again it has been proved that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide
<START> i chose to watch this film because i am a stephen nichols fan unfortunately i am unhappy with mr nichols' choice to do this movie the film was slow badly acted and included some very graphic sex scenes of mr nichols' character with a very young woman watch at your own peril
<START> i've watched a number of and sub rosa extreme movies lately and have found a lot to like about them br br this movie seemed a lot more slight than all the others i've seen perhaps that's because this is a comedy horror movie rather than straight horror and perhaps it's also because the humor didn't register with me very well br br it's a little less than seventy minutes long and the credits begin as the last ten minutes are beginning there are some outtakes goofs and behind the scenes stuff going on while those credits roll br br movies do tend to be short and tend to feel padded out in spite of that this is no exception with some scenes that tend to go on too long br br the story involves a poor kid in california who'd been picked on by all his classmates he'd had one shoe stolen and unable to replace it he was dubbed due to an obsession with pirates his parents gave him an eyepatch for christmas with a christmas tree emblazoned on the eyepatch br br many of the classmates are killed and the few who remain gather together to decide what to do they're picked off one by one by who stalks around to the sound of sleigh bells ringing br br the characters are pretty much all broad stereotypes like the nerd named etc there's an odd scene in which a kinky couple has sex the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded the man wears a large paper watermelon slice over his head this reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from director rinse dream br br the picture quality is good and there are a lot of extras but basically a pretty silly movie br br oh well i guess you can never have too many christmas horror movies still there are a lot of other needy holidays
<START> this movie is a very enjoyable homage to the bogart and other detective films of old robert sacchi nails it as bogie and michelle phillips is a truly timeless beauty as gena br br however the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a hollywood film one well known professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement br br the scene which ends up being an important part of the plot occurs in a lushly beautiful middle eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing the pulsating music the swirling veils and ringing finger free flowing undulations and beautiful costumes and a surprise twist involving the seductive sybil danning build tension and excitement until the very end br br the three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by exotic brunette beauty kamala one of the us' leading belly dancers since the mid 1970s she was hand picked by famed musician guy to travel with his orchestra on the road guy's ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform to in the scene if you watch the trailer on this site you will see a glimpse of kamala playing the finger behind sybil danning br br if you're not yet a fan of belly dancing you will be after watching this movie and if you're an aficionado it holds up very well after repeated viewing
<START> another great tom wilkinson performance punctuates separate lies a 2005 film also starring emily watson linda bassett and rupert everett directed by julian fellowes it's the story of a married couple james and ann manning where the husband wilkinson believes he and his wife watson are happy together an accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around it is a hit and run that killed their maid maggie's bassett husband james becomes suspicious of a neighbor bill everett when he sees some damage on his car he confronts who admits he did it and promises to go to the police the next day when james arrives home ann is angry that he is making such a big deal out of it and states that she was driving the car of course james then isn't so eager to rush to the police she suggests that they call and tell him their decision oh f james says well that's just it ann says i am f ing james' devastation is just the beginning in this well crafted drama without giving the plot away this is a good example of how gender switching changes a story example of what i mean susan smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown she gets life in prison what if the father had done it the chair you'd be surprised how often the outcome would be different the same is true here if it had been james having the affair and doing the subsequent activities viewers might feel differently about the story if ann were in james' place it would be shattering as it is it's tremendously sad br br tom wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blindsided by the woman he adores and emily watson does a beautiful job as ann who once she frees herself from her lies her involvement in the accident and the happy marriage knows what she has to do rupert everett as is very effective indolent uppity and ultimately in need everyone here is very civilized in their dealings with one another and no one is all good or all bad br br there are separate lies james that his marriage is happy ann's as listed above and there is one uniting lie the accident about which all parties keep quiet it's enough for ann that maggie knows in the end all must deal with the separate lies that the single lie uncovered br br brilliant film
<START> the director has no clue i know that is the obvious comment maybe we should delve into the story the relationships how about the quality of the actors br br the story is well idiotic would be a simple yet honest answer br br the actors are they tried very hard can they be faulted for the director's choices br br all i can say is br br why was this made br br well isn't this an embarrassment to the korean american film industry br br should we be selective about who we support br br am i being too harsh check it out for yourself
<START> it's a mystery to me as to why i haven't caught up to this masterful 50s caper film Â turned brooding noir until now but i'm certainly glad to report that it didn't disappoint i haven't seen any of jules dassin's american films for several years but based on this i'll probably be going back and re watching brute force and night and the city quite soon br br jean a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its world weariness and coldness has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films hey there wouldn't be a story otherwise isn't coping well with the straight life an opportunity presents itself an easy multi million dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men the taut filming of the robbery half an hour of total silence is what people most remember about the film of course and indeed it's pretty remarkable but i liked the half completed location of the final shootout once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves the excellent portrayal gritty sides of paris in stark black and white and channeling of both eddie constantine and humphrey bogart in his spare but brutal performance br br perhaps it's a bit too sentimental in the end but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn't exactly deep or thought provoking george at turns modernist romantic and jazzy score is another highlight
