<START> one can only sit in utter amazement at this mess of a film and be amused at some of the raves people have bestowed upon it the biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to make up his mind as to whether it's black comedy farce or a combination of both it meanders all over the place in search of direction and has some utterly embarrassing performances that might be better suited to bad sitcom what a shame to see the talented dianne comic talents squandered and the ever annoying jane birkin is so over the top she's more bothersome than usual br br perhaps a lot of the positive criticism is due to the quirky french nature of the film therefore it's labeled smart or genius it's neither instead it's bad tripe that leaves a rather rancid after taste merchant ivory should stick to the serious stuff as they certainly have no comprehension of comedy
<START> the beguiled is one of my favorite clint eastwood films and a departure from his typical early roles directed by don siegel with whom eastwood collaborated on several films it was made a year before eastwood's directorial debut with play misty for me an alternate title considered for the film was pussy footing down at the old plantation which thankfully was not used otherwise i am sure raunchy jokes about the fact that it takes place at a girls' school would be difficult to avoid i first saw this movie in one of my college film classes in the mid 1970's and was immediately taken with it i only had an old battered vhs tape of it until i recently purchased the widescreen dvd which also includes the hilarious awful trailer that makes the film come across as a peyton place soap opera and conveys none of the creepiness of the film br br interesting notes eastwood and siegel had to battle with universal pictures to keep the original ending and they won out and the film was billed as a standard eastwood western which it certainly is not it is a gothic tale of deception and horror set in the time of the civil war with an underlying tone of eroticism and sexual tension running throughout br br i'm not putting any spoilers in this review and if you want to see the film as it should be seen then be careful of looking it up on the internet as spoiler reviews of it do abound br br clint eastwood portrays john a union soldier who is shot on confederate ground and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girls' school she rescues him and takes him back to the school but instead of notifying the local patrol of his presence so that he will be taken to prison the headmistress miss martha geraldine page her assistant edwina elizabeth hartman their black servant hallie mae mercer and the mostly teenage girls take him in heal him and fall under his spell the film sets its tone of creepiness and gothic horror right from the titles as it shows real battleground shots from the war while eastwood's voice is heard quietly singing a funereal song of the time br br the opening scene of his encounter with the little girl who saves him sets the tone of his character and the tone of the entire movie to say any more than that would spoil the surprises in that first scene to say much more about the film itself might ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it if you are into creepy gothic tales find it and rent it eastwood is excellent in the film and it is interesting to see him in an early role or any role where he portrays a character that is for the most part very unsympathetic br br geraldine page had a plum role in the film as the headmistress and i cannot imagine another actress of the time being as good in the role a long shot could have been piper laurie but i don't think laurie could have embodied the role in the same manner as geraldine page br br elizabeth hartman whose wonderful performance in the film a patch of blue as a blind girl who falls in love with sidney character is another high point in her short career is at her prime here delicate and masterful at the same time unfortunately her delicacy on film was also a part of her real life she committed suicide at age 45 br br i end this review with this observation one manipulative lying yankee man is no match for a of deceptive and libidinous southern belles
<START> stanley kubrick a director who i hold in the highest of for his masterpieces clockwork orange 2001 the killing the shining dr strangelove etc took the film out of circulation leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists after seeing the film for myself i could see why at the age of 24 kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for look magazine and had done a few short documentaries like many first time filmmakers that came in the decades after him his ambition for fear and desire was in short to just go and make a film cheaply more than likely to see if he could do it on that level he was successful however the film itself definitely is not br br i can't really say that the film is a failure because there was something i did like about it throughout even as the film's story went on the wayside and the actors whom kubrick didn't have any idea how to direct not being a man of the theater his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film at times there are some shots of close ups and quick shots in suspense action scenes that are eye catching unfortunately this is all the good i can really say of the film although there are a couple of 'name' actors in the film frank who also appeared in killer's kiss and paul mazursky a director in his own right the performances overall are dull and very routine br br in fact that is the film's main demise for me whenever i watch any kubrick film even his early film noirs killer's kiss and the killing i can tell who made it as his style by then became distinct which would continue as he evolved as an artist it wasn't 'artsy' like i might have pictured which is usually the case with first time directors like scorsese and spielberg but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasn't kubrick it felt like a lot of the time i was watching some b or even c grade movie by a director that time forgot not quite 'ed wood' bad but close the music is as standard as can be the fades are pedestrian and the plot seems to not really hold that much attention br br in short as others have said and which i can agree this is a doodle pad of a future ground breaker who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage but not enough to really recommend except to those like myself who end up seeing everything by kubrick or perhaps have to see every ultra low budget war film ever made if only out of curiosity
<START> a great combination chabat's humor world and characters limited presence of christian clavier br br the original comics was great one of the better of an overall great series and alain chabat one of the funniest member of the famous french group les was able to film replicate and supplement the great work done by and by cleverly enforcing the story giving to his best role at last a little bit far from his usual part gathering a bunch of great actors gerard is wonderful as often chabat himself is a great cesar br br in addition while being obligated to keep on with christian clavier as asterix chabat cleverly tuned down his role in the movie to give prominence to and which is always a good idea br br great environment great scenario great director great actors great humor beautiful cleopatra this movie would have deserved a 10 if clavier hadn't been involved
<START> not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape does i know youngsters and 30 40 years old fans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this t v miniseries it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on t v character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera yet in the same episode it has science fact fiction that would give even the hardiest trekkie a run for his money in the stakes wormhole theory time travel in true form magnificent it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from br br with such a broad scope it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where farscape really comes into it's own element it succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically zero element they ran out of ideas pretty quickly kept rehashing them over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audience's attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever get the girl after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia farscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nights br br do yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i mean br br farscape comet
<START> i just have watched icon on dvd and despite being a great book the movie is a weak from it those responsible for the writing should be banished to siberia why they maul the great story with all kind of c film which are totally irrelevant to the story is totally beyond me br br yet the filmmakers and cast do there best to make something out of it but at the end the film was not satisfying at all br br can someone please make a decent movie out of this to show how it is done i'm sure that the crowds will rally for such a masterpiece novel turned into a book not into a cheap c movie
<START> i liked this movie way too much my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside of ironside is just a low rent jack nicholson i guess mike was busy that year with highlander 2 the sadly beastmaster 2 would have been a much better career move it is certainly the best of the beastmaster series and in many ways reminiscent of that great big screen classic masters of the universe not only does it star the incomparable mark singer it also features an amazing supporting cast specifically the second girl from sliders uncle phil from fresh prince of and evil chick from superman 2 it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets beastmaster forever roll
<START> the relationship between the main characters i thought was very realistic how the two end up involved is believable it doesn't have that whole oh yeah right that most hollywood movies have not too mention how they captured the sexy beautiful and painful side of trapeze i am a trapeze student and i love that they showed how hard it is on the body hands and yeah those fabric burns are brutal definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie i loved it i'm happy with the way the movie ended but i definitely wanted to see more be sure to stay seated through the credits for a special treat hehe great scene
<START> carlos is perhaps not the most original comic but the first series was amusing his forthright comments and observations were fresh i missed a couple of seasons but after all of the allegations of stealing material i caught a couple of episodes of the mind of mencia at the end of july 07 a bit of a change i see carlos is much more into toilet humor and sex jokes than the race observations in one episode he sort of implied he was in the same league as chris rock and dave i think not perhaps comedy central will give him one more season but episodes i saw sounded tired and samey with more words beeped out than the carlos go back to stand up for a couple of years get some fresh material and try again
<START> i'm egyptian i have a green card i have been living in the us since 1991 i have a very common arabic name i'm married non american but non egyptian non arab wife i have children who are born in the us i have a phd in cell biology from the us and i travel for conferences i make 6 figure income and i own a home in the washington dc area i pay my taxes and outside 1 or 2 parking tickets i have no blemish on my record since i came to this country in 1991 i look more egyptian than the character but my spoken english is as good as his br br a couple of months ago i was returning from a conference company business in spain through munich germany to washington dc home i was picked up in munich airport by a german officer as soon as i got off the madrid plane he was waiting for me he was about to start interrogating me until i simply told him i have no business in germany i'm just passing through he had let me go with the utmost disappointment that was nothing compared to what happened at washington airport which was not nearly as bad as what happened to in the movie the customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the length and purpose of my trip he then wrote a letter c on my custom declaration form and let me go after i picked up my checked bag i was stopped at the last exit point some homeland security crap i sat there for 3 hours along with many different people of many different nationalities i was not told the reason for my i was not allowed to use my phone or any other phone i was feisty at first asking to be told of the reason or let me go but decided to suck it up and just wait and see i asked if i can call my wife to tell her that i'm going to be late but was told no when i tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said hello an officer yanked the phone out of hand and threatened me to it when i asked about needing to call home because my family is waiting they said three hours is nothing we will make contact after 5 hours when i asked to use the bathroom an officer accompanied me there it toilet was funny i guess it was a prison style toilet that is all metal with no toilet seat finally they called my name and gave me my passport green card and said you can go i asked what the problem was they said nothing i know it was only 3 hours but i was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids br br as for the movie it was very well made unlike most movies that involve arabs and use non arab actors who just speak gibberish this movie the arabic was 100 correct i assume the country is morocco north africa
<START> everything about choose connor was top drawer especially the script and the very proficient work done by the 21 year old director writer producer luke a talented young man from whom to expect great things all the acting was credible the dialogue smart the theme important loved it br br saw it at the 2007 woodstock film festival where it was screened twice and went over tremendously with the audiences it's more than just a coming of age movie this kid learns a hard heartbreaking lesson about trust politics and the system how things really work to suit the personal agendas of those in powerful positions br br i would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain
<START> this was an absolute disgrace the worst dramatisation i have ever seen german officer's with a spotless english accent they didn't even attempt to be german how were we supposed to take them seriously garbage garbage garbage leave the german acting to the likes of ralph fiennes liam neeson in future
<START> the cover case and the premise that write there is so promising as slasher maniac i expect much from this but what the heck is going on the movie is awful the direction the plot the suspense and the act of the casts is so amateurish i even thought that they are using a home video camera to shot it lucky that it still manage to deliver some good moments to me that make me have to like it thanks for the bad package of so called camp blood br br 1 10
<START> in this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of images of abu ghraib or tales of forced at guantanamo bay gavin hood's rendition is about as up to the minute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream hollywood it's not by any stretch of the imagination a perfect film but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum br br the term rendition refers to the ability of the cia to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time all without due process of law anwar el is an egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the united states he has an american wife a young son and a new baby on the way he seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist yet one day without warning or explanation anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that anwar claims to know nothing about br br on the negative side rendition falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character the ostensible focal point is douglas freeman a rookie cia agent who is brought in to observe interrogation at the hands of egyptian officials the problem is that as conceived by writer kelley sane and enacted by jake gyllenhaal freeman seems too much of a naÃ¯ve boy scout to make for a very plausible agent and he isn't given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character we know little about him at the beginning and even less it seems at the end he goes through the motions but we learn precious little about the man within thus without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams with story elements flying off in all directions a similar problem occurs with distraught wife played by reese witherspoon a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface gyllenhaal and witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances br br what makes rendition an ultimately powerful film however is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie's closing stretches it may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject but hey this is hollywood after all and the film has to pay some deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted let alone see the light of day as a completed project br br two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film omar who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken and who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator torturer meryl streep alan arkin and peter sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of dion br br does the movie oversimplify the issues probably does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces most definitely one wonders how the movie would have played if anwar really were a terrorist yet the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground it isn't afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes it openly ponders the issue of just how does a nation hold fast to its hard won principle of civil liberties for all in the face of terrorism and fear and just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say enough is enough even at the risk of being branded terrorist appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power the movie also does not in any way deny the reality of extreme islamic terrorism br br thus to reject rendition out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good rendition may not be perfect but it is good and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live and that alone makes it very much worth seeing
<START> it is really a shame that imdb doesn't let you give negative votes this is the most hideously awful show ever foisted on the american public by our usually likable neighbors to the north the parents are a and a neurotic hag he is as charming as a well used fire with the same hygiene standards she is a wax museum mannequin programmed with more neuroses than the entire cast of the view the kids are non entities if female and repulsive beyond belief if male especially the title character the boy is a serious contender for most insanely smug self satisfied arrogant and vain male character on disney which is saying something this show was obviously conceived as the anti brady bunch but it comes off as the anti christ and why is the photography so dark
