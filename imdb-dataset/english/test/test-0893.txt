<START> five fingers relies heavily on barbaric shock value hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie going response this is where this movie fails throughout primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously i was repulsed and disgusted that five fingers was even made and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it torture in and of itself is gruesome even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome but obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough it had to go way beyond what was needed and simply and effectively ruined any chances this movie had of making some sort of valid point for this reason this movie came across as nothing more than being self gratifying five fingers also pretty much relegates itself to a b movie status solely by its indulgence on manipulation of time in other words we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in snippets this is a little bit of a twist of the normal hollywood manipulation of time whereas the viewer normally is shown page 95 in a 100 page script as the beginning of the movie and then the rest of the flick is essentially explaining the ending five fingers is dedicated to flashing back which gets quite tiring by the end of the movie overall five fingers made me feel stupid for watching the whole movie because torture is obviously obscene and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to make this point i am surprised that dick cheney did not make a guest cameo appearance at the end as some sort of torture superhero this movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy mindless dolts
<START> i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago perhaps the long wait was worth it since the criterion collection dvd restoration is impressive br br in its outline this movie follows the time worn script a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault the heist takes place a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all even though the heist footage is transfixing it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film this film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on giving us two movies for the price of one br br john plays the idea man tony le always referred to as le with such world weariness that he could have just stepped out of a camus novel tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists re entering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex lover who has taken up with another man where as punishment he physically whips her with a belt thankfully that scene occurs off camera but you are not likely to forget it after that sobering event since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship tony meets with two of his old partners in crime jo and mario and decides to join them in one last big heist they enlist the services of cesar an italian safe cracker played by director dassin himself and we are off to the heist br br the heist goes off without a hitch but womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned however we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film br br it is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and his family in fact jo's son refers to him as uncle i think it is partly to help jo's family that tony agrees to the heist the ending scenes where tony saves the life of jo's kidnapped son partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions but only partially
<START> i found it hard to care about these characters who were either annoying or insipid all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives br br the dialogue was at times and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow was it me or were entire scenes deleted br br it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film the stereotypes and jokes about men's groups would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s as it is this is where much of the humour of the film comes from and boy does it get old fast br br apart from the attractive irish man this film was a dud and not even in a so bad it's good way the last 20 minutes were particularly painful perhaps if you've never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before then this film might have something meaningful to say otherwise darlings you'd still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing
<START> i've often heard people express disappointment that tempest has little to do with shakespeare's original in my opinion that is both true and false but most of all it's a bad starting point for offering critique a work of art should never be criticised for what it isn't but for what it is the movie tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to shakespeare's work in spirit what tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time no not experimental as in hand held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings tempest is epic sad realistic joyous full of life but most of all it is imaginative cassavetes portrayal of philip prospero is in itself worth a 10 10 rating and when you add gena rowlands susan sarandon a wonderfully deep molly ringwald raul julia the dialogue the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture i rest my case one of the best movies of the 80's don't miss it
<START> whether or not this adaptation of the marvel comic was made Â and shelved Â so its production company could retain the copyright to the characters it doesn't change the fact that it's utter rubbish the dr doom and especially thing costumes are surprisingly good but everything else suffers from a deficit of either cash or talent director can't even point a camera at stuff without including such howlers as a blind woman's pov the dialogue is absolutely dismal the team's costumes don't fit properly and the effects are appalling the human torch seems to be drawn onto the film with felt tip pens while mr powers are brought to life using a bendy blue stick with a glove on the end joseph culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms about jay underwood is incredibly annoying the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible and while it's hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a release it's equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was actually any good
<START> this film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites castle freak himself is a good monster i would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me however the movie had some dumb parts about it br br a husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter i suppose death is a greater damage than blindness but you'd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind all they care about is that j j 's dead while their teenage daughter walks around running into things and talking about how she'll never be able to drive a car the parents are like honey stop walking around without a guide you know better than that and then they cry and don't ever stop being depressed because jj's dead sounds like favortism to me br br the lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done for example when a giant crash is heard in the castle everybody runs down into the basement to see what it was it was a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered the husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and plainly says the mirror broke i don't know i would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castle br br the husband and wife have some major relationship problems and it's funny to watch how dumb they are with each other no one ever believes the blind girl advice if a blind girl says she hears things believe her and don't tell her to shut up i think this is the moral of the story listen to people when they tell you things or else you might end up killing yourself to prove your point br br lastly i thought the best character was the main police officer he was the best actor and character everyone else besides castle freak was pretty run of the mill 3 10
<START> great balls of fire is the movie you show to someone you really really hate it is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract info from captured intelligence agents i've enjoyed some of dennis quaid's performances in the past but he goes totally over the top in this film he doesn't so much cross the line he pole vaults over it then comes back to jump over and over again he struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip it's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful was he desperate to win a golden raspberry or some other award for bad acting that's the only conclusion i can come up with thank you dennis you gave us a bad performance for the ages where was the director to reign in this guy br br the opposite end of the extreme is winona ryder she of the plastic features and plastic acting i came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy that was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of jerry's underage cousin wife this brings up the film's mixed up message that being it is 100 okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union i fail to see what is so okay about that but it looks as though hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory talk about family values br br another problem is the format is it a forward re telling of lewis' life or is it a musical i'm not talking about the music i'm talking about the truly weird scene where jerry drives up to the school starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was broadway musical in search of a tony fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work but who really cares i don't and neither should you you can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film so don't waste your time it's too precious for something this misguided and poor
<START> you belong to me was the final teaming of henry fonda and barbara stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for fonda to columbia pictures fonda had signed a contract with 20th century fox in order to get the tom part in the grapes of wrath but after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at fox br br but the rule was broken here though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to charles pike from the lady eve this film isn't anywhere near as funny in fact feminists would probably be aghast at it br br in fact barbara stanwyck herself didn't like it at all she liked working with henry fonda right enough but thought this film was ridiculous as well she should have br br fonda is another millionaire playboy who we would now call a trust fund baby who doesn't really do much with his life he's sort of lovable lunkhead who meets stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls for her trying to show off turns out she's a doctor and they have a whirlwind courtship and get married br br but it turns out fonda has a jealous streak especially when it involves roger clark another millionaire patient of stanwyck's and he's not understanding as to her professional obligations br br stanwyck like bette davis and katharine hepburn was and is a feminist icon when she tells fonda that he ought to go out in the working world and live on a salary and see if he can do it fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store she's so proud of him that she actually is going to give up her medical practice and live with him on his salesman's salary br br today now would be the film stanwyck did not have too much conviction in her performance probably because she didn't believe any of it i certainly couldn't br br i don't think even back then audiences believed it either but the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best but this one was a thanksgiving special
<START> this film was both entertaining and thought provoking i'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged great acting directing and it is canadian to boot it is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers the locations in ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era with so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick for any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle be it financial or illness this film strikes a resounding chord it approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way without cheaply capitalizing on all the and supernatural themes that have become staples in hollywood and the tv networks
<START> despite of all the negative criticism i really enjoyed this movie i am not saying this lightly i love movies and am fairly picky about them my home dvd collection is over 9 000 movies some are great others are ok a few i do not like at all and to all those with criticisms this is a comedy i simply love this movie it is light funny and very restful i am aware of all or most of the deficiencies but i love it the comedic talents of eddie murphy and robert deniro are tapped fully for this type of movie do not compare it to other movies with these star actors simply enjoy it the cast is great and i believe that the purpose of this movie was fully accomplished if you want a really easy going and very restful night watch this movie deniro and murphy simply had fun making this movie so should we watching it and please do not be so negative do not expect godfather performance or meet the parents from deniro do not expect comedy blockbusters performance from murphy it is a completely different genre and it made me relax after a hard day work your sides may not split from laughter but it is still very funny
<START> zombie planet seems like an example of good ideas and laudable ambition budget i thought the explanation for the zombies was real original and gnarly and loved the dog munching in the exposition scene the rest of the gore was effective in a low budget kinda way but too spaced apart throughout the movie the problem was that it was too long and anti climatic sure they had a intriguing if derivative plot line and a similarly familiar but cool setting but a low budget zombie film really needs to be to make an impression and there just weren't enough red moments in this for me i think there was surplus of cheap looking and bloodless fight scenes as well especially given the generally minimal grue plus for a two hour movie there's very little closure at the end and though it kinda makes me want to track down zombie planet 2 i felt a tad cheated so probably most worth looking for the two of them
<START> rajkumar santoshi tries his hands at comedy and succeeds one of the few good movies that involves salman khan a very funny movie from start to finish all the characters contribute to the movie and believe me there are a lot of them aamir khan salman khan raveena tandon karishma kapoor paresh rawal viju verma shakti kapoor harish patel tiku talsania and more the direction editing sound are not up to par but that still does not matter because the actors more than make up for that part
<START> 1st watched 7 29 2001 4 out of 10 dir mark fast paced frantic animation effort by ted turner's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains i'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to disney efforts like aladdin and lion king don't let this fool you there is no comparison in story or quality
<START> the only thing i expected that this film didn't have was an intelligent talking motorcycle br br this film is just plain awful i gave it 1 star which of course means i enjoyed it tremendously bad acting bad writing bad directing bad fight choreography the only real actor in this movie is martin landau who of course does a good job playing the villain although the character is your standard cardboard cutout evil ceo villain even the so called plot twist at the end was no shock br br there was so much to make fun of in this movie i enjoyed it a lot and it did have a few impressive car wreck stunts br br like bad movies check this one out ouch want a good movie not here
<START> the dvd release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of sandra bullock her picture from years after this film basically is the cover art and the back cover art and the inside cover art the same picture her name is prominently shown on the front cover all 4 edges and the disk itself she is the first name in the list of stars her biography is printed inside the case this film must revolve around her character right wrong it is her first movie and she plays a minor role after watching the movie every role seems like a minor role the character dog actually displays some personality less than an hour after watching it i don't even remember the names of many characters br br maybe if i watched it several more times i could actually figure out the plot but i don't think it would be worth the effort br br oh wait i just remembered a funny bit shoot em up video game fans will get a kick out of the doom cam looks just like a first person shooter game hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera br br i am generally not a person to be critical of movies but this may be the worst movie i have ever seen i kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen sit down and start making fun of it br br i'm just glad that the money we spent on this used went to charity
