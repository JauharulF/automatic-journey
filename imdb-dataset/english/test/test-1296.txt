<START> minor spoilers br br first i must say how rare and charming it is to find a movie with such basic messages in it nuclear war will inevitably destroy all of civilization and women are for making babies it is absolutely incredible how well formulated the plot is to hit in these two points as with a golden hammer essentially everything about this movie annoyed me the casual sexism the character whose sole trait was coming from texas the mysterious choice of dying mars orange and of course the flawed science of it all then the martian woman screaming as if she had just noticed that she was blind what was that however i will give it credit the fifties did spit out some sillier things but not much
<START> recent years have seen a number of biopics of famous singers and ray the story of ray charles has much in common with walk the line which was made the following year and told the story of johnny cash cash and charles were near exact contemporaries both being born in the early thirties and dying in 2003 04 both grew up in poverty in the american deep south both lost a brother in an accident during childhood both achieved success in the 1950s both experienced problems in their marriages and both were addicted to drugs all these matters are emphasised in both films there are also similarities with ron howard's a beautiful mind although that film was about a mathematician rather than a musician it like both ray and walk the line stressed the part played by its subject's wife in helping her husband to overcome his problems br br ray charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in georgia in 1930 his original name was raymond charles robinson but when he was starting his career as a musician he dropped his surname to avoid confusion with the boxer sugar ray robinson in some ways charles had an even harder time than did cash having to cope with two additional disadvantages in the shape of his blindness and of the racism which affected all black americans especially in the south during his lifetime charles had a particularly traumatic childhood witnessing the death of his younger brother george in a drowning accident and going blind about a year or two later he appears to have been haunted by nightmares and feelings of guilt over george's death throughout his life br br the first half of the film is rather slow moving and is a standard rags to riches showbiz biopic telling the story of how the young charles is taught to play the piano becomes a nightclub performer and then rises to fame as a major artist falling in love along the way with the beautiful della bea the best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to charles's childhood there is an effective recurrent image of coloured glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind there is also a memorable scene in which the teenaged charles shames a prejudiced bus driver into letting him on the bus by pretending to have lost his sight on omaha beach in reality he would only have been thirteen at the time of the normandy landings br br the second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory focusing on charles's drug addiction the problems in his marriage caused by his affair with margie one of his backing singers and his battles against racism in the early sixties charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in georgia although contrary to what is stated in the film this did not result in his being banned from performing in the state he also fought against racial divides within the music industry itself performing not only traditionally black styles of music such as gospel and rhythm and blues but also traditionally white ones such as country and western regarded by many black americans as the music of choice of the redneck community br br as peter bradshaw film critic of the guardian noted ray is a sunny film which turns away from the darker side of things it omits any mention of such matters as the death of charles's beloved mother aretha during his teenage years his brief marriage to eileen williams in the early fifties and his eventual divorce from della bea in 1977 it also plays down the extent of his womanising and the number of his illegitimate children there are similarities here with a beautiful mind which also omitted a number of controversial details about its subject's personal life including a divorce br br fans of ray charles will no doubt enjoy the film for the music but it is worth watching even for those who do not know much about him chiefly on account of jamie foxx's oscar winning performance in the title role reproducing charles's mannerisms so exactly that we think we actually are watching a blind man even though foxx himself is sighted unlike joaquin phoenix in walk the line however foxx did not do his own singing doubtless charles's distinctive singing voice was too difficult to reproduce he receives good support from some of the other performers particularly sharon warren as aretha and kerry washington as della bea the film is uneven and overlong but nevertheless rewarding 7 10
<START> the title role of this western is played by robert walker jr he's a young gun who with partner david carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a mexican general in eluding their pursuers carradine and walker become separated walker comes upon the camp of lawman robert mitchum who takes a liking to walker and makes him a protÃ©gÃ© and reclamation project of sorts br br this is the first of two films robert mitchum did with writer director burt kennedy the second was the more humorous the good guys and the bad guys br br not that young billy young does not have its moments of hilarity but it is a story involving the walker reclamation mitchum's hunt for the bad who killed his son and a romantic triangle involving mitchum angie dickinson and town boss jack kelly br br the film abounds with nepotism david carradine is john's son dean martin's daughter deana is in this walker is the son of robert walker and jennifer jones and mitchum's son chris plays mitchum's son in some silent flashbacks br br robert mitchum got his start in westerns and always looks right at home in them angie dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in rio bravo walker had a brief career playing rebellious youths and doing a good job at it i've often wondered what happened to him he looks hauntingly like his father maybe he didn't want to come to such a tragic early end like his father br br and it that wasn't enough mitchum fans get to hear old eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film
<START> i'm out of words to describe the beauty of the cranes are flying but i'll try anyway to write about it it's a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the second world war it's the classic story of lovers boris veronika separated by the war and of what comes between them the film's images are so gorgeous that you'll be carried away the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotion br br there are few scenes that portray directly the war a bombing wind lightnings explosions that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist veronika who waits for the return of boris and there's another scene on the front where we we will be confronted by a emotional visual hurricane showing the images played in boris' mind another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title the cranes flying in the sky this image stands as a the symbol for nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film not to give up hope and fight for a better future br br is a great director this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply it is not just pure technique br br is perfect as veronika what more can i say the film transcends the time it was made the action takes place during the second world war but it could have happened anytime anywhere as long there are wars great or small the film and its message will remain relevant
<START> the story line of a man's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered valley girl who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives what a great and worthy story line but in this telling the screen writing and or directing and or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story linda hamilton's character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a speeding bullet and for what purpose conflict conflict conflict at the drop of a hat katie the california girl and her boyfriend mom and everybody including the poor lady at the airport check in counter lin's adopted father who is the nicest most considerate man alive and his wife and biological son all in constant conflict i really wanted to enjoy a heartwarming story but the only thing that made me smile was when all the hate and fighting were over there were too many unexplained or illogical events many of which don't add to the story my wife and i kept looking at each other and asking ourselves how such a good cast and what should be a great story could be crapped up so badly
<START> i don't care what anyone else says this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film what was john landis thinking br br i know it's based on a series of children's books but c'mon even kids hate this movie it's pointless and boring tom arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money br br i think the only reason the hasn't appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage at least hobgoblins made it on mst3k
<START> eaten alive follows a young woman janet who searches for her lost sister turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of borneo with vietnam veteran mark at her side she sets off to find her sister br br as per usual the acting isn't of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl me me lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare female lead janet covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things now that's gotta count for something br br but i must say that i find it bit hard to recommend this title if you are fan of the genre you will most likely recognize every gore scene in the movie bar a select few and i mean that literally a lot of the gore scenes are lifted straight out other cannibal movies like man from deep river and last cannibal world there's probably more movies stuck in there br br ultimately this is one for die hard fans to check off their list if you haven't seen any italian jungle movies you'd be better off watching cannibal holocaust and if you're an avid fan you have seen most of the gore scenes in other movies
<START> a western through and through as the title character portrayed by glenn ford says no i don't want to fight but i will if it's forced on me this movie is about being intelligent strong and fighting for one's beliefs with courage never stop striving for what you feel is right great action and mostly quick paced good to see brian keith in this role and edward g robinson as an older western man glenn ford lives up to his western image thoroughly enjoyable film includes strategic non military warfare of course it's violent like the title states but not too graphic like in the computer generated era films it's mostly about strong personality clashes
<START> i just finished watching this movie and largely found it a waste of time with little or no redeeming factors i really don't understand where all the positive reviews came from the animation is clunky and unrefined the plot makes no sense at all from an objective standpoint and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in that which is trying to pass itself off as an intriguing and suspenseful film i have never read the book so i can't say if the movie was faithful but as with most movie adaptations it tries too hard to cram as much information into the shortest amount of time possible the result is a disjointed and illogical storyline that doesn't really let you understand or relate to the characters or actually anything at all overall i felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point where i couldn't bring myself to care about what happened to them and the only way i can see how this animation could be considered beautiful is if your normal standard of animation is a scooby doo cartoon
<START> i was so looking forward to seeing this at the film festival in sydney i left the theater like many others before the end credits because i couldn't sit through it any longer it was badly shot the sound sucks and the acting was worse than an episode of the love boat now i know why this film hasn't been able to find an american distribution company to release it in the united states this screams of a low budget high school production
<START> to keep from being bored during love and sex first i tried to think of all the movies this was of breaking up with russell crowe and salma hayek though that had a more original ending about last night with rob lowe and a lot of tv shows br br second was admiring just how gorgeous janssen is so i couldn't believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date she is certainly in line to give julia roberts a run for her money literally and wasn't julia in some movie with this same plot or other br br third was trying to figure out why the writer director bothered to give jon character the jewish name of adam levy he even refers to eating a ham sandwich br br fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why i was in the theater br br originally written 9 2 2000
<START> david master of debonair niven plays the big boss ivan who preys upon the unfortunate richard jordan pinky by forcing the hapless ex con to exploit his ill found new position in a bank elke sommer miss pelham most effectively provides the female interest whom pinkie cannot simply cannot resist br br it seems they were unable to decide on one name for this film so instead they used four makes sense br br sadly this turn out to be one of niven's last roles br br overall this film is fun and well worth watching if you manage to catch one of its rare or late night tv screenings br br
<START> a virtual carbon copy of the cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot i knew the movie was going downhill when i saw the fake campfire lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors the conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence the acting wasn't as bad as the typical b movie and there was some believability in their fear but as professional they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession overall not worth wasting 4 50 to rent
<START> the two leads an englishman and an aussie filming an american civil war story in romania have not the slightest spark between them are utterly unbelievable as lovers and wholly unsympathetic there is no story no characterization virtually nothing to keep the eyelids separated during this interminable bore fest renee also hopelessly miscast practically chews the fence posts but at least watching her embarrass herself provides some comic relief nicole kidman is a decade too old for the role and has not the slightest idea what's going on jude law's moron role could have been played equally as well by any of the romanian extras the only requirement is to wander about the forest looking stupid while watching a parade of guest stars steal the show not that it mattered because all of the guest star roles were completely unnecessary as they did not advance the so called plot by one iota and as if all that wasn't enough the auteur felt it necessary to throw in some spinning whirling kung fu jumping off horses what was that about
