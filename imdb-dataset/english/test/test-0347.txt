<START> i was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out commercials for it made it look quirky and i generally like morgan freeman and chris rock and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea sadly i was terribly disappointed with nurse betty br br personally i've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully in my opinion are tarantino and the there isn't that much violence in nurse betty but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when i was supposed to laugh of course for me part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where i was being asked to br br the film doesn't much work as a drama either renee betty the story's protagonist is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way i will say zellweger acts the role quite well and freeman rock and greg kinnear all do good jobs too the problem is in the writing freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character it's really too bad 3 10
<START> this film tells the stories of several couples coping with post wwii life through many moving accounts the audience learns how the war has changed people while their human spirit went on to triumph br br my favorite scene is where a young service man who returned home as a double amputee after losing both arms up to the elbow is sure that he would be no good to his sweetheart who still wants to marry him his girl simply said that she would help him with the things he wouldn't be able to do but that they would be fine together moved by this true demonstration of love the man embraces his fiancÃ©e in tears br br the scene where a service man asked for a bank loan is also a highlight when he is initially refused as a high risk a higher ranking bank official takes over saying you fought for our country and kept us safe that's good enough for me your loan is approved the best years of our lives won 6 oscars including a special statuette for the disabled actor who showed us all that life goes on and will continue to be worth living even with a severe handicap this film is a joy to watch over and over again a true classic highly recommended
<START> br br there is something about seeing a movie in a good old fashioned movie house that adds enormous appeal to every picture i fortunately enough was able to see at film forum in new york city a pair of ernst lubitsch comedies during their three week tribute to the legendary director the double feature i attended was a screening of lubitsch's 1938 comedy eighth wife and the pre code classic design for living neither of which i had seen before everything i read of design for living praised the film but i could not find a good review anywhere for eighth wife leonard maltin disliked it too gave the comedy a low rating its imdb score was not complimentary and pauline kael not a great surprise blasted the film in her scathing review so when i went into the city that day i was expecting to enjoy eighth wife only slightly and love design for living completely eighth wife which was showing first began as the eccentrics who populate the cinema took their seats and the thirties music subsided adolph zukor presents claudette colbert and gary cooper in ernst lubitsch's eighth wife ' the title card read then the picture opened with a hilarious scene cooper wants to buy a pair of tops but he doesn't want any part of the bottoms he gets into a squabble with the clerk who seeks the help of his higher bosses and their seems to be no end to the argument enter claudette colbert one of thirties cinema's most beautiful charming and talented personalities i'll take the bottom ' she kindly intercedes and there you have perhaps screwball comedies finest meet cute' ever the film kept my interest wonderfully i found myself laughing almost constantly when colbert discovers just before a family portrait is taken that her groom to be has been married seven times the entire theatre broke into when she bargains for money immediately after she gets over her shock the laughs which still haven't ceased intensify and edward everett horton milked some hilarious reactions out of the script as well when cooper takes inspiration from shakespeare's the taming of the shrew in disciplining his wife by slapping her in the face i could not control my laughter when she slapped him back and the drunk scene with the is one of claudette colbert's funniest comic scenes the greatest comic moment of the film came when colbert a boxer to teach her husband a lesson ' in pure screwball fashion he knocks out the wrong man instead putting her friend david niven into a cold sleep he awakes as cooper is arriving in order to cover up the situation colbert herself in a moment of strong sexiness puts her fist up to niven asks where did that man hit you here right here right here ' and then bam knocks him out again the film was wonderful from beginning to end it was a perfect delight i loved design for living too though i dare say i think for sheer laughs and entertainment eighth wife was the better and more enjoyable film there is some charm of seeing a vintage film on the large screen and in the presence of others laughing one feels more comfortable doing so himself that is perhaps why i felt the way i did about eighth wife
<START> as most other reviewers seem to agree this adaptation of 'after the is very good indeed always one of my favourite poirot stories i was worried that it might be about with' well it was a little bit but only a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining david suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as poirot and as others have pointed out the other star of this show is monica dolan who surely could not be bettered as miss gilchrist i also really enjoyed fiona who was spot on as the cutting rosamund shane but really the casting was quite impeccable throughout br br one point is knocked off for the not being able to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes the business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although i didn't mind how they tightened up the structure of the family in the book the family tree is really quite complicated the final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and i found the very end when they all leave quite touching this is really one of the very best of the poirot series so far
<START> after i've seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie i'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times but in it's genre it is a great movie i know not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'robin is turned into a comedy many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with they are wrong br br mel brooks has done an excellent job with robin hood men in tights i have seen the original robin hood movies as well but i never had such a good time when watching them as i had with this one it's just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies winston the godfather br br i recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie to those who think robin hood shouldn't be messed with you're wrong but you better don't watch it because you'll probably be offended by it i give this movie an 8 10
<START> this film just doesn't work no two ways about it i saw it for the first time back in '98 when it was released and i didn't like it i just bought it on sale a couple of days ago 'cause i thought hell i'll give it a try i don't regret for the money i put out for hamilton but the fact remained the same this movie is pointless dull and uninteresting br br stormare is usually a delight but that's when he's making films in the us back home he doesn't do the trick sure the movie is well made if you forget the odd stock footage but in the end the only thing that really lifts hamilton above one star garbage is hamill's turn as the bad guy hawkins he seriously has fun with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments in the movie swedish intelligence huh now there's a contradiction in terms and when he allows hamilton to have a word or two with his wife over the phone towards the end of the flick and that's really pretty much it br br
<START> spoilers ahead this same exact plot from this movie has been done before it has been done in ferris bueller's day off bat man houston plays sick his gullible parents believe him his sister knows that he's faking but she still must go to school she is mad he has a party with his friends while his parents are away by the time his parents get home he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party i like immature better when they were in house party 3 and still immature
<START> i can't imagine why it hasn't been theatrically released yet it's got a great ensemble cast with sutherland lane and especially chris evans doing spectacular work wake up studio execs br br the story is based upon the experiences of the author screenwriter growing up as the poor kid in an extremely affluent community where class is everything and makes a difference in every aspect of life from clothing to justice br br during the film's q a the author was asked about his experiences and particularly what we don't know about the ultra rich he said they aren't stupid they're very smart as opposed to how they may portray themselves they've got plans and they are a threat br br in many ways this film is extremely timely
<START> the film version of came out two years after the television series ended like many fans i duly went along to the cinema when it opened i came away bitterly disappointed eric could not have spent very much time writing the script most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes at the time of the film's release the series was still being repeated regularly on i t v so the public was being asked to pay to see something they'd seen already at least the 'on the movies boasted original screenplays br br secondly richard beckinsale had died the year before so they eliminated the character of as a mark of respect substituting art student 'john' played by christopher of 'only when i fame it simply wasn't the same br br as another poster has pointed out boarding house looked nothing like the one used in the series being bigger and altogether cleaner br br director joe mcgrath was one of the directors who worked on the original 'casino royale' a film steeped in surreal humour also has its share of 'walter style fantasy sequences such as the 'saturday night parody personally i found them horribly out of place a case of 'over egging the br br on the plus side leonard is as magnificent as ever as the seedy as are frances de la tour as and don as its just a shame the film isn't worthy of their talents br br when died in 1984 it was shown by i t v as a tribute with its final scene showing laying prostrate at the foot of the stairs removed in the interests of good taste
<START> i am a big fan of the 1995 version which i have seen many times and consider a subtle excellent film this 1971 version i bought yesterday a bit hesitantly but now that i have seen it i am glad i did because it is truer to the book and to austen's insights the 1995 version has more dramatic power largely because it sharpens many of the characters in the 1995 version lady russell is more manipulative less truly looking out for anne sir walter is even more vain and vapid elizabeth is nastier mary is more insufferable mr elliot is more smarmy lady dalrymple is much more stupid but i think the characterizations in this 1971 version are closer to the book to austen's vision and to the real people of the time the 1971 version also includes more of the key lines and scenes from the book including especially the key scene in the field where anne overhears wentworth talking to louisa or is it henrietta about the importance of strength of character i found the acting more subtle and evocative than do many of the critics here but the acting in the 1995 version is more powerful i agree with the critics here that the actress who plays anne is too old for the part i looked up her entry on imdb and she was 38 at the time of the filming when her character is supposed to be 28 i thought her acting was subtle and effective however wentworth is of the correct age and i found him very convincing in particular this 1971 version of wentworth has much more of his sense of humor and teasing the 1995 one much more of the sense of power a sea captain would have and more passion the admiral in the 1971 version lacks the gruff presence and human warmth of the one in the 1995 version and lacks any feeling of the power an admiral certainly would convey i found him the one truly weak element in the production i agree with others that the staging of the falling scene was too wooden and it seemed unconvincing that she would have been so injured by such a little fall however it could be that she banged the back of her head on the edge of the stone step which if so really would produce a very dangerous injury and would make the scene more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version where she falls farther but is clear of any sharp edge that could plausibly cause a major head injury as to the costuming that some have criticized i am no expert and can't respond but i will note that none of the navy characters wentworth admiral croft in the 1971 version wear their uniforms while in the 1995 version all of them consistently wear their fancy uniforms i suspect that the 1971 version is the accurate one and it always bothered me a bit in the 1995 version the officers being always in uniform when clearly the nation is at peace and the officers are detached from active duty my father and grandfather were career us navy captains who commanded aircraft carriers and submarines and they did not spend every day while on leave or at leisure in their dress blues i doubt it was any different 180 years ago the uniforms give the 1995 version a lot of zing and i prefer it but i doubt it is accurate historically that these officers wore their uniforms so frequently lastly it is true the production values of the 1971 version are a lot less than the 1995 version but given the year 1971 the tv format and the budget we can't blame the artists for it contemporary viewers who can make a mental allowance for the lower production values can find this version well worth their time
<START> despite the fact that this was a made for tv movie and an obvious one at that ie cheap looking class warfare left me wishing i could get my money back and considering this lame production was partially funded through canadian dollars i might just be entitled br br what made me sit through it in the first place was seeing actress lindsey who i've watched for the last couple years in her role as goody goody mara lewis on the soap opera guiding light taking a turn at playing the bad girl for a change br br surprisingly she does quite well as kristen a spoiled rich b tch who suddenly finds herself dirt poor but with a conniving streak and a twist of fate that will possibly change her fortunes back around the twist of fate is provided in the character of richard robin dunne a socially radical outcast who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to winning 23 million on a lottery ticket now put richard kristen her jock boyfriend jason wade carpenter and their camcorder obsessed mutual buddy graham dave together for the weekend in a remote cabin cut off from the world by storms and just guess what unfolds br br the film suffers from both the story and and motives too much everyone is pretty one dimensional and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that some things and some people are going to go very bad very quickly i don't think this is that original a plot and it doesn't go out of it's way to make itself anything more the acting is ok is spot on as the manipulative female lead and dunne is very good perhaps a little too good at times but no one else is worth writing home about the only other real credit i can give the film is the one twist i didn't see coming towards the end not the very end though that one is so obvious it hurts regardless i sat through all of it and lived to tell the tale so i can't say it was a complete write off br br 4 10 a something to watch when nothing else is on type movie
<START> this was recommended to me by a friend that said it was cute and cuddly for a lesbian sexuality flick boy was he wrong i guess he just didn't get it growing up not understanding and then discovering yourself thru trial and tribulation is more like it br br the characters are full and vibrant and the story has enough fun thrown in thru the theater performances to keep anyone interested br br rachael stirling as nan goes thru so many tries at finding the love she desires only to find it was the one person she was scared to reveal all too and ran out on may as flo was remarkable spent a couple hours trying to recall where i've seen her before only to discover she was the quiet sister alice in last of the mohicans luckily i was raised in a liberal family and had no issues with trying a movie like this so many people are missing out on flicks like this i'm glad i took my friend's advise and tried it but i'm sure i enjoyed it more the he
<START> i remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of suspense and twists it grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie i have thought about this movie for the past several years and have checked in video stores to see if it's available but was never able to find it or anyone who had even heard of it i think this type of movie is timeless and i know it would be enjoyed by a whole new generation of movie watchers i hope this gets on video soon as it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did back in the early 70's br br it's very rare that a tv movie can make that much of an impression but this was did and still does after so many years
<START> the opening was a steal from eight legged freaks a film that is everything this one isn't stilted and pedestrian are the words that apply along with others that can't be repeated drifter type returns to his home town meets up with old friends etc the usual annoying kid single mother local loudmouth and so on bad special effects alien ship atmospheric disturbances hey didn't the director see close encounters good acting good story good camera angles good cutting not here do not rent unless you are sharing the cost and have a lot of beer handy do not watch on tv go and drink a lot of beer instead you'll enjoy it more
<START> i know i know it's difficult if not paradoxical for there to be such a thing as believable fantasy but to me there is also such a condition wherein too much unbelievability with or distracts from my overall opinion of the movie the latter was the case for me with regard to goliath awaits not only did i have too many unanswered questions concerning the storyline but some of the acting too i thought was a bit over the top maybe though it was the writing asking them to recite too many trite predictable cliched over reactions others have said enough about the plot i just wish that it was done and i think that it could have been more convincingly p s this is a fresh comment about this film i just finished watching it a couple of minutes ago not a recollection from years ago
