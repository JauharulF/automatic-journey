<START> my friend and i rented this movie for 3 99 at blockbuster if i'd have known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be i wouldn't have paid a cent i had no warning for this bs the acting can't even be called acting the inevitable sex scene is awkward and you can tell that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it and the male villain god who couldn't tell he was going to attack emily and the musical cues my lord this movie makes me want to cry never rent this in fact if you happen to look upon it gauge out your eyeballs this movie isn't of god it's from hell i'm just gonna take the last couple lines to write blah blah blah cause i really don't want to continue on with this review
<START> was really looking forward to seeing a continuation of lonesome dove but this was total garbage cinematography was terrible shot way too tight was almost viewing the grand canyon through a stationary telescope editing was cut cut cut not even smooth more like a bad student editor don't know if did the screen play but the dialog was terrible really like val kilmer's portrayal of doc holiday in wyatt earp but what in heck was he doing with this character in comanche moon i have no idea even looked like it was shot on a sound stage using the old bonanza sets how can the director of the original lonesome dove gone so wrong with this where was his head can't say much for the acting either it's a shame to have messed up such a beautiful western that could have been but more like they rushed this one just to get it in the can have read other reviews and see that others felt the same way not even curious to watch the next few nights cause it would be just a waste of time like the first night was br br 2nd post ok since nothing else was on tv i must be honest and admit that i watched the last 2 nights of comanche moon and i will be honest to tell you that i didn't make it to the end of either of the last 2 episodes because i fell asleep i can only admit that i was watching the two main characters very closely and i could pick out some mannerisms that steve did while portraying the character that duval did such an excellent job with so i must give credit for that as for karl portrayal simple dead meat can only say again that i was very disappointed only because i cared so much for the original ld and like others have defended my feelings for a truly great western
<START> i usually really like lawrence and being in australia i haven't seen much of his stand up so when i saw this at my video shop i thought yeah i'll have a look i wish i hadn't seen it now obviously lawrence had a profound experience that opened up his mind and i guess he wants to share this with others but this was neither the time nor the place br br this whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell it really did i believe the catch phrase of the night was ride it until the wheels fall off which he intermingled with just plain lewd jokes revolving around sex and sexual organs br br don't get me wrong i don't mind crude humor but lawrence lacks the gift of classing it up in the fashion of eddie murphy richard prior or robin williams lawrence was just plain lewd the only time i laughed was when he relived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital if there were minus points i would give them
<START> this film took up three hours including commercials on the history international channel last night but it felt like three weeks it wasn't the cheap stagy and unintentionally funny depictions of the bombing of dresden it wasn't that the film is stripped of almost all context surrounding world war ii it wasn't even that the bombing itself was often made to appear as nothing more than a major inconvenience for a goofy love story no it was the wooden featureless characterizations that sucked the life out of the story oh and the fact that if it is possible for a movie to be obsequious then dresden is that movie perhaps a better title would have been dresden as uriah heep would have experienced it br br it is especially the latter point that so irritates was the bombing of dresden a war crime the makers of this movie believe so but in the typically emasculated way that germans have come to approach world war ii they can't bring themselves to say so without braying about peace and no more wars anywhere like they're mother teresa and also typical of german towards the british in particular there is an unwieldy effort to grovel before britishness while loading all the guilt for dresden on to one person arthur harris br br did i say one person well not quite at the beginning of the movie there is an exclamation from the leading character anna with whom we are all supposed to sympathize damned americans she screams while watching as far off bombs fall and a few minutes later a radio voice intones warnings about the american terror bombing being inflicted upon germans br br note the word terror got that it's really the americans behind the inhumane targeting of german civilians no matter that the american strategy for almost all the war in europe was the precision bombing of industrial and war manufacturing sites no matter that it was the british who enthusiastically adopted area bombing of civilian targets in germany before the germans had themselves even targeted english ones no matter that the americans bombed during the day suffering more casualties in the process than the british in order to hit precision targets while the british bombed civilians under the cover of night no matter that the americans essentially were brought into the true terror bombing campaign kicking and screaming against it no matter that most american officials from fdr to gen dolittle opposed targeting civilians while churchill and his generals couldn't wait to do so br br no in dresden both the germans and british except for bomber harris are innocent of a doctrine it is intimated created by the evil americans and only the might and power of a love story between a german nurse and a downed british bomber pilot can adequately explain the truth of the atrocity right br br oh by the way for the younger and likely less well read readers of imdb the first and still so far only major literary effort to give a thoughtful voice to bombing was the pacifist novel penned by kurt vonnegut an american pow in dresden at the time of the bombing i guess germany's couldn't find a pretty nurse for billy pilgrim
<START> rossini once described rival composer wagner's work as having some wonderful moments and some awful quarter hours inuyasha it seems can also be described this way it has many great episodes but in between them are countless filler episodes the entire series consists of about 175 episodes of which i'd say at least 125 are filler or some sort of subplot i didn't bother to count and i wouldn't be surprised if that number were in fact higher though br br some of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable though many are quite silly or dull nonetheless the constant digressions start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing at a labored crawl for most of the series character development too slows down greatly and by the later seasons the cast has become quite resulting in increasingly stale jokes particularly those concerning the monk who's ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly br br however all of that isn't to say that inuyasha is a bad series it just isn't a great series the way neon genesis evangelion for example is generally considered to be as something to watch at the end of a hard day it is nice but it could never be confused with high art
<START> based on a joke once told by jim wynorski that's what i've read at the end of the closing credits well mr wynorski gotta have an awful sense of humour then this film is terrible really i loved the first two chapters of the slumber party massacre series the third film was quite useless but completely watchable compared to this piece of crap there's not even a driller killer and the plot the acting the characters the locations the events everything is boring absurd and laughable the only good reason to watch this turkey are the girls if this film were a porn i think it would have worked really much better the film lacks gore too the first scene the one in the tent could be bloodier and the scene with the headless guy knocking at the door lasted one second some moments of slight thrilling can't save a nonexistent plot buzzy lunk johnson seems to be the only real actor here i found him the only bearable character in this movie oh there's a nonsense part with brinke stevens who performed linda in the first slumber party massacre the police bother her to know more details about the killer but what we get is only some footage from the first film not a dialogue neither a monologue or anything from this still traumatized grown up girl who's forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life as she says giving us no clues at all about the murderer br br watch at your own risk
<START> why i disliked the movie apart from the sheer ugliness of the actors themselves is that someone might actually believe such crap br br first of all the second coming of christ will be at the end of words and when jesus christ will come on judgement day he will not come as he did before in human form he will come in his full glory as god and we shall be judged not only for our sins but also for the consequences of our actions everyone will secondly i have seen the eternal gay pride illustrated in this movie with the all unquestionable i read the bible last night and it's not written anywhere well it is moses cites on 3 different occasions that men who make love to other men or women who make love to each other as if man and wife should be killed because these will never inherit the kingdom of god as they are foul if it truly were for us to follow the bible word for word there would be executions now wouldn't there but i think misinforming people does more harm than this would that was the in the old testament br br there are lots of lunatics in psychiatric wards who think they are the son of god but to make a movie after it truly makes you think of how many idiots out there can make a movie
<START> i was reticent to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here why firstly because mick humour can in my humble opinion be pretty crass and over the top evidenced by his ill fated of a television show some years back and secondly because good aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the tiger br br sensibly mick has restrained his natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie who would have thought that a bowls club would provide the setting for one of the funniest australian films in years the cast is excellent with familiar local old timers all putting in believable performances br br interesting to see john clarke playing the villain in this piece it's a one dimensional part but jc still adds a touch of class as always good to see judith lucy also getting a guernsey or should i saw bowls uniform on the big screen she's a real talent pity a number of her retorts were expletives her own material is a lot wittier interesting character though bowls reporter on a local rag how low on the journalist food chain can one get br br crackerjack may not be the funniest film i've seen this year but it's certainly an enjoyable diversion well worth a look lots of other people obviously agree with me as it's headed to be the biggest grossing australian film this year good to see someone finally make a quirky gentle comedy without trying to sledgehammer the laughs like so many australian 'comedies' before it br br finally a bit of trivia if you're wondering which aussie rules team mick supports check out the flag on his also look out for his old partner in crime tony martin doing the announcing in the final bowls scene br br br br
<START> for reasons i cannot begin to fathom dr lorenzo cameron george zucco begins injecting wolf's blood into his dim witted handyman glenn strange the result Â is transformed into a hideous as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be killer beast dr cameron uses to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas and why wouldn't they dr cameron's nuttier than a fruitcake br br overall the mad monster is one dull and poorly made poverty row thriller there's really only one positive i can come up with to write about in the mad monster george zucco can be fun to watch as he plays the mad scientist about as well as anyone his dr cameron is a regular loony he has no qualms about killing he has entire conversations with people who aren't there and as with most mad scientists he messes in god's domain actually i'm not sure anyone accuses him of this but it fits but beyond zucco there's nothing here to recommend everything else from the monster effects to the supporting cast to the music is plain old bad there are far better examples of poverty row horror from the 1940s than the mad monster
<START> the mayor of hell has the feel of an early dead end kids film but with a much harder edge and very few light spots preceding the first appearance of the dead enders by four years james cagney has a full screen opening credit even though technically the of the movie's title is actually portrayed by frankie darro one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes character is jimmy smith a young tough who's befriended by gargan cagney and is elected to the position when gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory br br warner brothers made a lot of these types of films attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty this movie is quite gritty with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school the rules at the reformatory are simple enough work hard and keep your mouth shut step out of line and you answer personally to warden thompson dudley digges br br cagney's role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory on the outside he's still nominally in control of a criminal racket the film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this br br warner brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled crime school featuring humphrey bogart in the cagney role and billy halop in the frankie darro part if you're partial to the dead end kids you'll probably like the latter film better since it also offers familiar faces like leo gorcey huntz hall bobby jordan and gabriel dell however the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too with bogart's warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters in madge evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for cagney's character br br curiously a lot of james cagney's early films aren't commercially available so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on turner classics or source the film from a private collector personally i can't get enough of this kind of stuff and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the thirties and forties
<START> dumb is right tom and jerry reach their goal of a non stop air flight to africa but then worry about mixing in with the natives they put on blackface crash the plane try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean and then survive the wild animals once they get on land br br having read a few reviews before seeing this i knew what to expect it was simply these two guys doing their amos and andy fetchit impressions offensive to blacks of course but that's the 1930s for you some of their lines were funny some were stupid the main fault i had with this cartoon was the audio as it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying br br in all a curiosity piece but don't let the racism stop you from checking it out at least it gives you an idea of how times have changed for the better
<START> i'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here first is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read and may not ever read the book the second is from someone who has br br movie without book from a movie standpoint it was an okay movie nowhere near as good as either of the underworlds but much better than and i'm not just talking plot line either the visual effects were iffy in many of the parts though the wolf transformation was very nice the characters has very little development and vivian didn't even seem to truly care that her love was killing off what was left of her species some of the other characters could have had more air time like the five the plot was way to similar to underworld for my tastes br br movie with book as many have stated other than the title character names and a few minor parts the movie and the book are nothing alike in the movie gabriel was a lot older and was the father of rafe thus astrid was once his mate in the book gab was about 24 never mated with anyone since wolves mate for life astrid is trying to win his affection and astrid was the mother of not rafe another important thing is the location the book took place in maryland also why they moved from west virginia is very different the movie has it being fault and her entire family was killed due to it in the book the original leader of the five named axel killed a girl from their school hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them father included forcing them to move also mom was a major character br br one thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been the dance for those who don't know it's the ordeal where all the bitches females of the pack fight to see who is the one to be the mate of the new leader since earlier there was a fight for the males vivian won it trying to save her mother from astrid who is a horrid evil woman in the book and thus was supposed to mate with gab there was no prophecy anyway if you've read the book and you liked the book i highly suggest not seeing this film
<START> i saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie br br that is something that i have not done since i have never fallen asleep at the movies br br i love the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone this may have been the problem but i do not think so because there were a couple of bright spots that showed if done right they could have made this movie work br br bette was under used and anne was over used and miscast br br i do not know why english or anyone for that matter let this go out in that condition br br they billed this as a sex in the city but better not a chance i liked sex in the city a lot and was disappointed by this movie br br so do not waste your money on this movie go see anything but this
<START> this movie is so unreal french movies like these are just waste of time why watch this movie even i did not know why what the well known sex scene of half siblings although the sex scene is so real and explicit but the story it is based upon is so unreal what is the use of it then can you find easily in life half sibling doing such things br br did i learn something from this movie yeah some people are just so fond of wasting time making such movies such stories such non sense but for those who like nihilism nothingness in life or simply a life without hope then there you are you've got to see this movie br br only one worth adoring though catherine deneuve she's such a strikingly beautiful woman
<START> this is one of those films that you watch with a group of people you will have the best time it's really really bad like showgirls bad but without the quality of showgirls br br you've got the best mix of bad actors bad director and bad script here everything that can possible be wrong that can make for an entertaining evening you have here the first being the tag line is a bunch of teenagers these people are as much teenagers as my grandmother br br the director has zero sense of suspense or tension the 30 year old teenagers are standing around and the monster comes out and attacks and this pretty much happens throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed there is no suspense building up to this or surprise or anything it's more like when you were kids pretending to be chased by monsters and just kind of made up stuff as you went and when i use the word monsters i exaggerate more like a couple guys in halloween masks bought at the 99 cent store br br there is no doubt this script was spun off in a couple days no rewrites and i can only imagine how bad and poorly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no clue it's another example of one of the bad things about this day and age anyone can make a movie br br but of course the best bad thing about this film is the acting it's as bad as you can get there isn't one person in this who has the slightest skill at acting and the lead is the absolute worst he delivers every line in this monotone manner without any expression and you have to wonder how someone this bad could possible get a part in any movie no matter who he knows when he had to cry when his girlfriend was killed it was one of the funniest scenes i've ever seen in a movie watching these people reciting some of the awful dialog is very very funny but when the black guy said tell her tell her i love her before his death scene there was a huge laugh among our group funny funny stuff br br my only hope is this movie gets bad enough ratings to take its place where it belongs in the imdb lowest rating 100 movies we can do it folks br br ps is it any surprise that the one great comment this movie got in here was from someone in virginia who has one comment only on this movie and nothing else and guess where the movie was made virginia i've said it before and i'll say it again people who work on the movie should not be allowed to comment on it
