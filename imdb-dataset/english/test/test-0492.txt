<START> as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time second only to the breakfast club the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time it's underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people it comes on tbs maybe once a year but sometimes longer the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time i've never heard this many great songs in one movie before there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin hes in high school who has a couple of best friends his two friends are sex teens the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures that are very funny gary is major in love with the new girl in school he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her he also cheats on the side you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much you can feel it even more in the second half gary's friend turns out to be a creep but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be you can relate to a lot of this movie the plot sounds like your teen sex comedy but it's so much more than that it's a very honest movie it's also very 80ish which i love if you love the 80's or grew up in the 80's rent this movie but there may be some people that don't like the 80's but still may like this movie i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think it's very entertaining and very funny it combines very touching moments with very funny moments it's an underrated gem i have the movie i love it i give the last american virgin 1 2 out of
<START> pretty good movie about a man and his wife who get caught up in murder and the police officer investigating the case it starts off marvelously but kind of hits a wall at a certain point we're sure we know what happened then a tiny plot thread that seems at first like a red herring pops back up and disappoints still clouzot's direction is great and the acting is quite good louis jouvet who also co starred in marcel carnÃ©'s drÃ´le de gives the best performance as the clever detective i wonder if the coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote fargo much like that film the police officer doesn't appear until nearly halfway through and then he becomes almost the focus of the film there's also a lot of droll comedy surrounding him although sometimes his methods seem sort of fascist
<START> a time to kill is based on john grisham's first novel the one he wrote before he was famous and the one that didn't skyrocket him to fame that would be accomplished by the firm that's why this movie didn't get made until much later after grisham was off churning out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head unlike most of those this book was actually about something it had meat it had weight and it had heart br br but it also had a fatal flaw and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie namely a time to kill sets you up br br here we have a black man jackson on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10 year old daughter we have an underdog lawyer mcconaughey battling the big bad system to save his client and oh by the way the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in mississippi complete with hooded kkk men burning crosses br br in other words we're supposed to sympathize with carl lee we're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her we're supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime we're supposed feel like we're standing alongside the people chanting free carl lee br br but the racism issue is a smokescreen and the whole thing is contrived carl lee was a vigilante yes there were mitigating circumstances for what he did but the fact remains that he wasn't innocent this would have been true no matter what his skin colour or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter the judge the jury or anyone else br br and what's so heavy handed about this film is that it paints anyone who believes carl lee should have been convicted is a racist the message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldn't be taken into people's own hands then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood br br this isn't the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this and it won't be the last as a movie a time to kill stays pretty faithful to the book and the acting isn't half bad but it played the hand it had been dealt really even a good cast can't elevate bad source material
<START> first of all just let me say this ghost story hello br br if any of the other people who trashed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact their reviews would have been very different the fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look should have been a dead giveaway this movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store not even a hint and that is the biggest mistake that was made by the studio who marketed it it was deliberate on their part not to market it as a ghost story in order to confuse you like the main character is confused as you try to make sense of it the problem in this is that they lost too many viewers the ghosts appeared too human and real without any of the usual telltale signs imagery or special effects that hollywood usually uses to let you know you are now seeing a ghost and that is what they were trying to do the main character does not know she is seeing ghosts and neither does the viewer now do you get it as long as you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts then you'll understand the movie and not be so irritated by what is perceived as major oversights in continuity or plot flaws br br i admit this being said it still was not a good movie just not as bad a just about everyone else made it out to be just understand if you plan on watching this movie everything you see ain't always what what you think it is 4 out of 10 for acting 3 for originality 5 for plot and 5 for scare factor though there was some gore and spooky moments still not a good movie just way misunderstood
<START> okay so i've read most of the reviews on this movie as well as comments left by visitors to this site and the feeling i get is that most people who wrote reviews really didn't like this movie that's why i'm writing now i represent the minority because i did i admit i went to see the movie because i am very impressed with ryan compelling abilities and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible he is an amazing actor that aside i wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me why because it's a whodunit where you know from the start and that's kind of unusual br br as the plot goes two teenage boys endeavour to commit the perfect crime because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly free the uninhibited and let's remember acting out of one's will the relationship between richard and justin was complex hinted at homosexuality and was brilliantly acted by ryan gosling and michael pitt gosling was the manipulating controlling smooth talker and pitt was the extremely book smart socially awkward outcast enter sandra bullock's character who it seems most people didn't particularly appreciate i think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a self glorification thing i didn't see that as the case here without cassie's personal history about the ex husband that nearly killed her who not surprisingly shared similar traits with richard hayward she never would have pursued her instincts about justin and richard the case was seemingly airtight against ray the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie neither bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other and the vomit justin left at the sight therein lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing the acting out of will as true freedom ' ended up working against justin who ended up having a conscience after all and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site without that crucial piece of evidence they almost had a murder by numbers and to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as i have i looked in to it and found that something done by numbers such as a painting suggests careful and critical planning and exacting there's also a song by sting called murder by numbers but that's beside the point br br many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between cassie and her partner but i think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her history like it or not her history does play an important role in this movie because without it she would likely have never followed her instincts about justin and richard yes it was a bit of the cliche women scorned woman acting out vendetta in every facet of her life' plot but i think without the depth of cassie's character you have just another movie about teenage killers and they just may have gotten away with it there's no movie there br br and to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didn't commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning can i remind you that the reason was because of the purposely placed and totally traceable shoe prints the boys wanted to be involved it was a game they were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth what they didn't expect was that cassie mayweather had an overactive case of instinct working on her side a little unbelievable maybe but many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts however this is a movie br br i saw this movie in theatres about three times and each time it revealed a little more to me and i liked it a little more the more i watched it the more i was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth richard hayward there are people really like this my main complaint about the movie would be that they should have had justin and richard's interactions a little more central because let's face it there lays the intrigue in the entire film and my main props go to characterization each character was very distinct and interesting in his her own way it was very well acted although i would have given ben chaplin's character a little more depth to work with he's a good actor and maybe pared down bullock's character a smidgen br br i think everyone should keep in mind that for a hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the whodunit at the beginning it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end i think they did so quite well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout slow revelation of the different character dynamics and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors ryan gosling and michael pitt i think if we remove our innate cynicism and attempt to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are we may be able to look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this movie if only in the characters who were brilliantly portrayed especially richard hayward not that i'm
<START> just how bad well compared to this movie cannibal holocaust is citizen kane there's the stilted acting the atrocious dialogue the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done unlike holocaust ferox is a straight forward movie it doesn't pretend to be a pseudo documentary in some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to holocaust's graininess unfortunately we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible they torture the natives and essentially bring everything that they get upon themselves there's really nothing in this film that makes it worth your while i was fairly lenient with my review of holocaust due to some actual attempt at a statement and style but in case there is no reason to watch this unless you solely get off on blood and gore
<START> snap crackle pop the jarring sound of every change in camera angle and that's not to mention the white flashes and the clipped endings to almost every spoken sentence what on earth were they up to in the editing room or could it be that this approach was intentional surely not what purpose could it serve despite all its technical short comings this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of joe a hustler determined to earn 200 for his wife's pregnant girl friend joe is outstanding as the easy going passive laid back young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the talking while he listens with a faraway look in his eyes br br the story is meagre and sketchy documenting the uncertain life led by a man who relies on casual street sex to support his young wife and baby one thing is certain joe is uninhibited when it comes to disrobing for sex or posing for an artist understandably so for he has a handsome face and and equally handsome body br br there is a scene in the film that is remarkably effective there is no sound no dialogue joe stark naked is crouching on the floor feeding crumbs of cake to his little baby there is a beautiful serenity and tenderness captured in these quiet moments br br another scene of amusing interest is the one in which joe desperately seeks a loan of 100 from a gym friend coming to the point of asking in a very circuitous approach br br joe tries to look interested but is hesitant in his conversation when an artist gives him a non stop resume of greek and roman art it's a preliminary to another occasion when joe himself of his clothes and poses as the discus thrower in true classical style br br at the end of the film we gain the impression that we have got to know joe pretty well after all he has uncovered more than his soul
<START> try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard pressed head is a masterpiece of non linear non structure surrealism and in less than 90 minutes it manages to be not only a time capsule of an era but also a full length experimental feature that defies time space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could head is a reflection of those films no matter how one feels about the monkees this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium had it not been for the film's unorthodox ad campaign and the fact that by the time it came out the monkees so the media that the public had become weary of them and every critic was ready to pounce on them this could have had a much greater impact studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than what's actually in the film and yet there are some great things in it great songs great cinematography etc should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because of it's overall dreamlike feel 1968 was a time of social unrest and a call for change thus the film's working title changes and head perfectly mirrors that time
<START> have to disagree with people saying that this is a lousy horror film with good acting and camera work i'd say it's an okay horror flick ruined by shockingly abysmal acting and poor camera work watch 'ju on the grudge instead of wasting your time with this garbage the principal idea behind the film is rather an original one considering the abundance of killer doll based scare fests which have been foist upon us over the years unfortunately the story is handled with all the subtlety of the latest michael bay actioner with a cast of characters which are uniformly unlikable and played with precision perfect by actors presumably from daytime korean soap operas it isn't scary and only succeeds in dampening your expectations of the next korean horror movie to come a calling oh well
<START> five fingers is so bad that i hardly know where to begin so let me admit first that i have only seen the first half hour when the first finger had been chopped off i thought sleeping a more useful activity i told my girlfriend the meaning of five fingers and she immediately followed my example br br couldn't the producer the director and or the scriptwriter consult a chess amateur like me they should have used a digital chess clock and not an this major goof makes the mental pressure put on just a laugh how when and why did date a moroccan girlfriend such an affair is very rare in the netherlands br br calling me a retard is of course an insult to all those people suffering with a much lower than average iq moreover as far as i know retards don't play chess i do br br the biggest problem is the script of course just compare the little intelligent movie hard candy to keep the spectator in a grip the information must be revealed bit by bit a nice twist now and then also helps i understood from other reviews that there is a big one at the end of the movie any smart person can guess what it is this of course just raises more questions why is the travel guide killed oh my why should i even care the whole movie focuses on just one thing the chopped fingers the makers have not even learned hitchcock's lesson it is thrilling to get a bomb exploded it is more thrilling to show that bomb ticking but no we don't see the paper cutter until the impossible countdown is over i will not waste more words on this crap go see hard candy
<START> according to the blurb on the back of the dvd case ross until a little bit of wee came out' i suspect that that has more to do with his being full of it br br i never watched the series for one reason or another so maybe i'm missing some essential cues as to this movie i watched the first 45 minutes or so i laughed once smiled once then reached for the newspaper whilst waiting for something else entertaining to happen nothing did br br evidently intended to be a surreal spoof upon life in the post python gross humour style this one falls absolutely flat there's been a host of comedy series on television in the last few years not the least of which were 'the fast show' 'the vicar of and 'father ted' each one engaging a group of bizarre but hilarious characters and sketches any one of these could knock this crap into a cocked hat br br if the series was anything like this movie i'm surprised they got the funding happily it was one of those Â£2 tub purchases and is now in the local charity shop br br the moral of the story is don't believe the pundits never pay top dollar
<START> ever wonder where that episode tuttle came from in the middle of the first season of m a s h well now the cat's out of the bag they got it from this soviet film a satire on how dumb the is due to the slip of a pen rendering the phrase the lieutenants though into lieutenant which has no meaning and nobody being honest or gutsy enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth doesn't exist and never did so they make up an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him off and 40 years later david and bruce shelly borrowed this zany plot and gave us essentially the same story only on the other side of what had become the cold war proving that people in high positions can be equally dumb no matter what their loyalties may be
<START> george sluizer of the vanishing fame he made both the haunting european original and the hollywood remake directed he shouldn't really be blamed for this confused poor movie because all the problems lie in brendan somers script it's ill focused and lazily written for instance the killer hangs around a nightclub waiting to pick up a victim any victim and starts talking to a teenage girl cut to the next scene where she tells the villain i've told you everything about myself tell me about your life unfortunately the girl has told the baddie her life story off screen and is a terrible example of the screenwriter not being able to bring a character to life through dialogue i know for a fact how bloody difficult this is but for a screenplay that is produced the writer should have tried harder br br it's difficult to explain the message of the film at some points it feels like it's trying to be a british natural born killers the media's voyeurism with crime perhaps it even influenced the infamous video game manhunt but the script isn't witty enough to carry this off when you've got a sex scene that doesn't progress the plot or characters or hint of subtext you know you've got a badly written screenplay and is a badly written screenplay
<START> although the plot of this film is a bit far fetched it is worth seeing just for the performances of michaels caine and the latter delivers a truly wonderful dublin accent caine hams it up which is exactly what the character he is playing should do entertaining and fun this is a hour and a half of easy watching
<START> no idea how this is rated as high as it is 5 8 at the time of writing but this movie was absolutely horrible the acting wasn't entirely bad but it really had no point whatsoever and the overall quality was poor its obviously a b movie or a c if such a thing exists and it looks like it was made over a weekend at a friends house or something im all for low budget movies and i generally watch any i come across but this one is really really bad i mean like the bad i don't know what else to say but trust in this as i have indeed sat thru this horrible horrible movie and i can save you the effort don't bother seriously just don't
