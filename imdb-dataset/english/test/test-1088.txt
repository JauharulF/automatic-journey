<START> i saw this at the 2004 stony brook film festival in ny and it was very warmly received in this pre ww2 film a pair of german rocket scientists are working on the scottish isle of as war looms on the horizon the characters encountered on the island are priceless in their creation and their portrayal macdonald is particularly memorable br br after getting up to speed on the accents the viewer feel right at home with these folk who watch with amusement as the germans work to link their isle with the mainland via a rocket based mail delivery as implausible as it seems this film was based on an actual story br br all in all a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting its story or its scenery
<START> i know a couple people who look just like the lead actress in this film or at least like the character she portrays they all give me the creeps and i would be the last person to ever lend one of them a gun or even a sharp knife she has one mean and ugly looking expression if you can conjure up a bit of sympathy for her let me know br br of course i might have the same expressions of concern and fear if i had an imaginary friend who had been killing off my real friends and acquaintances for the last 15 years br br and for our european friends on the imdb i'm saddened to say that yes some colleges and universities in the us teach courses on paranormal phenomena relying on the pathetic defense that it represents academic freedom and open inquiry br br this film is not worth your while you will have no sympathy for any of the characters except for aunt lydia who gets offed pretty early and the plot makes no sense
<START> jimmy stewart brings the story of charles lindbergh to life as he almost narrates the entire film while he crosses the atlantic it well edited with flashbacks over life franz waxman score is shear brilliant and truly gives the picture a heroic feel one of stewarts finest roles and this film can deliver time after time look for appearances by murray hamilton the mayor in the jaws movie as bud gurney comes out on dvd 8 15 06 with the release of a few more of stewarts classic films i consider jimmy stewart to be americas greatest actor and never tire of seeing him in any film i see watch this picture and you'll agree
<START> br br this movie is best enjoyed amidst a large audience with the giggle fits br br very frequently the characters in are seen staring ahead intensely at nothing very intense unhappy faces very pensive very serious during these moments there is very serious sounding music just to make sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games br br the more entertaining portions of this film come in between the many pensive stares we learn that the women of the community have two duties one is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands the second is to stay employed so to free their husbands from having to work what do these men do with their ample free time they pray and we learn that at home they pray out loud i give you thanks for not creating me as a woman and at their place of worship they pray to give thanks for possessing functioning male genitalia br br along with the praying there are many scenes of frenzied antics screaming and endless head bobbing and bodies rocking back and fourth and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre or simple but just as odd ritualistic activities br br the cream of the unintentional comedy comes from the sex the imagery of an hot and bothered man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed while attempting to keep his from falling off his scalp is unforgettable br br every sex scene is funny but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against his beautiful wife's feet oh yes we are finally entering the land of sensuality but no the feet rubbing stops before anything happens and the husband begins his autistic looking head bobbing and body rocking until the scene ends br br there are three attractive females in near states of undress however contains absolutely no nudity technically there is some interesting imagery and pleasing uses of light and colors by the director br br for a more believable educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being an unclean female unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed by which a man can cite a phrase from ancient writings i suggest barbra streisand's yentl br br
<START> i respect mike hodges and liked get carter immensely for it's bleak outlook but the just seems like a particularly dull itv drama br br the reserved cold acting isn't just the preserve of the lead character it's spread to the entire cast meaning there is nothing to contrast owen's character with br br none of the characters evoke any kind of feelings at all except boredom the ending of the film is also untidy at best br br the camera work etc is fairly good but if you want to see hodges best watch get carter don't bother with this uninteresting unimaginative through emotions he covered better 20 years ago
<START> if you don't mind subtitles you like comedy and truly interesting characters along with a taste of something different from mainstream american cinema then take a chance and rent this film br br two contrasting friends one very neurotic sweater the other the strong quiet loner type working for a jerk butcher in a smaller danish town decide to strike out on they're own together and open a butcher shop themselves not successful at first they incorporate something new to they're recipe and become an instant hit with the village br br that being an interesting story in itself this smartly humorous film is laced with even more friendship romance crime death personal tragedy that makes this film so funny yet riddled with numerous subtle interests that make it so interestingly funny yet warm and fuzzy br br a must mention is the characters created and the actors making them believable you can have the best script yet if the characters aren't believable it can sink a film and with this the directing acting character believability and story all mesh so well they make this a very entertaining film br br so if your in the mood to stretch a lil want to see something very good yet done a bit differently then i suggest you rent this film while i'm on my way out to find more by director writer anders thomas jensen
<START> there is a reason to call this a teen flick out of 100 possible points i would put it somewhere in the teens it is predictable the acting is horrible especially the minor roles and above all else it is super predictable the ending is so hokey that i should have left early and maybe it would have passed by the way could you call the male lead a pervert i bet if it really happened someone in my school district would have said so finally in the school i grew up in even though the average class had over 1000 students we could have picked out a chump like josie as being a fraud and we would have singled her out of the crowd my final word is save your time when it comes on tv watch something better like the stock quotes
<START> i described woody allen's manhattan as perfect to someone the other day and she thought that it was an odd way to describe a movie br br i have seen only a handful of movies that i would call perfect manhattan is one mccabe ms miller by robert altman is another and once upon a time in the west by sergio leone is also another film that i think achieves perfection there are a few others but aside from the fact that i find no faults in the three i mentioned i must also admit that all three directors are acquired tastes br br if there is one film that i could stand behind and bet the house that anyone i would show it to would find it flawless it's shoulder arms br br city lights the great dictator the gold rush and even the pawnshop are 10's but not only did chaplin do everything right in this film everything he did is hilarious and touching to a level beyond explanation
<START> yahoo serious is like a 3 bottle of wine had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age this film proves he is completely toxic we can only hope that this is his final film and that its serious lack of success will diminish his chances of obtaining finance for any future ventures it is right up there with lightning jack and les patterson saves the world as the most abysmal example of australian comedy imaginable how tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior comedic talents in australia yahoo is given such vehicles to express his brand of puerile school yard comedy and to think he had 7 years to come up with the script true genius
<START> i saw it in europe plex great movie br br this film is an exploration of the spirit and the flesh in modern times protagonist jim kirk drives an unwieldy rv across america stopping often to fill his gas guzzling tank he is middle aged and confused he fuels his thick diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter he is the flesh agitated and sometimes spaced out fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as of discomfort br br the spirit the film through speeches and other sounds as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field the spirit eventually collides with the flesh and kirk goes down unable to comprehend what has happened to him he's been in denial about just how bad things have become due to he of all of us because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh we're all in the same denial and so we like kirk are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert sands just like him
<START> this video was my first introduction to the residents and i couldn't stop playing it for the past three days the visuals are dynamite and more inventive and technically complex than any i have ever seen on the big screen or small br br the dvd loses points however for the pointless addition of new music the original residents music is unlike anything else you've ever heard and will really tweak your brain in the best possible way the new music however is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases is rather bad in comparison to some of the classic tracks also the uncompleted vileness fats video feels very incomplete and i could only fathom the plot of the story from extensive reading of the notes on the disc br br speaking of notes on the disc this dvd features lots of cool easter eggs that will probably appeal to long time fans of the residents hint look for icons on the notes pages that shouldn't be there br br from a technical standpoint the disc is one of the best dvd transfers available there is virtually no and only a little edginess in strong contrast points br br kudos for a top notch presentation this disc really deserves your attention
<START> half of the movie is is flashing lights and shaky camera the rest is made up of predictable characters think science vs government vs authority etc br br what is the worst aspect about this movie is it the cars being thrown around in the first 5 minutes is the horrible accent of the is it the uninspired characters the poorly integrated top 40 hits or the us will save the world vitriol no it's the fact that regardless of the sad ending there is very little suspense in this movie we basically know what's going to happen br br the one good part of this movie american components russian components all made in taiwan
<START> i have never been as surprised by a film that was this old only the treasure of the sierra madre holds up this well performance wise as someone that has seen heroin addiction first hand i was shocked at how realistic this film was frank sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising realistic and heart wrenching otto preminger's direction is perfect for the film with long takes and a very mobile camera br br kim novak's performance is good as is eleanor parker's in fact the entire supporting cast works very well with understated performances as befitting this film's style the documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date highly recommended br br 8 0 out of 10
<START> 1 i've seen hamlet branagh is too old speaks frequently with a high pitched voice unwillingly funny not a convincing hamlet and his directors qualities poor see also much ado about nothing from branagh the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts 2 i've seen hamlet 2000 i think the scenario is an interesting idea but such lousy actors all of them 3 orson welles hamlet is ok but this bbc hamlet is the best jacobi is convincing seems a bit of a lunatic very suitable and patric stewart wonderful and claire bloom is a very attractive queen you believe those actors what they are saying i think this is the best compliment
<START> i saw this drama by cable tv although i saw just two series i love this drama i'm waiting for more series will be aired by cable br br even though it describes horrible absurd situation in a camp this one shows us an indomitable spirit warmth friendship and humanity they don't know whether they can survive or not but kept their hope strongly without being discouraged by adversity br br i know this movie is not realistic like other war documentary but i don't want to blame for it it makes me believe the strong will of people in the most difficult situation br br 'private bill' especially this episode touched deep in my heart br br i remember every scene i always hate mathematics but after seeing this drama i can understand something about mathematics mathematics is his connection between past and present also symbolizes eternity br br 'time light and memory framed in a circle ' br br like other victims of war he lost his lover by irresistible fate i'm immersed in his time and memory as if i experienced same thing br br he experienced the great loss but he has pure passion of study br br he started his study in the camp his joy of realize br br i believe his dedication of study sustained him br br i saw it several times but the meaning of this film never faded every time i saw it i feel same deep emotion br br their songs are beautiful harmonious br br i'm sorry that i can't listen ost
