<START> i haven't seen this film for over 20 years but it had such an impact on me that i remember sitting through the credits and for several minutes after in complete awe this is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released i just ordered a copy of it on dvd and paid for overnight shipping and can't wait for it to arrive it is uplifting at times and also very dark and somewhat disturbing it's a story of a close knit band of regular kids growing up in the inner city and makes one feel as though they are actually sitting on the sidelines rather than watching on a movie screen or television hard to explain but it is something that must be experienced the story starts at childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters through high school and as they embark on their separate journeys in life the entire cast did an incredible job and it's by far the best work of jodi career i'm hoping that the dvd lives up to my memory and plan on watching it this friday with a good friend
<START> i liked this western starring randolph and glenn ford it's got pretty much everything a western should have there's gunfights action chases on horseback there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at there's some nice comic relief in the form of edgar buchanan who plays uncle willie mcleod a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool but is actually aware of everything going on randolph scott plays the town sheriff and glenn ford plays cheyenne rogers bill smith a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways i liked the different mix of characters in the movie i didn't find it always fast paced but i never found it boring either even though the movie is in 1943 it is in colour 8 10
<START> sometimes it's hard to define what separates a successful delightful comedy from one that falls flat in this case the contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who schemes to take her nieces away from the greenwich village who is raising them only to fall for him herself is not promising and nothing in director leigh jason's filmography suggests that he was an overlooked major talent and yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film br br he also had the good sense to cast this movie properly the one small flaw is miriam hopkins in a part that ginger rogers would have been perfect for hopkins is efficient but brittle lacking the warmth and sexiness rogers would have had she is further hampered by a pair of bizarrely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction but a very young and very handsome ray milland couldn't be better in an exuberant uninhibited comic performance of great charm br br and better than that particularly for new york city residents is the hollywood depiction of greenwich village in 1937 though completely synthetic and idealized it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer art director van nest created an amiable jumble of apartments and ramshackle shared that is the perfect backdrop for this picture's collection of artists smart alecks and wannabes best in the supporting cast is guinn williams bringing sweetness and light to his role as a prizefighter sculptor suggesting the self invention and fluidity sexual and otherwise of life in the village even more refreshing are betty and playing the little girls plain intelligent and full of humor these girls seem like real human beings and are nothing like the professional child actors of the time br br of special interest are a couple of memorable comic set pieces ray milland's vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than one expects the baby and his contortions are marvelous moments and a phony domestic 'play' in a department store window that degenerates into a free for all is also fun the movie slides slowly downhill with a straight faced custody trial and then never quite gets back on track when the action moves to long island but this movie is still worth a look
<START> the first two hours of the televised version are full of character and plot exposition after an early brief sequence of las vegas being hit by tornadoes the action doesn't really start until the second two hours still some character relationships don't become clear until the second part the actors turn in competent performances but nothing special however better than those in aftershock earthquake in new york an exception is randy quaid whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying the plot is a pretty standard mix of parts of independence day speed the day after tomorrow earthquake the towering inferno and several other films you can predict what will happen next and come close to predicting the dialog word for word the special effects are unbelievably bad despite the effects in twister the tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than the one in the wizard of oz and other effects were obviously done for less money than such series as csi and cold case spend on the totality of a single episode if you have to see a made for tv disaster film see the day after asteroid or special bulletin instead you'll get better plots acting and effects
<START> a very sensitive topic 15 y o girl abandoned by mother as a baby and who goes to visit her continues to be ignored is raped by her mom's boyfriend becomes pregnant there was not enough depth displayed of this situation too much of time is taken up on the chase with the truckers transporting the baby interesting this baby with asthma you never see him cry except once be fed have is diaper changed during the whole truck transport ordeal i would have liked to have seen more of the interrelationships more focus on the fact that this girl was a minor this should have stood up in court immediately br br and this was a true story it deserved a better telling than that br br if it weren't for the subject matter i would have given this closer to a 0 rating i rented this from the library only later i found out it was a made for tv movie br br oh well
<START> the first and far better of kevin kline's two gay roles the second is the dreary de lovely in which he played cole porter inspired by tom hanks' emotional acceptance speech for philadelphia in which he his high school drama teacher the nominated film in this version was obviously more forrest gump than philadelphia here the hanks character is played by matt dillon br br the reaction scenes in most of the film are very funny and as has been often pointed out are especially effective as done by kevin himself debbie reynolds tom selleck a brave move since he was himself the target of such rumors which he denied bob newhart and joan cusack as the eventually jilted bride to be br br tom hanks' actual teacher criticized the graduation scene saying people don't act that way in real life but this is a farce and not real life that being said it is not as effective as it might be and the misdirection of the final wedding scene which makes it look like tom and kevin are about to get hitched i found rather pointless annoying and a cop out br br the highlight of the film for me is of course kevin's scene with the how to be a real man audio tape and it is hilarious but certainly not at all realistic when the tape reacts to kevin's actions br br on the whole a hoot
<START> arising from characters previously developed in a series of much lauded shorts the curse of the were rabbit is about as far from run of the mill family fare as you can get beautifully crafted and with witty dialogue and clever concepts this really is a movie that will appeal to almost every member of the family br br the story concerns wallace and his dog gromit who live in a village obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and who operate anti a humane solution to all those pesky rabbits that torment passionate gardeners everywhere the business is a great success but wallace proves a bit too clever for his own good when he tries to rehabilitate rabbits from their vegetable crunching ways he unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary proportions the were rabbit and suddenly no vegetable in town is safe the movie is full of crazy inventions unexpectedly smart dialogue and references to everything from king kong to the wolf man more than enough to entice even a jaded teenager but the real charm of the thing is in its characters the amount of personality the artists and animators can wring from bits of clay is amazing they seem as fully alive as any flesh and blood actor the dvd release and i recommend the widescreen includes a number of informative and entertaining extras as well greatly recommended gft amazon reviewer
<START> is a classy filmed movie in the same style as the oscar winning film character 1997 but this comparison immediately urges me to add that the latter was quite more exciting br br sure is a beautiful historic costume drama with fantastic acting by in which you witness the personal growth of van in her marriage to the subtitle of this movie is 'a so it starts and ends with their marriage br br but that is where the director makes a crucial mistake exciting independent life started when the marriage ended she wrote several children's books and travelled around the world what a great life she has lived but puts back in the of convention that depressed her and that she struggled out of the thought that her life extended just her marriage to being no one else but the mother of their kids br br let's all hope for ii
<START> no redeeming features this film is rubbish its jokes don't begin to be funny the humour for children is pathetic and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next i couldn't enjoy the film at all although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again unlike with monsters inc finding nemo jungle book lion king etc which all get frequent requests for replays
<START> bizarre this movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer but everything that happens in this movie is fiction i guess it tries to explain why diane arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it her primary photography focus in the movie wolfman moves into the apartment above hers she seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him she puts her kids and husband second over the wolfman and even tries to incorporate him into her family gatherings some of the freak show side kicks come over to visit and she mingles with them the whole thing is very bizarre br br final verdict nothing memorable there is just something weird about a woman who gets her jollies from shaving the wolfman i think you can find better films out there
<START> on seeing this movie i didn't expect much i was delightfully surprised although the writing was unpolished as some of the dialog seemed drawn out and contrived the script did have shining moments my favorite line life is like a rich meringue an and i'm diabetic so i can't enjoy it the plot was new and refreshing as opposed to some of the newer more main stream horror that most of us are sadly growing used to i do believe some of the scenes could should have been longer and maybe some shorter the superfluous use of blood was campy but seemed to make sense in the end ah the end the end would have been a little better if they had explained why what happened happened i don't wanna spoil it it might have also added to the movie time which is in the area of it's only an hour long how good could it be answer quite good
<START> the protector you hear the name you think ah it's a crappy hong kong movie guess what it's not hong kong and yes it is crappy this amazingly stupid jackie chan film ruined by us yes us the americans i'm boiling with anger ooh i think i'll jump out that window has chan as a new york cop hunting down a gang avenging the death of his buddy sounds cool but it's not don't waste your money renting it to prove he could make a better cop film chan made the amazing police story 1985
<START> radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt in his heart was the right thing to do the viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done the adversity that coach jones and radio both faced was both tragic and predictable people did not understand nor did they want to understand but in the end the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature intuition compassion and love coach jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how it was sad the way coach jones and radio met the practical joke that terrified the life out of radio was enough to make you want to severely punish not only the boys involved but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it however on the positive side of the scale the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies this movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed ed harris was his usual brilliance gooding was flawless radio is an inspiration
<START> i had never read any of sarah waters' novels or watched tipping the velvet i only heard about when i was flipping through the l word websites the storyline of interested me yet i passed it away thinking lesbian in victorian period that never ends well i have enough of those lesbo series and movies that go no where br br however during christmas my local dvd store gave a discount i brought the dvd and my life has never been more colourful br br this mini series deserves to be cherished and praised the acting is so great that i call it rare sally hawkins elaine cassidy rupert evans imelda staunton and many more that i can't name all brought light and darkness to their characters just by a little gesture a little look a little touch they made their characters real and as a viewer i couldn't help it but take them home keep them close br br sets in victorian area is a story of sue a thief who loves and lives with her family of pick pockets little did she know that her fate is linked to maud lily a somewhat shy timid girl grows up in a mansion miles and miles away mother left her a fortune but maud herself can't touch it unless she married worst of all uncle makes sure she never will by keeping her in the house br br enter mr a charming good looking thief with a heart as bad as any he wants fortune for himself and in order to do so he sets sue up as maud lily's maid asking sue to persuade maud to elope with him as time goes by things would be simple if sue didn't fall in love with maud br br and things would be simple if the story was what i have just told i do not wish to spoil so i would like to stop there but i can you that everything is twisted and turned before you can even aware of what has happened once it happened you then question what would happen next on top of that the story is filled with passion unlike any others there are no self searching sexuality questioning oh my god do i like girls moments because the girls in are buried so deep in their own darkness that they barely be able to care the story with such twisted plot moves as smooth as water running passionately but strangely calm br br weeks have passed since i watched yet eyes still haunt me and sue's words still warm my heart you pearl you pearl you pearl she said and such pearl it is
<START> for only doing a few movies with his life the late great chris farley farley died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in tommy boy david spade from the lame police academy 4 spade really has done good with his career in films tommy boy is a classic and we will always remember chris farley when we watch it from appearing on saturday night live to doing tommy boy black sheep beverley hills ninja almost heroes billy madison and dirty work i think chris farley had a short and successful career tommy boy was his best in my case and i would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time thank you chris farley
