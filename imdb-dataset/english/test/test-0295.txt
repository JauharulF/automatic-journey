<START> and i'm so disappointed because i can't seem to buy the dvd or vhs of it anywhere br br its a kind of mix of uncle buck and the great outdoors and molly ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager this was made when molly was still a brunette just before she hit the big time with pretty in pink br br i'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy with an edge br br if anyone has a copy of this or knows where i can get one please leave a message for me it'll be much appreciated
<START> sweeney todd is in my opinion one of a few perfect musicals like my fair lady and west side story it has a wonderful intelligent score it offers the two leads and several supporting characters interesting roles it has a timeless theme revenge it has a good deal of humor and is just as powerful when presented simply or on a grand scale br br sweeney todd tells the story of a simply wronged man during the industrial period in england it shows mans' inhumanity to man how in sweeney's own words there are two kinds of men there's the one staying put in his proper place and the one with his foot in the other one's face in an effort to correct the wrong that was done to him mr todd devices a plan to seek revenge with the help of mrs lovett who owns a meat pie shop under mr todd's barbershop they set out to have those above serve those down below br br i was fortunate enough to have seen the original broadway version eight times six with and lansbury the other two with and i saw the revival with bob and beth fowler and several other concert versions br br while the technical aspects in this production are lacking to say the least i believe that this filmed production version is the best lansbury and were the two best in these roles and they have a wonderful time playing off of each other br br very good supporting work by ken jennings and edmund although betsy joslyn and cris as the young lovers have absolutely no chemistry and are basically unwatchable br br 9 out of 10
<START> tale about how the hell of the war can drive a sensible couple of musicians to the with many memorable scenes throughout the film i found particularly remarkable that close to the end where and von sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea a fascinating masterpiece
<START> this movie is just about as good as the first jackass but with slightly more disgusting skits i wouldn't say this was as good as the first but it came very close jackass fans will not be disappointed but if you didn't like the first movie you will hate this one there are scenes that will be seen as jackass classics the elderly suits with additions the cab ride and many others and those that you will wish you never watched eating crap drinking semen etc overall this movie was a good watch and i am glad i got to see it i'm sure this movie will not have the best rating due to critics that rate it i sat in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted but don't let that stop you from enjoying it
<START> tnt jackson isn't completely unwatchable but either the version i saw on dvd was edited with a weed whacker or the screenplay itself is the lowest level of grind house blaxploitation sausage or maybe both br br jeanne bell is supposed to have been a playmate at one point in her career and the movie makes the most of the connection by displaying her breasts at least two times more than was really necessary including a hilarious topless fight scene that i am pretty sure was meant to be funny i will admit they are quite nice still she's sort of average looking and doesn't have the charisma of a foxy brown of even a cleopatra jones she does have her moments as an actress in the film though but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a little harder or the screenplay had given her a chance to do more than emote attitude and kick people br br speaking of kicking people the fight scenes the other putative reason to watch a film like this are pretty poorly done there's no real choreography to speak of here just people posing and sticking feet and fists in the general direction of their opponents one minor exception is a nice moment with an opponent equipped with butterfly folding knives another is a sequence near the very end where an obvious stunt double for bell and maybe for stan shaw leap around and do some decent sweeps and groundwork for a minute or two before bell jackson punches her enemy's liver out shaw collapses and the screenplay just stops again i will admit that this is very much in the tradition of shaw brother quickies since time immemorial br br there are a couple of supporting actors who are actually better than the film deserves i'm thinking of joe and the fellow playing the drug lord's right hand man there's a halfway decent funk laden soundtrack that complements the action on the screen and add a star to the rating by itself there's a semi dodgy sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself br br this one is strictly for hardcore fans of blaxploitation i saw it out of sheer curiosity and i'm not sorry i took the time but i can't imagine wanting to take the time to see it again unless i decide to write a dissertation on the pop culture intersections of kung fu theater and foxy brown
<START> i would hope so and how can i get involved br br this movie is a classic and ripe with laughs adventure and an all star 80's cast br br what happens when you get together a group of jocks and a group of debating nerds a band of misfits and couple of br br a load of laughs that will have you begging for more br br david naughton stars as adam the leader of the yellow team a kind and hip college counselor who helps students with everything from getting the classes they want to first dates br br his nemesis is harold the leader of the blue team played hilariously by stephen furst of babylon 5 fame the no good son of a wealthy former college jock with enough trophies to make any hall of jealous br br pit these two against each other and throw in a red team a white team and a green team an unbelievable view at an observatory consequences of cheating at golf a super tour at the pabst blue ribbon beer factory and a hateful old landlady among other adventures and you have all the makings of a night to remember br br look for appearances by michael j fox eddie and director andy tennant in one of the last movies he acted in before becoming a director and you have an all star hilarious cast br br the only down side to this movie was debra performance as laura she terribly overacted but the rest of the movie is so good she can simply be ignored br br i own this movie and can never watch it enough br br
<START> a lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to china captures the amazement of film's first audiences pretty much as it's described to have been worldwide and uses actual lumiere films for most of the actualities i don't agree with other people about bad acting on the british fellow's part i thought he was fine but the chinese lead really stole the show in any case i found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie people who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in english which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the chinese on the dvd
<START> this is a well done action movie there are plenty of fight scenes the acting is convincing for this genre and is awesome i don't know why people feel compelled to trash i thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great the plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie br br having said that i must tell you richard sun is one of the worst actors from hong kong i have ever watched at least had the right idea by killing him now for all of you who thought sam lee alien was a bad actor he wasn't meant to be taken seriously i have just had the pleasure of watching gen x cops prequel and sam lee played the same character the same way br br now please all of you guys who watch highly reviewed oscar winners do not judge this is a thinking man's movie it isn't supposed to require thought just meant to be enjoyed that's all i hope they make another soon
<START> i'm generally not a fan of high school comedies they rely heavily on humor in bad taste and rarely stray far from clichÃ©d story lines and characters and downright dull dialog however i've had my share of guilty pleasures particularly when i was still in high school myself seeing the oh so recognizable teacher figures get their butts kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case these movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one this was not the case in especially not the protagonist of course it didn't help that the actor in play was one of the most irritating no talent arrogant kids i've ever seen in a comedy br br to act in a comedy is no joke it's hard to be funny the delivery has to be just right or the material goes to waste in this case there wasn't much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were half funny were screwed up professionally by the cast br br this movie felt 3 hours long the director never heard of pacing obviously stay away from this one there are many other enjoyable teen comedies out there such as 10 things i hate about you who's your daddy and superbad
<START> the lives of megan jackie and dylan shane elliott change in the nevada desert between reno and las vegas they stop to eat at a small greasy spoon where they reluctantly learn about the infamous area 51 by the cafÃ© proprietor jonathan breck after getting back on the road in their forty year old lincoln the radio gets a little crazy broadcasting hitler's speech at the 1836 olympics and then later a 1958 news bulletin of elvis presley being drafted into the military the car slowly breaks down and the two are in for the scare of their lives as mysterious unexplainable things happen in the lonely radiation poisoned desert remnants of nuclear testing megan meets a lost little girl channing nichols and a wounded wwii soldier the nightmarish journey doesn't end there is impressive to a degree and writer director james lay makes good use of patsy cline tunes all in all moderately interesting sci fi
<START> i enjoy the show surface very much the show is very entertaining and it's a clean show a show like surface is interesting it keeps my attention it has compassion and suspense i love all the cast members that are on the show they are all very good choices i think it is very important to have the right cast of any show because thats what makes any show a success and of course the scenes and the show itself television has changed so much over the years it has changed in good ways and in bad i love to watch some comedy action suspense and romance and scifi but surface is a show that i hope comes back for many seasons because it is a great show and its something that families can watch my children are grown but my husband and i enjoy watching these types of shows i appreciate your time and letting me comment my opinion br br thanks br br blackwell
<START> the not the best movie in the world that was an understatement i personally didn't like this movie at all not because of the story line not because of the graphic violence and the nudity the nudity didn't really need to be in it it did nothing for the story except maybe the girls were going through a rough time and being naked probably messed them up even more but one of the things in the movie that i hated was that it was sooooo dark you couldn't really make out what was going on i think if it wasn't as dark and you could see where they were then it might not have been so bad all you know that its a basement somewhere you see no house no road the killer in it all you could see was half his face for about 5 seconds i wanna see some stuff in a movie it gets boring after 20 mins of pretty much darkness and all you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall then you will hear the girl sobbing there was nothing that really stuck out to me that was good about the movie maybe the suspense in the first 10 mins of the film but not the suspense of how the movie is going to end but the suspense of will i get to see anything in this movie but a few naked bodies and various flashing lights but honestly people this was a saw meets blair witch project wannabe both top notch movies and both with the correct lighting to figure out what was going on forget this movie if you can see if your a blind person you might wanna rent it to hear the screams if your into that sort of thing but then again if you are blind your probably not reading this either so anyway bad movie
<START> a lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie but i feel this is only secondary it's really about living in japan and it really succeeds br br i spent a few years living in japan and i suppose the reason that this movie didn't do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced japan to get it i was watching this with a well travelled friend who's never been to japan and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ludicrous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief my reply was that those events were the absolute unvarnished truth about life in japan br br i think that this movie is definitely worth watching especially if you've lived in japan or are interested in it
<START> the story is incredible it begins with a new kid in town named roy while on the bus to school he notices a kid running with no shoes and on that same day he breaks the big bullies nose who is trying to fight with him roy soon discovers that kid is a runaway and he and his step sister are trying to mess a construction sight that could kill all the beautiful owls that live there roy decides to help them him there fight can they win this fight before the smart but bumbling cop dave luke wilson stumbles on to them an enjoyable film funny and adventurous i do admire luke wilson for taking this role i don't think his brother owen would even take this role
<START> i recently picked up all three robocop films in one box set rather cheaply and the only reason i did this was for the special edition of the superb first one i have seen robocop 2 before but not for 17 years the year it came out i have never watched it since because i can still remember how disappointed i was when i discovered how appalling it really is its a complete mess really it has all the signs of a troubled production with so many sub plots going on at the same time it has a very uneven tone also and it is also one of the nastiest films i have ever seen i don't mind a little violence the first one was incredibly violent but this one is just plain nasty also the sfx is terrible even for 1990 say hello to bad stop motion also having a drug dealing cursing kid as a villain is just a little too much peter weller at least had the common sense not to return for the next one the only positive thing i can say for this film is it does have a couple of nice gags like the thank you for not smoking one and the kiddie baseball team robbing an electrics store to quote the kid who plays the villain it sucks
