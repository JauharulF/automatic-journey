<START> i have not seen it since 1998 and yet i still can't get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find it so that shows what an impression it made br br just a wonderful story br br i just hope to see the stair at least once in person br br i didn't know much about mr petersen before this movie as i hadn't seen any of his previous works but his subtle acting in this impressed me and i think his portrayal of grissom on csi just shows more of the same he knows enough to let the character shine through instead of the actor shining through which makes him just that much better of an actor br br i can't remember enough about the poor accents to comment but i must say i have always enjoyed barbara hershey in all of her roles as well and i thought she also did a phenomenal job in this movie
<START> another decent offering from the pen of vince gilligan br br a pre malcolm in the middle bryan cranston plays patrick crump a deranged guy who eventually hijacks mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds it has something to do with his severe head ringing possible deadly combustion his wife just experienced it and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast only mulder could relate to this guy's plight and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed br br meanwhile scully seems to have solved the case with a possible remedy for mr crump and will meet them at the ocean check it out to see if our dynamic duo can hook up at the pacific and somehow rectify mr big problem
<START> very shortly a bad film if you are looking for pure action and no brain or brain or you are under 15 years old and like bruce willis this is the movie also don't expect the scenario to be consistent or even believeable if you think a little so don't if you just want to enjoy yourself
<START> i was an extra on this film but wish i wasn't because its rubbish the worst thing about this film is the music but the acting script editing directing and story are terrible as well the main reason its bad is because the budget is so low and the only way to make good film on a low budget is to have a good script the script which should have been ripped up before the film was made isn't funny i didn't laugh once what did make me laugh is how makers probably think the most important thing was getting the film made who cares if its total rubbish the film needed about million pound more budget and a better writer the only reason i didn't give the film one out of ten is because i felt sorry for the guy who is gonna lose a few hundred grand making this if you do go and see it just make sure your drunk at the time ha ha
<START> this is without a doubt one of neil simon's best plays turned movies it's full of great characters and memorable dialog johnathan silverman makes a great screen version of young eugene he was played by matthew broderick on stage this is the first of simon's autobiographical trilogy its followed by the wonderful blues and closes with the tv movie broadway bound if i had to say the movie has any flaws it would maybe be that characters sometimes usually speak in obvious dialog but that's alright because it's great dialog rent this little gem you won't be sorry
<START> you should never ever even consider to watch this movie it is absolutely awful this isn't an overstatement it is so unbelievable and exaggerated it gets boring it is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one they writer hasn't been able to pull it off in a good way br br if you'd like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you but still you should plug your ears and just watch it's not worth listening p there are so many great movies out there and if i could choose one this would be the last movie i would pick but all in all it's your choice br br enjoy
<START> an intense thriller about a mute movie make up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night after she tries to get away from the murder scene she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat
<START> a four and a half hour o'neill play gets boiled down to a little under two and much of that running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters' thoughts in voice over it can work onstage but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap opera adaptation which soft its heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men norma shearer and alexander kirkland overacting ludicrously are outclassed by a naturalistic clark gable he's the only one who makes the frozen face technique work it gets even funnier when shearer's and gable's son a surly moppet does the frozen face shtick there are also frank morgan's brother ralph as an unsuccessful suitor given to poor charlie over and over again and a young robert young and maureen o'sullivan by the time they show up the voice overs have largely been abandoned and it plays as a ripe soap with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays silver threads among the gold as background music robert leonard's direction is stodgy and he shows little facility for in hyperactive actors it's certainly entertaining there's nothing else like it unless you count groucho's satirical parody in animal crackers or an old mad magazine satire that rendered shirley booth's sitcom hazel a la strange interlude but it isn't good
<START> i really seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie but this was so awful i had to make an exception br br i am a scifi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on scifi that i genuinely like there just wasn't anything here to like br br i realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student but even considering that the sets and effect are bad the cinematography is mediocre but may be the best part of the movie br br the acting is bad a sad state when the female voice over for the computer is the best actor the dialogue is bad the script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent br br the humor is not just subtle and sublime it's nowhere to be found as an example a whole 20 minutes of the 80 minute film is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator br br this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's scifi to 2001 what we end up with though is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's scifi c movie at least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously
<START> i must have missed a part of this movie i found myself asking who is this and when did that happen it seemed to jump around but i kept watching for fear i was missing something and it would all be explained to me i loved lonesome dove but this movie made no sense to me at all i did love all the actors but what happened to the rest of the movie it made me go what at the beginning of each part as far as the scenery i thought it was fine it made me feel though like i was through a book and leaving pages out the ending had me a little confused too although i imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was meant to leave you wondering if his father would finally come home to his son and be a father since his mother was now gone i would like to read the book just to see what i missed in the movie i don't expect this one to win any awards
<START> first off i absolutely loved this movie as a billy crystal fan i must say that i was expecting more comedic situations than i actually got however it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion his portrayal of talent agent sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him in addition as maximus was superb in his first film role when sammy goes to romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down he never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life sammy and max's journey is unique and moving and even humorous at times plus the location in czech republic where parts of the film were shot was absolutely beautiful i have to say this dramatic comedy had me feeling a variety of emotions i thought it was excellent and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone
<START> br br well great costumes and a wonderful feel' for pre wwii italy but what happened here br br great actors kristin scott thomas sean penn anne bancroft james fox derek jacobi if you can't get memorable performances out of this a list' then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script i rented this on dvd after having liked angels insects 1995 also directed by philip haas br br i can hardly believe how dull this thing was it just dragged on and on and no one was able to save the poor thing this is not even a good intriguing foreign dudes and young things in pretty clothes chick flick br br tea with mussolini gone amuck br br
<START> what was i thinking when i rented this one what did the distributor think when he copied the tape and shipped it all the way to holland that anyone really wanted to see this s br br it's about some astronauts getting into trouble outer space apollo 13 flashback but never even in the shadow of this fine film and they want to return to home if you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible br br this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere deep impact and armageddon weren't perfect either far from it but they were at least worth watching once and maybe one more time when we're all old they gave some fun max q doesn't it gives irritation okay okay it's a tv movie but does that mean you're allowed to come up with such a mess br br if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time br br it gets at its worst at the end when the space shuttle lands on no i can't 'spoil' this one imdb guidelines forbid it so you have to see for yourself no don't see it sorry but rent a movie which is worth renting like battlefield earth just kidding br br probably the worst one i have ever seen
<START> it was foolishly with some degree of relish that i sat down to watch what a friend had promised would be the worst best movie experience of my life the mighty blade 2 years on and i'm still in therapy oh yes my dear friends it really is that bad they obviously got about 40 minutes of footage in the can and then decided to use said footage endlessly and repeatedly to brain numbing effect my only fear of the kind of post apocalyptic world featured in this turkey is that somehow some way a print of this abomination would survive truly the living would envy the dead
<START> we've all seen bad movies well this one takes the cake i've seen that junior movie box staring back at many times from my many journeys to the horror section at the local video store and i was a little interested it looks like it pays some homage to texas chainsaw massacre so i thought i'd get it mistake junior sucks hard long and with commitment in other words it's really bad although it does win my award for most creative use of a bikini top avoid
