<START> i recently saw episodes 1 4 and now i can't wait for 5 6 to be available i've heard they are coming soon log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy it's obvious that the budget was small but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident in fact the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more is a master of the put down i just wish i could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting co workers let's just say that if you don't like log i'll personally see to it that your undies get extra
<START> this movie was amazing from beginning to end the movie is packed with fun laughs music enjoyable rock music hot chicks more music action drama and the f bomb br br although some scenes are entirely bizarre and unfitting they were fun to watch and enjoyable all in all this movie left you feeling great and happy especially those that love rock music br br the soundtrack is great the laughs are plentiful and the storyline is simple entertaining yet complex you have to see this movie if you love rock music br br overall vote 10 out of 10
<START> my first 'columbo' rather enjoyed it great format and peter falk's character extremely good wonderfully quirky he can take his place next to poirot miss marple and also the likes of marlowe and rick diamond i can see why this series has such a following br br as a professional musician i have to say a few things first of all a conductor who merely produces these pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the repertoire eine kleine nachtmusik strauss waltzes beethoven is never going to have a house like that or fame like that or cars like that much less be called a genius and the conducting that the actor does is so bad as to be laughable no orchestra would take him seriously br br there are several little things too such as his rehearsal of eine kleine nachtmusik why rehearse it when they've just performed it for tv any orchestral musician would be able to play it in his or her sleep anyway his instructions to the ensemble are downright nonsensical and when columbo asks blythe danner what means she says it's it's italian as are the vast majority of musical instructions br br and finally no two great musicians would ever have the following play something what should i play chopin music is their job and passion they know it well something far more specific would be asked for and offered br br i know i should get out more
<START> i really liked the movie joe it has really become a cult classic among certain age groups br br the producer of this movie is a personal friend of mine he is my father in law he lives in manhattan's west side and has a bungalow in southampton long island his son in law live next door to his bungalow br br presently he does not do any producing but in a business with hbo movies br br as a person mr gil is a real gentleman and i wish he would have continued in the production business of move making
<START> this game is very good for the n64 you can skate as tony hawk bob steve kareem campell eric andrew reynolds steamer jamie thomas rodney mullen chad muska and maybe some more skaters the game doesn't have mike v or bam dang well anyway the gameplay is awesome the level school ii is a great level with so much to skate in career mode you collect skate get money get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes there's create a skater which is pretty cool i created a skater named butt mulligan a black guy with an afro and a girl board there's park editor some cool premade parks free skate and there's single session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score you can watch replays which is always cool each skater has 2 styles a and b the graphics aren't that good well they're good for an n64 game i wish i had a controller pack so i could save my data overall this game is awesome i give it an 8 10 for n64 but with the version it's just as fun as the n64 version but kinda hard to control i give it a 7 10 for so go out to a place that still sells n64 games and pick up a copy there's also versions for ps1
<START> as you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it at his church br br anyway movie had a good b movie sci fi beginning everything was there to make a good entertaining easy to watch movie then everything felt in this religious jesus will save everyone brainwashing mode br br story start with 2 main characters 2 reporters but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this con descendant attitude br br in a few words this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minutes br br waste of time waste of money avoid it
<START> this was painful recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper this british belgian co production from 1977 could've fooled me it looks ten years older than that at least is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the half hour mark consider yourself a trouper the combining of animation and live action is ropey at best and downright dreadful at worst which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasn't really there harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless i've seen with the obligatory moments especially where the animation of the brainiac type character is involved that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties onward instantly dated the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored as for adults stick to jonathan swift's original novel
<START> in 1961 this series was shown on local tv here in southern california i and many others have been petering bbc for tape or dvd ever since now all of a sudden here it is on amazon i pre ordered in january and now here on march 30 it arrived it was a long wait 48 years was it worth it so far i have just watched richard ii i've only had the dvd since 2 o'clock and i can truly say yea totally worth the wait the acting direction and production are superb and even better than i remember the production is in b w but somehow it fits the video is clear and very good the sound is flawless further proof of how timeless shakespeare truly is br br i gave this 10 stars even though i have only seen 1 of the 8 plays i am sure that when i have seen them all i will change my rating to at least a 12 br br it's currently in stock at amazon us region 1 at a reasonable price br br i'd better stop now so i can get back to watching next up is henry the iv part 1 of which is my all time favorite shakespeare play
<START> this movie lacked credibility for two reasons one no mayor of a major city and new york is certainly as major as it gets would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security all of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly jewish or defenseless at 62 years of age i have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did even escape from new york which was fictional up front i e they told you that this was science fiction didn't resort to such deep seated violence in this movie most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them also in this movie and i have not seen the prior two is more lawless than the escape movie secondly gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be on the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he's killed yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers the next gang over is welcomed with open arms outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped we are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang the other gangs want to be all into it why did the outside gangs come to help i believe that more than one gang from outside came to help what did they come for another question why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack bronson's character this was not a great movie and i could go on but i won't
<START> oh if any day u wanna see a supernatural thriller turning out to be a comedy watch this movie br br this film was a shocker as it had so many actors in it but what they do and how they fit in br br the handling of the college scenes is like a school play where each person comes talk and then the next person comes infront br br okay reasons to laugh at the film 1 akshay suneil aditya kapoor arshad as college students 2 akshay carries a gun in college 3 some pathetic stunts and sfx br br there are several more flaws like why doesn't the snake save his lover from being raped and comes in so late also why he doesn't kill all of them together there only br br but afterall they have to make a 2 hrs film so hence you have a movie br br the movie is painful to watch the film was directed by rajkumar who was an expert making such films in the past and had a successful record of films like jaani dushman 1979 and rajkumar wants to help his son's non existent career right from 1992 ke dushman 1993 and 1996 all flops he tried hard to promote his son and he also casts big stars so that his son gets noticed sadly nothing could help his son's career br br the film has several comical scenes like the death scenes how the actors after being bashed by the snake are so fit to fight him again and the climax br br direction by rajkumar is bad music is bad br br that brings us to the cast akshay kumar ordinary stuff he has nothing much to do rather then stunts suneil shetty awful the worst debutante award goes to him he gives cartoon acting a new meaning terrible arshad nothing to do kapoor bad aditya irritates sunny deol is comical in the scene when he comes to save lol ordinary akshay's pair kiran kumar raza are as usual raj hilarious for wrong reasons the girls are awful which brings us to this guy has a huge physique he is even more stronger and taller then akshay kumar sadly he comes across as poor man's akshay his voice is awful his expressions are painful the only thing he has to do in the movie is wear glasses and make an evil face bedi is awful
<START> i first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax as we all know betamax went the way of the 8 tape sigh it really had nice picture quality too anyways i'm glad i found this movie again i've been searching for it for more than 10 years this movie falls into the category of movies like airplane continuous jokes oneliners funny actions mark blankfield is absolutely hilarious his transformation from the shy dr daniel jekyll into the sex crazed mr hyde is unforgettable complete with and the part i loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to madam woo woo's totally psychedelic experience without the drugs if you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it when i first seen it i had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing this is a movie i could watch over and over again i highly recommend it
<START> this is the type of late night cable flick usually associated with andrew stevens or shannon tweed though unlike most of tweed and stevens' t a fueled vehicles this is lethally dull br br let's cut to the chase the real reason for watching this non thriller is to see shannon breasts anyone who states otherwise is a liar however most of her steamy sex scenes appear to be all smoke and mirrors br br notice that all the shots where her head and chest show at the same time are quick peek a boo flashes the frames where the camera lingers on her nude body there's little or no face attached or she's behind a dripping wet shower door br br all you boob watchers out there know what that means body double br br i must admit though that the finale where is bound blindfolded and menaced with a knife provided a certain fetishistic thrill br br if you find a vhs copy anywhere buy it as all involved are probably too embarrassed to ever let this come out on dvd
<START> the ghost 1996 the director made this too sappy a production maybe it's the generation but i really liked the charles laughton version there is a time and place for emoting and this production does not translate very well patrick stewart reciting shakespeare was very good but still inappropriate would neither recommend nor watch again the close ups and padded text and sub plots were lost on me adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work the screenplay writer should find another profession in which to his talent maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue check out the really good version and pass on this one
<START> i think this movie had really bad production value the lack of acting makes me think they should mark it as an early docudrama it may have had no money available for its making i feel bad that it was a ruff ride into the major league for jackie robinson br br i believe he was much better than many of the white players of his day he had to be really great to break the color barrier of the time no getting around that this was a really bad movie br br wish there was more info about its makers they may have been limited by the quality of actors that were willing to take on the project maybe no money to get good people
<START> almost four years after the iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever that's right so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the american way are now chasing their tails isn't that true you bet it is this movie said so from the beginning it is kind of freaky how much the film or should i say filmmaker knew what was coming it is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future there was a point when i felt the hairs standing up on the back of my neck as gw announced that 'major combat operations are over on top of a visual of a broken down rv being away with the american flag waving in the rear view mirror you have to see it to understand what i mean but even if you are apolitical or even if you are pro war this movie will have some kind of impact on you because it is so embedded in history
