<START> i bought this because it was 1 99 and harry carey was in it and a friend of mine was in it and for 1 99 how bad could it be then i read some comments here on the film and began to get excited maybe this really was a lost gem one of those terrific little b movies everyone had forgotten about but which deserved to be resurrected wrong i'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise it got from some quarters here but i found it one of the most tedious and blatantly bathos filled movies i've ever seen and i'm not talking about richard carlson's hokey texas accent straight from the georgia part of texas i guess it's just dumb no one in the film behaves like a real human being no one and no one does anything believable or interesting it's not even a clichÃ© fest it's just 80 something minutes of frames going by it even managed to make harry carey maria and c aubrey smith boring now that's unbelievable
<START> more suspenseful more subtle much much more disturbing
<START> definitely not a film to revolutionize the industry or introduce any new techniques of film making this is a very handsome and solid production it's miraculous that we can today enjoy it in superb quality on dvd probably most of the viewers about a 100 years ago saw a black and white copy as the tinted de edition was available only at the very best theaters even if you are not fascinated by this film or the subject of it you can't but marvel at the copy released by image entertainment together with another gem from the manger to the cross 1912 it's virtually impossible to see a film that is over a century old but shows so little damage the process of colouring was a very effective one and compared to the occasionally blurry and smeared images of hand coloured film the colours are crisp and well defined filmed within the limitations of the film making as known back in 1902 when the filming commenced the static nature of the scenes can today be considered almost intentional meditative and solemn the tableaux keep moving at a steady paste so the film never gets tedious you might not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography but it sure is handsome as a work of academic picturesque art if you are a religious person the fact that you are watching anonymous long since departed people playing long since departed characters adds to the mystery significantly a proper viewing for christmas or lent br br p s i've ticked the contains spoilers box just for fun as you can see i haven't revealed the ending
<START> spoiler alert although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain br br 'mulholland drive' is by far the most successful expression of david lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his 'twin tv series as lynch enthusiasts know his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir horror movies surrealism and Â with a healthy dose of postmodern self consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure all these elements are richly at work in 'mulholland drive ' making for a riveting hair raising and highly satisfying film experience Â especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical mystery unraveling whole br br the film features wonderful performances by naomi watts and laura in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a hollywood setting that is itself an blend of contemporary reality retro '50s nostalgia and satirical self aggrandizement their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the film's opening scene in which character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous not to mention horrific automobile accident staggering down the hillside from mulholland drive to sunset boulevard the two most archetypal of hollywood she finds her way to the very apartment that betty naomi watts is about to from her 'aunt ruth ' a purportedly successful actress who is off to canada to begin a new movie as we later learn betty had herself arrived from deep river ontario shortly after winning a jitterbug contest br br a highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre credit prologue sequences that frame betty's descent from the clichÃ©d would be bright eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit part actress unable to remember her own name the character adopts the name from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'gilda' that adorns aunt ruth's apartment actually it turns out aunt ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings anyway betty determines to help rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in rita's purse the two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to rita's true identity they also by the way become lovers at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that i cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of lesbian lover affairs if a lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream' br br at the local restaurant a recurring location fraught with dream like significance behind its grubby realistic facade rita's attention is caught by a name tag reading ' this leads her to a recollection of someone named selwyn ' whose apartment the two women soon visit and at betty's insistence break into i won't reveal what they find within but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage lynchian creepiness subsequently rita wakes in night sweats speaking spanish and hurrying betty to an all night magic show theater called ' where the arts of illusion and lip instrumental syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the blue haired lady as she is noted in the end credits reigns as the presiding muse framed by the blue lit red theatre the blue haired lady occupies the last shot in the film perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination Â rather like steven's man with the blue guitar as filtered through bad drug surrealism br br during the sequence and as del rio cameo lip her own powerful spanish rendition of roy a shattering epiphany occurs when betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in rita's purse even if we do not delve too deeply into the freudian sexual symbolism of purses the moment is a singularly hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings not the least of these reversals is the discovery that betty is the sought for diane selwyn and the spurned lover of camilla rhodes i e rita camilla in turn is a latin femme fatale movie star to whom diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and more significantly to whom she is emotionally subjugated br br after these and other discoveries in the last third of the film the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in ' while bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much if not all of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of diane herself other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'twin peaks ' including michael j anderson reprising his unearthly powers and a bob variant who hangs out behind and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id like associations br br however one fits the pieces together though the whole of 'mulholland drive' is much greater Â and more mysterious Â than the sum of its parts lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive provocative and disturbing mind trip what's more the film's cinematography is stunning the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics the acting superb and the directing editing masterful this may well have been the unacknowledged best picture of 2001 among major american releases
<START> cedric movie is easy breezy charm wrapped in nostalgia for our younger years and attractive youths at its core it's the feature length presentation of the long running mtv reality soap opera known as the real world in which as its motto goes this is the 'true story' of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped so watch what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real this is exactly what happens minus the cameras planted at every minuscule corner of the house in barcelona spain where xavier comes to stay having to learn spanish to fill into his job's requirements an outsider in many ways he slowly forms a camaraderie with his house mates who come from all corners of europe except america this is a movie in which the only american shown is an unlikable character with whom wendy the adorable kelly reilly is having an affair with only for sex she confesses since she has her own boyfriend who makes a late but dazed appearance throughout his stay there he tries to maintain a long distance relationship with his girlfriend played by audrey tautou while he begins a tentative flirtation with the wife of the owner of the spanish house where he is staying at and gets some advice from a lesbian house mate cecile de france as to how to seduce a woman a sweet little feature that presents a moment in time that twenty somethings will never see again is forgettable fun containing within itself the threshold into the real world experienced through eyes
<START> where do i begin with the killing mind before i mention the good bit this movie is about a young psychological profiling fbi woman or something that for some reason goes to work for the lapd for a wee while there are some recognisable faces like the i love you man bloke from wayne's world playing a cop nice beard age too and two guys who always seem to play cops playing you guessed it cops one of them was one of the cops in gross point blank following john cusack about the place and the other is the fbi guy with specs in final destination who is also in the fugitive as another cop i know the fbi us marshalls cia etc aren't cops but they're all the same they enforce the law to a certain degree that makes them cops in my book feel free to disagree with the definition of a cop all you want they're still seen as the ones who are trying to bring the bad guys down any i digress the woman is working alongside these cops who just seem to sit around in a library in the basement or something and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that hasn't been looked at for she saw the dead body as a kid so naturally decided that she can reopen the case cos she was personally attached to it i also like how the person profiling other people's psychological state witnessed a murder scene as a child surely that's the kind of thing that can screw with someone's head she starts asking questions off some journalist who covered the story when it was open even though he appears to be the same age as the woman so he presumably was either writing for a newspaper when he was 10 or he wrote a few school reports on it and she decided he'd be the best person to ask about it br br we then see that as well as reopening homicide cases from 25 years earlier she tries her hand at petty theft as some really inconspicuous bloke through a busy street wearing a balaclava way to blend moron anyway she and the cops she's with eating ice creams in the park give chase after him and whilst crossing a bridge with a woman and child standing on it the thief grabs the baby from the mother's arms and throws the baby in the river this if you haven't already guessed is the best bit of the movie i'm not sadistic and don't have a hatred for babies or anything but the scene just looks so stupid i promise you will wet your pants laughing at it if you should watch this movie it gets better when the cop from final destination the fugitive jumps in to rescue the baby then declares to his friend it's a baby how did he not know that before he jumped in is beyond me br br anyway she chases after the thief but loses him later on she remembers that a random dog didn't bark at the thief so assumed it must be his and decided to track down the thief through the dog the dog had no markings or anything on it so how she knew where to find the dog and thus find the thief is another question i won't go into it was shortly after this that i stopped watching the story was moving really slowly and after i had stopped laughing at the baby throwing bit i had kind of lost interest and missed what was being said br br saying that i'll go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist bloke because he seemed a bit shifty and she was spending a lot of time with him and anyone who watches columbo knows that the person outside the police force who spends most time with the investigating officer is your bad guy plus other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious so i'm sure it was him br br so all in all a pants film but worth watching just for that one glorious scene
<START> this all looked quite promising an up and coming presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the white house it stars the excellent donald sutherland among several capable actors yet very few people have a good word to say about it br br the whole thing really needed some depth you can pick up the idea that the president is being too left wing with his ideas and some within the government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out conrad appears to simply want the country to be governed his way rather than the way of the elected leader br br however the action scenes had a few logic holes the sewers and elevators already mentioned and the rather haphazard assassination method and linda hamilton's character is completely uninspired her 'the president's my father' was ludicrous that would make the president about 10 when that happened worse still was her predictable final scene with bishop br br they could have made a challenging inventive political thriller but either bottled it or failed they could've gone to town on special effects but the good ones were wasted they could have achieved so much more in general this was barely worth the Â£1 it cost me
<START> last week on friday i went to see snakes on a plane with my friends it was amazing compared to this horrible film however many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious basically some woman has a mayan curse where she pukes up harmless harmless garter snakes that instead of attacking crawl inside of they're victims the girl with the bag of coke is pretty hot on the title screen it says 100 passengers 3 000 vipers scary i know there weren't even 100 passengers on the train only a couple of stoners and some other washed out losers it's worth the five bucks to see the woman turn into a huge cg snake and devour the whole train then get sucked into a huge vortex though it's just sad that someone would go to such lengths to make a crap film only to make a few bucks because of the snakes on a plane craze
<START> pat conroy's autobiographical book the water is wide proves to be something of a southern up the down staircase yet despite the teacher going against the odds formula really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash these students uneducated black kids on an island off south carolina are actually shown learning and their collective wide eyed innocence is remarkably sweet the one actual actress in the bunch tina andrews an amazing performer plays the tough nut has to crack and once she falls under his charms it all seems a breeze but the story is not ready made for a happy ending and i wasn't prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale it's beautifully done the script veers off course every now and then but director martin ritt is very smart to always fall back on jon voight's solid presence scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van venting his frustrations over a loudspeaker don't add up to much but the whole film is filled with episodes which spark emotion and the actual ending is their payoff 1 2 out of
<START> ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid there's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself in this movie hillary swank is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her br br not to say this movie is not without it's problems unlike the first one mr miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life and doesn't really explain why they do what they do in the plot line the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly hateable bad guys i also have a suspicion about martial arts movies that end on prom night br br so maybe this isn't a perfect movie so maybe this wouldn't be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night however in more ways than one it's a guilty pleasure hillary swank is just so loveable and the story even though unoriginal works in a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence this is a breath of fresh air unlike all those steven seagal and jean claude van damme this is a movie about the spirit and the heart there are some people that need movies like this and we'll take whatever we can get my rating 8 10
<START> in the line of fire in my opinion is an excellent suspenseful and edge of your seat action drama thriller i thought that agent clint eastwood and agent raines rene russo looked good in the attire they wore at the presidential dinner as for leary john malkovich he was a sick man who loved to toy with frank by phone he looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film though one thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between agent and agent raines before i wrap this up i'd like to say that the entire cast and crew did an outstanding job i loved the setting and i couldn't get enough of it now in conclusion to all you clint eastwood fans who haven't seen this excellent suspenseful and edge of your seat action drama thriller i highly recommend it
<START> i've always liked sean connery but as james bond i've always favored roger moore still it was connery who set the bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than james bond the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of spectre br br and what designs they are in never say never again spectre with the help of a foolish young air force officer who happens to be kim bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now spectre headed by played here by max von sydow is threatening blackmail of the world br br von sydow's operations guy is klaus maria brandauer who is also courting bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side and he's got a female assassin working for him in barbara carrera who makes angelina jolie as nora croft look like mrs butterworth br br but before sean connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'm' running things at british intelligence edward fox thinks connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the british too much money with his violent ways i really did enjoy fox's performance he's like the great grandson of colonel blimp br br i also enjoyed carrera she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods when she's scuba diving with connery in the bahamas note how she puts mr shark on case br br will connery do james bond again he was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point roger moore's father but i think connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair
<START> this film gives a look at the suffering a family experiences at the death of a child and the healing that can finally come to them br br the family learns of the death of their son on christmas eve 1991 ruining the christmas season for them they do not celebrate it again for many years there is an interesting comment by the daughter that will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation br br the matthew character makes a reference to jesus but i suspect that other comments he makes come from non christian sources i wonder if any other viewers would recognize those comments if so it would be an interesting addition to the data on this movie
<START> i don't know why imdb lists all the ghoulies films as theatrical releases they were all straight to video films same with the puppet master series why hasn't anyone noticed this yet right somehow you've stumbled across ghoulies iv probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from 1993 you looked in the discount section and found this look at the back and front covers what do you expect the shawshank redemption there is no need to review this film so critically it is the fourth ghoulies film i bought it on dvd for 50 because it was 50 i knew it wasn't kubrick material and i was right an dvd with no extras not even a trailer boasts an for film br br it actually contains the star of the first ghoulies film peter who really didn't get many 'big' roles apart from those two films and i don't see why he's not too bad an actor and is pretty fun but i guess if you're gonna take a lead role in the ghoulies films scorsese and tarantino will lose interest also present is his idiot sidekick bobby di who despite having a very small resemblance to al pacino very small retains none of his acting ability a complete idiot who's just awkward to watch then there's stacie randall obviously a porn star i don't need to look that up she does look quite sexy though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility which is no easy task for such a film br br then there is the ghoulies themselves who also manage to let us down ghoulies iii made them start talking mistake no 1 but ghoulies iv takes it a step further instead of being puppets this time the ghoulies are in fact kids in costumes the filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers also there's only two of them and they're not the main highlight of the film as they don't appear in a lot of it however at times they are mildly amusing and they're not evil this time either br br this really is hilariously bad stuff it's amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it i dunno why some of the black humour is actually funny though the script is mostly effortless imagine satan's only threat to you being that he will kill you slowly painfully br br but at least full moon had no involvement this time did they yeah a very bad and cheaply made film with 0 production value but not so bad as to be in the ranks of puppet master 1 2 lawnmower man 2 surviving christmas or even ghoulies iii
<START> i first saw this film in the early 80's on cable it was unique as a statement about the sixties culture war music race and a bunch of things i'm certain i missed however about a year ago it came back into my life as i started enjoying it with my son he's a little young 9 for a lot of the themes in it but he understands dancing hippies are fun to watch and he gets the idea that end is ironic while i can't think of other films in this genre it does have a stand alone genius i love it also does a unique justice to central park most musicals are lost on me one way or another tommy was over the top and heavy handed in direction oliver seemed like crowd control on the silver screen the wall was so much abstract self important and indulgent dribble but listening to failure of the flesh from hair sounds right for our times today as it did in the eighties as it must have in the sixties truly timeless
