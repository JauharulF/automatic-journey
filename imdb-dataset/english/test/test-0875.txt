<START> blade is a fantastic action thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and wesley snipes delivers what i would say to be his best performance yet br br this film has everything that you would ask for in an action thriller it has plenty of blood guts and gore a twisted disturbed bad buy moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists br br their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects wesley snipes fighting movement is fantastic br br this film is in my opinion a must see wesley snipes cool solid appearance makes this film and i can't wait for the sequel 'blade 2' being released next year br br my imdb rating 9 out of 10
<START> wow this is the movie that should be shown on tv at two in the morning on cinemax for all those insomniacs lord knows they'd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie terrible acting the killer is quite far from scary i've seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier lot's of unnecessary in this film pseudo porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million a soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film i could see a group of teenagers with their parents camcorders doing better work than this i don't think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone
<START> simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah am also giving these 4 stars just because of her on the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen was horrible the script was uninspired this was a movie that kept contradicting itself the film was sloppy and unoriginal its not like i was expecting a good film just something to give me a jump or two this did not even do that br br he worst thing is that the more i think about the overall plot the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding a real shame really as i'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere br br i'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4 10 but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent this film really should have delivered far more br br this movie is just crap i cant put it differently since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap br br the story dialogue acting special effects make up pretty much everything sucks i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing i can't believe how somebody produced this thing br br it's not even about vampires it's more about a dream reality experience the development of the movie is incoherent the motivation of the characters is doesn't exist everything seems like a big joke maybe that's what they tried to do but i sincerely doubt it i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired it's definitely one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life and i've seen many bad movies but nothing compared to this please make yourselves a favor and do not watch this br br p s it's also full of clichÃ©s p s 2 bad script bad directing bad cinematography p s 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone
<START> this is one of those made for tv b movies that is so awful it kind of br br bad acting predictable script and cheesy special effects that were pretty much some of the cheapest tat seen make you have to keep watching to see if it gets any better br br it doesn't
<START> inside i'm dancing rory o'shea was here is the story of two handicapped young men rory o'shea who is almost completely and confined to wheelchair and michael connelly who is by ms and also confined to a wheelchair br br set in ireland the film opens with rory arriving at a assisted living center he eventually befriends michael but only after a few tense scenes where rory rebels against the staff and other patients in the usual movie way playing loud metal music using profanity and general obnoxiousness his budding friendship with michael is cemented by the fact that rory seems to be the only one who understands michael or is at least willing to try br br eventually through some trial and tribulation the pair petition and are granted the right to live own their own in specially adapted apartment the apartment is paid for by michael's father who had essentially abandoned him do to his disability the two also hire an attractive assistant named siobhan played by romola garai to help them with their day to day living this is essentially where the crux of the film develops as both develop feelings for her michael is struck particularly hard unfortunately for both but michael especially siobhan does not feel the same and it results in her having to leave as michael temporarily regresses and wants to return to the asst living center rory convinces him to continue to live on his own the film ends on a sad note that many viewers may have seen coming but ultimately we are left feeling that michael has truly become independent and the future is his as rory pointed out to him towards the end of movie br br you know i can't say that i've seen a lot of handicapped films and i don't know if they could be considered a specific genre but there is a type of formula to them one person is unwilling to live beyond his illness until some liberating force compels him her to do so and inside i'm dancing is really know different what works however is it probably is more subtle about the peaks and valleys the two men go through then what you might expect there are no intentionally gratuitous moments and no stand up and cheer manipulations the sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny some viewers might recoil a bit that rory is the spiky haired punk type with the earing in his nose as the too perfect rebel clichÃ© but the actor james mcavoy somehow makes it real the same can be said for steven robertson who plays michael when michael's heart is broken it doesn't seem to be invoked by a poor script trying to get the audience worked up but rather a young man genuinely in pain over unrequited love the kind of pain many can relate to whatever their physical condition again these are the types of things that make the film work and make it poignant without being overbearing and enjoyable on many levels br br recommended
<START> i've only seen most of the series since i leave the tv on as background noise in my dorm br br i've been a fan of mencia but this show really doesn't do much for me occasionally he'll say or do something to pull a chuckle out but he has this aura of smugness that completely ruins it br br i've always thought he was funny because of his raging angry man routine that's not terribly prevalent in this tv series instead he's just smug i guess that just reflects how funny his comedy is stale and uninteresting when he isn't in the proper mode of delivery i've seen him get into it sometimes on his show but for the most part he just sits there smiling and looking smug and it doesn't suit him well br br just my opinion though
<START> this movie had horrible lighting and terrible camera movements this movie is a jumpy horror flick with no meaning at all the slashes are totally fake looking it looks like some 17 year old idiot wrote this movie and a 10 year old kid shot it with the worst acting you can ever find people are tired of knives at least move on to guns or fire it has almost exact lines from when a stranger calls with gruesome killings only crazy people would enjoy this movie it is obvious the writer doesn't have kids or even care for them i mean at show some mercy just to sum it up this movie is a b movie and it sucked just for your own sake don't even think about wasting your time watching this crappy movie
<START> this film stands as one of the most amazing examples of compelling and artful film making i've every seen herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of story as well as his endearing personal character by the end of the film i was left wishing that i'd had the opportunity to meet dieter before his passing br br on a technical note the cinematography is intimate and astoundingly beautiful the narrative is intricately woven with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for reliving and reenacting traumatic events few documentary directors have so strong an ability to so thoroughly invest the audience in the character this film is a must see
<START> i have seen this movie many times and i never get sick of it it is about a man coming out of the closet that he doesn't know he is in kevin kline's character is a teacher and when one of his former students announces kline's character is gay the people in his town start to speculate whether he is straight or gay kline's character starts to wonder if he is straight or gay too the acting is absolutely fabulous and hilarious by all the cast i found the movie very funny and heart warming i love this movie it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while watching it i recommend this movie to everyone you will have a great time watching it
<START> i watched 5 of this movie tonight and you may tell me that i need to see the whole movie to understand it but frankly i don't think so br br what the hell is the story in this movie i saw a lot of people running around in a factory shooting at everything around them br br where to start okay br br 1 they were shooting around the place as if it was the terminator or something they were trying to kill the entire place is made of metal but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces br br 2 no ricochet metal vs metal is bound to cause but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet br br 3 magic bullets in one scene a bad guy is standing right in front of a good guy when another good guy pops out behind the bad guy and pumps him full of metal you see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist but the good guy right in front of him doesn't get hurt at all 4 after having just splattered a human being all over the wall the two good guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft guns br br 5 sound at one point the good guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm the lady screams out alarm in sector blah blah and the bad guy boss says okay this is not a drill blah blah in a very very amateur kinda way ooh we're getting ambushed by terrorists this isn't a drill but i'm gonna sound like i don't give crap br br 6 focus first you see the bad guys load up on weapons for some reason the same guy gets the same uzi twice deja vu or loop of scenes you literally see every single bad guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way the weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad guy extra no xx locks and loads when they started opening fire you had to see the barrel flashes boooring 7 actors or dummies one of the presumed good guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they're smoke blind or something so they don't see it coming they cough and moan as if it was anthrax in the grenade then a semi boss bad guy arrives and he doesn't even cough when he enters the smoke he just pushes the other bad guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn't anthrax anyway br br 8 b flick i think yeah a guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently i'd like to see a guy fire a uzi with one hand and i'd like to see him go get his hand afterwards extra bloody gore mess in a b flick kinda way small pops and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead though the first bullet hit his heart the good guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy br br 9 one of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip how stupid can you be always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies 10 boring scenes like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building cut to the action if you're going for a b flick movie please br br my two cents on this movie
<START> i just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and i can't remember a movie where i laughed so hard literal out loud deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesn't matter that you know how it's going to end the actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable the actors were perfectly cast my children mentioned that amanda bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who aren't ruining their lives she is so refreshing my children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006 our money was well spent on this movie
<START> normally i do not review online but it's saturday and i'm trapped in my room on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci fi movies and xena warrior princess i can't get the damned the song out of my head it's been there for the past ten years or so just pops up randomly when someone me does something idiotic if you have any complaints about this movie and actually post them on the internet do you have any idea how much of an idiot you look like if you expect more out of bruce campbell than what he puts out in the most literal sense than why in g d's holy name do you watch his movies no one watches a bruce campbell movie when they want to see something genius and intelligible we watch them so we feel better about ourselves like those people who watch jerry springer and eat chunky monkey and to be easily entertained by mindless psycho babble i personally love bruce campbell movies i'm not a complete idiot in fact i see myself as an intellectual and a scholar haha shut up ally his movies reflect insane random quirky ridiculous ideals which anyone with a brain screaming or no can enjoy that and he was kind of sexy on xena warrior princess even with the facial hair i rate this movie an excellent 10 just because i can if you can't take simplistic plot schemes if any hot babes in sci fi splendor leather spandex and familiar if not exhausted views of insanity then fer out loud don't watch the movie or any that so much as mention the name bruce campbell oh yeah ted raimi was awesome in this movie way to go ted you did the best with what you had
<START> it seems a lot of europeans and americans see indian movies for the wrong reason i see some people are complaining that this movie did not have any dance sequence a class apart from their hindi counterparts movies tend to be more realistic is one of the best young directors in india being widely known for his choice of subjects for the movies and the strength of his scripts is a perfect example a faithful adaptation of the nobel laureate novel dealing with the pursuit of sexual pleasure of a widow the director gives a new dimension to the much acclaimed and controversial work
<START> maybe it's just that it was made in 1997 or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with aids but really people the maniacal laughter mayhem during the withdrawal scene did you not see that coming i'm surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and addressing the camera the acting was fine sure but to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language things happen but that's it there's no glue or motive that can be detected on screen allowing the subject matter to use pre existing emotional connections to the plot without the script doing it like it's supposed to
<START> i live and work in lexington kentucky the town where zombie planet was filmed i'd heard about the film forever ago from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production then for several years i heard absolutely nothing imagine my surprise when i found it sitting all by itself at the local video store just itching for a rental so being the cinephile that i am i decided to give these local filmmakers a shot br br bad idea br br zombie planet is overlong boring poorly acted miserably shot and that's just the good stuff i tried my hardest to enjoy it which included removing my brain and setting it on the table so that it wouldn't get in the way of the horrible storyline alas nothing worked zombie planet is so bad it's pathetic and the very idea that they're planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have listened to none of the criticisms i'm sure they've heard move on you guys please in fact refrain from film making altogether or attend a few classes on pacing storytelling and well basic direction br br otherwise for the love of god hang it up
