<START> unlike some of the reviews written here i didn't hate this movie it is a movie that could have been much better than it was not oscar material true but much better than it was br br i thought the plot had a good hook and through line granted this movie was badly written and terribly directed and produced i mean how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have why were we there what exactly is the point of the opening sequence it seems like the producer s watched american beauty a few too many times and thought 'i'll use that in an action movie ' i thought the movie wasn't that badly acted wesley snipes did a credible job he just ran afoul of some bad direction and once this movie hit the production room things just got worse the main actress i think had the same problems some of the other acting was suspect yes but it was a low budget flick again i would say it is the director's job to pick that up and correct it br br as an overall recommendation i would agree with the first review i read that this movie is not worth seeing or maybe it is worth seeing if you are a film student and want to see what not to do br br 3 10 and that's giving it praise
<START> so much for judge and jury which lives up to its nonsense title what good is there the lighting is terribly foggy another horror movie you ask well that's perfectly explainable david keith actually does pretty good at disguising clowns chefs and other shenanigans while being the killer who escaped death row but overall despite some new twists it's reasonably stupid has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently and this one only means so much we the jury find this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing it's a total waste of our time
<START> i was very disappointed by this movie ms english who says that she is a fan of the original movie seemed to have taken a great piece of artistic work and transformed it into a flat lined ho hum you've come a long way baby production i tried to like meg ryan's mary haines but she was just boring she didn't seem to feel anything about her husband's affair there was no emotional struggle no deep hurt in the original 1939 movie norma shearer's mary haines felt betrayed shocked vulnerable confused and angry the 2008 production was more about some fake sisterhood theme actually my wife's words and didn't make you shed a tear or even chuckle the only performances that were note worthy we're of debra messing and bette midler i wanted more of bette there was really no protagonist in this movie the sylvia fowler character had too many sub themes to it and crystal allen had no fire the remake of the department store encounter with annette benning and miss mendez was luke warm also the pacing was slow as well obviously the 1939 version needed to be updated but this one wasn't it the reason that the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with man problems a subject by the way which isn't out dated the magic of the original movie was that the movie was about both sexes while you never saw the men
<START> little dieter needs to fly was my first film during the 1999 edition of the gÃ¶teborg filmfestival as i was extremely tired that evening i was hesitant to see it but the raving overall score of 9 here at imdb made me go there br br it was 80 minutes of pure life force experiencing dieter life through his own telling was enchanting br br see it and if possible see it at a cinema
<START> this movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the north americian party or some similar group the strong man places himself above the law but not outside the law and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash the only thing that made me think it wasn't made by the kkk was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group and you'll see what i mean br br it's a tragedy that jimmy page actually made music for this movie
<START> relentless like one of those loud action movies the entire cast seems to be on speed i didn't quite get the director's intentions if any i wonder if she's ever seen a stanley donen vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical structure please this is one hell of a mess and i loved abba the costumes the unflattering photography unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself no chemistry with her friends christine baranski and julie walters think of streep with lily in the altman film and you'll understand what i was hoping for i was embarrassed in particular by pierce and colin firth the audience however seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me
<START> there is part of one sequence where some water rushes into the sunken plane everything else that happens in this movie is stock footage for airport 77 you can even make out jack lemmon and christopher lee in some of the shots a total rip off well almost by definition there may be more stock footage in this film than in plan 9 from outer space br br all the new material actors sitting around in an airplane set talking is bland and terrible on every level dennis weaver is totally wasted in a career low movie though that's true for everyone other than this films director fred olen ray who uses one of this many necessary fake names in order to keep working br br there is a level of scant professionalism that makes this film such a waste of time it would actually be better if shot by someone with no technical knowledge at all because ray has just enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst old school tv fashion that this film like most of his films is totally devoid of life the worst kind of hack work the worst kind of film boring br br this type of film is a waste of money an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts hoping to get whatever scant pay check they can and that no one will see or know they appeared participated in this rip off there are so many people who want to make movies it's disgusting to see ray burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill time br br his commentary track is interesting in that he has to start it by explaining that he is really fred ray as he isn't credited on the film itself that tricked me into seeing it don't let it trick you
<START> this is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s otto preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them frank sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by elmer bernstein is dynamite from the opening titles by saul bass to the hysteria of drug addict frank going cold turkey this is a riveting movie with kim novak giving a very good performance eleanor parker giving a very bad performance as well as darren mcgavin as the reptilian pusher and arnold as frank's grifter pal beware of bad prints this movie is in the public domain so some copies are pretty rough
<START> actually i have more a question than a comment i loved z boys and the lords of dogtown saw lords first then the doc and while i loved the story i am curious as to why in the movie sid was an important character but in the documentary he wasn't part of the team and only merely mentioned as just some kid they knew does anyone know the story on that the story of these boys was amazing i never experienced the skateboarding craze where i grew up but my kids have enjoyed it what i have seen in local skate parks is what these boys had invented i never knew that when the film showed the competition and z boys did their thing they put to shame the others in competition
<START> from the opening sequence filled with black and white shots reminiscent of gordan parks photos this film draws the viewer into a feeling of artistic renaissance the backdrop of a poetry cafe aptly named the sanctuary provides just that the jazz that permeates the film and the cinematography will seduce you br br this story of love actually allows love to grow to evolve and ultimately mature a rarity in hollywood everyone can identify with some stage of their journey towards each other this tale of two artist that just can't quite get it together sparked a debate amongst its viewers should she have gone away should he have stopped her who knows br br starring larenz tate darius and long nina moseley with a scene stealing performance by isiah washington and lisa nicole carson josie nichols as the ultimate best friend this film is a romantic jewel br br see this one with someone you love wink
<START> is some kind of saint he wants to live in life exactly how christ taught man to do but it's too late now the catholic church is between the hands of a wealthy bourgeoisie the bishops live in luxury and don't give a damn about the poor and the sick that's why our hero can't follow the way his hierarchy asks him to follow so he himself of everything and on his way to purity he's joined by some kind of mary and a woman who's attracted by him sexually the scene between this girl and her fiancÃ© is telling in spain it was the late fifties they thought was a christian movie knowing luis bunuel it was downright incongruous all his work is to a fault comparing and his holy women to jesus is a nonsense on way only and couch grass grow his attempt at helping working men on the road is a failure he's chased out as a strike breaker all his words amount to nothing at the end of the journey he's arrested and offered a pineapple by a woman sexual symbol thanks to bunuel was allowed to return to spain where the censors had not got a clue and to direct
<START> despite the all star cast this attempt at epic fails it comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too too clever social commentary br br it's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says isn't that clever am i not smart isn't that biting social commentary and sadly the answer is always ummmm no wearying self absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera in the worst sense of the term than a movie and an obvious attempt at television immortality thankfully it died young empire falls falls flat
<START> this is a great western story with outstanding veteran actors who made this film great entertainment to view and enjoy glenn ford john parrish midway '76 tries to play low key after having experienced battles in the war and plays the peace maker role for the time being john parrish decides the town is entirely too rough and tough and goes to visit barbara stanwyck martha crime of passion 57 who is the wife of edward g robinson lee the red house '47 lee offers john parrish fifteen thousand dollars for his ranch and john turns down the offer lee decides to have his son brian keith cole the wind the lion '75 change his mind in more ways than one there are romantic scenes between may wynn caroline vail the caine mutiny '54 and john parrish and some hot encounters with dianne foster judith three hours to kill '54 who hates her father lee if you like edward g robinson and glenn ford films this is a film you will want to view and enjoy from beginning to end
<START> this is another of those films i can remember from when i was a kid and i recently managed to acquire it off ebay 20 years on it's nowhere near as good as i remember it being br br the story is kick started by a event' there's another extra film crew member in the credits for story development' which makes collective ants become super intelligent ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together the thing i wanted to know throughout was to do what exactly you never find out what they want nigel davenport and his sidekick travel out to the desert where bizarre ant activity has been noted and begin to study the ants from an impregnable shaped laboratory probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visit the giant square in the crops like a square version of a crop circle a result of the ants chomping away br br this film was not very scary quite simply because you don't know whether to fear the ants or like them all you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can get on with their hijinks but you don't find out whether they are really baddies it ain't a sci fi because the event' explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account it is more of a chiller tbh the flares daft hairstyles tight shirts with big collars and nigel unnaturally big facial hair do freaked me out more than the ants did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits yup that right six and you won't see any other human beings in this film at all not even in the distance this is a plainly obviously low budget film which is a bit watchable because you probably won't have seen one like it i can't think of any anyway the filming of the ants is pretty good they must have done months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to stick in the film you may well say to yourself 'how the hell do they get the ants to do that ' over and over but it is all quite simple you will also notice that the film makers sacrificed millions of innocent ants to make the film too so animal rights peeps stay away good for novelty value but you may not watch it more than once
<START> christine sandy and mary tyler moore holly davis worked well with material ted danson did his best with a thankless role of chip davis the premise of this that the two ladies' friendship one a seemingly happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her biological clock ticking i found the relationship that ted character had with the single woman played by christine lahti's rather sordid he behaved in a way yet he left two widows pining over him bawling i found it revolting when when sandy told him she wanted to break it off after meeting his wife he calls her saying he misses her did he call his wife there was no sign of that he behaved like a heel it perhaps would have made a more interesting film had he not been killed off perhaps both ladies would have wised up and dumped him i liked the friendship between the two ladies but it was spoiled by what they had in common the cad of a husband
