<START> well i will come clean and admit that i was forced as part of my history degree to watch this film and then write a short film review as part of my grade br br yet even if i had watched the film alone at my own discretion i found it extremely boring and absurd the style is dated beyond its years and the acting is farcical rather than use dialogue they instead exchange eye popping glances at each other or sometimes into thin air for me such over the top acting does not convey any greater emotion and after seeing an extreme close up face for the hundredth time i was praying for the film to end br br the most disappointing though is how wrong character is this man was nasty his bodyguard's murderous thugs and his character cowardly for me the film was nothing but a piece of stalin propaganda inaccurate and dull
<START> tv director uses astral projection to kill people taking the form of the blue man br br dull uninvolving horror film that kind of just sits there before your eyes and makes you wonder why you are watching it i sat through the film to the end and i really can't give you more than a cursory account of what the film was about because i kept finding my attention diverted by other things br br i can't really recommend this i think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that i paid a dollar for the dvd as a double feature and i feel kind of ripped off
<START> it's what you expect it induces laughter cringing and dry heaving not necessarily in that order it's over the top you will see things that you may never be able to erase from your mind's eye jackass number two is better than the first the actors definitely took more risks while filming this movie there are many stunts which could have killed the actors especially johnny knoxville the treatment of animals was suspect but other than that the movie achieved what is was made to achieve if you like the preview see the movie if you don't steer clear br br 8 out of 10
<START> a vg brit rom com one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy quirky and often surprising this is not the best of brady's films kiss kiss bang bang is by far the funniest though it does have a unique charm well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high you know from the start how it's going to end but when it comes it is honest and very open ended a realistic and credible ending the end seemed like a beginning enjoyable and left me wanting more
<START> this movie is funny if you're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me repeating every punchline laughing when there were no gags on screen and issuing a gravelly at every scene involving a computer or mobile device br br for everyone else it's a mean spirited bungled comedy the movie strictly follows the formula of the later scary movie films as well as epic movie and meet the spartans though without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating still the lampooning of intellectual and figures the world over makes it clear that the film knows its audience people who envy brainpower superhero movie is particularly and consistently nasty to stephen hawking introducing him as a sex starved druggie and using his disability as a vehicle for slapstick br br the plot is based on spider man with batman begins and x men thrown in just to deliver some physical comedy much of the movie is slapstick but not in any invigorating or interesting way the longest running gag is a fart joke and early on the scriptwriters seem to believe that having the main character get thrown in conspicuous piles of fake animal poo automatically enlivens an otherwise uninspired rehash of the spider bite scene from spider man perhaps the only redeeming feature of this feature is the energy in it notably absent in other recent parodies the filmmakers act as though they're doing something new and the audience can feel the influence in the way the actors bounce around the screen an extremely abbreviated length about an hour and fifteen minutes and the zest of the presentation makes superhero movie tolerable rather than horrifying
<START> my family and i enjoy this show and find it a fair thumb nail sketch of what the people went through br br my own father spent some time in before going onto the thailand burma railway in f force much as been said about the treatment the pow's received i will just say that my father was 6 foot 1 inch and lbs when singapore fell at the end of the war he was 5 foot 11 inches tall and 91 lbs br br no show could truly convey what the pow's went through but this comes closer than most br br as the ex pow's say if you didn't have mates you didn't survive this show succeeds in getting this message across
<START> my friend made me watch this awful film ugh it was so stupid br br its about some black guy who gets a plane company and turns it into a stupid pimp thing br br with snoop dog acting as pilot for god knows why this movie is trashing white people and having many racist stereotypical events making fun of br br white people and trying to make the movie seem like all black people are cool pimps and all white people a losers and black people get all the girls blah blah blah and so forth br br i despise my friend for making me watch this movie i kept saying god turn it off and he's like no i bet something funny is about to happen we did end up finally turning it off half way through thank god br br i recommend this movie to people with very very poor taste in humor
<START> this is one peace of art if you like comedy you should watch this here comes a funny moment from the movie spoiler br br nikolai and are walking together in paris for the first time they are visiting the local market and goes look nikolai how much food they have look one two three ten thirty fifty hundred kinds of meat but if ask for a tiny tiny peace just for the taste they won't give you french are very greedy then takes nikolai to a tv shop tell me who needs all these televisions look at this monster here for example points a finger at the monster tv and goes and this motherfu he is supposed to be digging a ditch but no he's on tv wait a minute that's me hahah br br wanna laugh watch the movie you won't regret
<START> overall it was a watchable movie i didn't pause it or stop it to come back to it a clear sign of a boring movie so it passed the first test best of all it got into the story fast no boring unneeded back story for the characters br br it will never go down as a great movie nor as a great b movie i would recommend this movie to slasher horror fans who don't mind straight to video releases br br unlike some movies of it's ilk there is no nudity only moderate language and rather subdued gore there is violence though the deaths were rather dry and unimaginative sadly the computer special effects were actually pretty good the way the 'creature' wielded his chains in some scenes reminded me of and the 'ghost comic books br br a little pet peeve it's set in but no one seems to talk with any accent i had to watch the credits to even realize it was filmed in br br like most low budget movies there are small goofs in the filming lack of time and money would be the main factors for the goofs for example in one scene it went from mid afternoon to pitch black in seconds during a short car ride the other instance was the stunt double for the 'creature' didn't have on the 'creature' makeup when falling out of the tow truck it also looks like he's wearing a shirt in the scene br br in summary i didn't hate this movie but i also didn't love it i probably will never rent it again but if a buddy owned it i may watch it again in a few years
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a while the acting was just soooo bad is usually a fairly good actor but in this film he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper especially his voice over was extremely wooden beau van was completely over the top as frat boy fraser although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue van is an adaptation of a book and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue it all sounded way to bookish br br some of the situations were very badly visualized example somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a canoe goes over in a rapid this bit is just too incredible to be true you see an obviously rather shallow bit of river with a lot of rocks right beneath the surface hence the rapid we hear some suspenseful music to warn us that there's danger ahead a canoe with to girls goes over in that rather shallow rapid our hero then dives several meters below the surface to rescue one of the girl girl swoons in his arms and utters the words 'you saved me ' vomit br br it actually was so bad that it became funny this is sad because it really wasn't intended at the intermission i overheard some guy behind me say 'o god there's another part ' my feelings exactly what scares me is that the end credits of van were in english does this mean that it will be released abroad just when the netherlands were starting to get a good reputation after films like antonia's line and character
<START> you would probably get something like this i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5 year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence of course there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things br br one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much i wish someone told the director that it's kind of ridiculous even in an unrealistic art movie to portray a slavic woman as a half articulate dishevelled creature connected to the forces of nature probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and milking cows on a three legged stool
<START> just after having moved into his new cottage in the english country hercule poirot gets an invitation to dinner from sir henry and lady the owners of a large mansion nearby but the next day one of the guests is found shot near the pool and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away br br this agatha christie mystery is somewhat thin though the killer's plan is still very clever it's the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level this episode mostly keeps the serious tone of five little pigs and sad but contains more dark humor than them the cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point edward fox as the butler and sarah miles as lady though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful megan dodds as the ahead of her time henrietta her one on one confrontations with suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film oh and since an english police inspector does get involved in the case i think they could have brought philip jackson back for this one
<START> this movie is stupid there's no getting around it but so is dumb and dumber mind you dumb and dumber is significantly more funny than this however i for one love seeing stupid movies tail sting and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is call me callous but see this movie and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it
<START> one of the message boards threads at imdb had two women talking about colin firth how they watched the movie only because of him obviously these were two young women but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally the brilliant and i mean brilliant performances by michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange were hardly noticed not only by audiences but by the academy and by most of the critics br br i think i know why first the plot or actually just the setup is a kind of bastardization of shakespeare's king lear with the dying crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit their names even begin with the same letters regan and rose ginny and caroline and i guess larry jason robards works for lear the apparent idea envisioned by jane smiley in her pulitzer prize winning novel was to tell a lear like story from the point of view of the daughters and to tell it a sort of late twentieth century realistic way not considered by the bard the problem is in smiley and story the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities his only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm however we can even discount that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it br br the second problem and this is one i cannot personally attest to not having read smiley's novel is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel still it is almost always the case that an excellent novel especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen the vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints don't allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist given five or six hours perhaps could have made a movie more in keeping with smiley's novel br br a third problem is one that is perhaps alone she began her directing career with the very well done aussie film proof 1991 starring russell crowe she follow it up with how to make an american quilt 1995 which celebrated women especially women of a certain age however it was a bit heavy handed and clearly and determinedly a chick flick in a sense a thousand acres takes off from there showing us not only the point of view of women but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some larry cook is clearly a bad bad daddy he beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them he ran the household with an iron fist jess colin firth's character seduces the inexperienced ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear and then he goes to rose who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership and hooks up with her while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident the rest of the men are one dimensional characters without nuance the way they often appear in romance novels i think most audiences were put off by the heavy handed incest adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story br br having said all this i think the critics and the public are wrong i think the direction was biased against men but in this story it needed to be i think did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty and the acting by pfeiffer and lange was nothing short of sensational they seemed to feed off of one another in a way that i found absolutely authentic and deeply moving in particular pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bent up anger and hatred the way allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to outstanding performance and the skill with which guided the change in character as she went from a as she called herself to someone with self awareness and some understandable bitterness was also excellent the fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else he needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back and robards in his intensity and madness was also very good br br i predict that this film which bombed in theaters will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on dvd my question is whatever happened to her talent is obvious but she has yet to director her fourth feature film when she does i hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well i think actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film but didn't pay enough attention to the others in addition to the unnuanced father jennifer jason leigh's caroline was unfinished leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did and the husbands needed to be something more than mannequins they needed to be engaged and involved
<START> rs 30 is all i paid as rent for the dvd of the movie and believe me it is not worth it br br bollywood directors think that showing fools is funny well it is not please grow up br br here goes a dialog from the movie tum ko to tumhe br br plot is useless criminals and police alike running after fools that is it bhagam bhag br br well it lived the title i had to run away from it i switched over to star movies and watched home alone 2 instead and had a good laugh
