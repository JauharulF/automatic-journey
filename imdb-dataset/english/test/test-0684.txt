<START> don't bother to check for logic there is none but on the other hand there are many really great movies that totally lack logic so why bother br br i both like and dislike this film i like it because the action sequences in the air are really great you get to see a lot of i also like the f 16 which is a very cool plane br br but there are just too many goofs to make me really enjoy it i guess it's not fair to wish for some sort of continuity as it is hard to make a really good fighter film but i also think there should be some sense of reason br br and i have a question do they fly from california to the middle east in f 16s without air refueling i'd like to see that happening
<START> there are a few scripts like this one floating around hollywood this one is not even close to the best just the first this is all production value no substance but the disney name probably will help it a good idea a wasted opportunity
<START> this puddle of derivative drivel stole from every soviet film of note and failed miserably i was left with an experience of everything that is wrong with organized religion in general and the russian orthodox church's particular shortcomings mind you this comment comes from a person of faith even the outstanding cinematography left me uninspired i spent its most beautiful moments very aware of the masterworks that it was poorly imitating i would not recommend seeing this movie unless you have a deep passion for the russian orthodox church its traditions miracles in the face of communism and saints of the seventies it is a meaningless film from and about a narrow perspective that did absolutely nothing for me
<START> i'm not sure i've ever seen a film as bad as this awful acting all over the place plot terrible special effects there are some 'so bad its good' moments in here but not really enough to maintain interest the woman who plays tracey looks hideous there are some fairly worrying scenes with a dwarf which leave you feeling ever so slightly violated on the plus side the operation scenes are fairly amusing for the special effects as is the car chase where one car is trying to force us off the road without actually making contact guess the budget didn't stretch to trashing cars oh and what looks like a postcard of the taj mahal is shown every time they cut to the fictional foreign country
<START> this movie is so stupid that i want my 2 99 back that i paid for first this movie starts off with a bunch of wooden actor geeks with fill in talent like they got picked off the street somewhere because the real actors either did not show up because of the laughable script or they just couldn't get anybody desperate enough to do this movie the music in this movie is enough to put you to sleep flute music made for dancing in the wilderness wouldn't even be good enough for this movie and the guy dressed up as satan looks like he's all dressed up in a k mart halloween special costume there are no dead scenes except a few lame scenes when i saw what the terrible killers looked like in those bath robes with nosferatu faces i just laughed this is what the whole town is supposed to be running away from once a year this movie is one of the worst demonic movies i have ever seen avoid this one
<START> i absolutely adored this movie for me the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like boston legal or ally mcbeal or even la law this is reality the law is not bs won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt like the chewbacca defense on south park this is a real travesty of justice the legal system gone horribly wrong and the work by good lawyers not the shyster stereotype who use all of their skills to right it it will do more for restoring your faith in humanity than any frank capra movie or to kill a mockingbird and most importantly i wept during the film during the featurette included at the end of the dvd it's amazing wonderful film wonderfully made thank god the filmmakers made it
<START> king of queens is comic genius kevin james whom plays ips doug is extremely funny leah who plays wife carrie is incredibly hot 19 on stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list and very funny the true magic of the show however is the scenes with jerry stiller they are the funniest in the show jerry a comic genius plays carrie's father arthur spooner whom lives in doug and carrie's always cold basement i must admit that i never watched this show until this year 2006 whenever i had flipped by it previously it never seemed funny but with the cancellation of friends still standing and yes dear i needed some new comedy actually giving the king of queens a chance i discovered that it was absolutely fantastic so funny in fact that i downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched each season in 8 hour blocks i strongly urge anyone whom has not seen this treasure to check it out you will not be disappointed
<START> there are many film now on dvd but producers had forgotten some of importance to many moviegoers the egyptian along with el cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen big budget epics had merit many people from my generation learn a lot about history of egypt medieval spain and even the incas the first time i heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with charlton heston called the treasure of the incas same happened to me with egypt or rome seen many bad epics of the era many production values excellent use of color the de color was more and sharp that the ordinary technicolor maybe the cast was wrong but in any case the film did to give us idea of the life in ancient egyptin and was in a way the motor to go out and buy the novel my one of the best if not the best historical novel ever published also oust anding was the superb score by alfred newman and bernard herrmann i saw this film many times when i was a boy it was not the big box office hit that fox studios wanted to the robe enormous hit in cinemascope and stereo was a wonderful eye popping i have the lasser disc version m the only way to see ito its format soon i hope will appeared
<START> to solve a challenging problem you need to start by asking the right questions without these even the biggest library of information is useless this movie does just that where other movies guide your thinking along a story board this film pulls at your emotions and your understanding of justice and what's permissible these questions will tug at you throughout challenging your assumptions as the characters develop this movie is important it's relevant and a must see for anybody who stays informed of current affairs the fact it's highly entertaining and includes a slew of movie stars only improves the execution my advice watch it with a serious crowd or better yet by yourself not unlike how you'd read an editorial from your favorite news magazine in this case there is one difference the answers will be your own
<START> the trio are a pleasant nostalgic journey to that first hint of desire when it was still about simple exploration of the unknown before we grew up and added those complexities of hiv status emotional baggage and gotta run my just went off into the emotional mix br br the angst portrayed is pure adolescent angst but it rings true in all three stories their sweetness and positivity make you feel good that you are gay and those kinds of films are few and far between br br good news both boys life and boys life 2 are now readily available on dvd as of september 1999
<START> here he is a new horror icon for the new millennium better than freddy more dangerous than jason vorhees more evil than michael myers hard to believe i know but his time is here br br ray the prick br br yep the antagonist ray is a complete prick this is partly because of the naughty things he does also because he has a scar oh scary on his face but mainly because ray the prick has been milked br br yep ray doesn't channel evil he doesn't even become cursed not even by a voodoo spell nope ray the prick has been milked as deniro once said you can milk anything with nipples and ray has been milked of evil br br how do you milk evil you ask snake nipples i reply snake nipples br br why ray you ask because he's a prick i reply capital p br br watch out for the new line pictures extravaganza entitled freddy vs ray the prick br br thought your new horror saviour was the creeper well not any more cause ray the prick is here and i'm frightened br br pity about the atmosphere less pg 13 unoriginal workmanlike quality of the film though because ray's a star
<START> a genuinely odd surreal jumble of visual ideas which probably looked extremely puzzling on the printed page just what drew robert redford to the project one may never know sidney j furie directs this knockabout journey of an egotistical motorcycle racer taking a milquetoast juvenile under his wing the kid looks up to this anti hero and eventually begins to ape his amorality disjointed and off putting though for some the sight of redford disrobing about to disrobe or having been disrobed might be enough to warrant attention lauren hutton gets naked too however all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the prurient minded there simply is no story perhaps furie was making an esoteric comment about feckless wheelers and their flock circa 1970 if true then this pre blank generation approach backfired as the film was not a success 1 2 from
<START> this movie is a nice cute family oriented film if you don't like violence this is the movie to watch only thing annoying about this movie is the tune but it's a catchy tune repeats whenever c h o m p s leaps in to action
<START> it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job br br hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south the crowd could really care less about the details they are just hell bent on a hanging and despite his commitment to the law the one lawyer in town who has agreed to defend him also assumes he is guilty and doesn't really want to know the truth just delay the hanging until they could try and convict him and then have a legal hanging fortunately a young white man claude begins to wonder about innocence and begins seeking out the truth at this point the best character in this wonderful drama is introduced played by elizabeth patterson the old lady who later played mrs on i love lucy she single handedly steals the show as the white person with not only a conscience but the will and determination to stand up for the black man at one wonderful point in the film a mob is trying to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him but she stands very firm and forces them to back down there is a lot more to this rather complicated but intelligently written story but i'll leave it to you to see it for yourself see it with your kids if you have a chance it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years br br by the way apparently 1949 was a great year for hollywood finally addressing race prejudice head on as twentieth century fox also released pinky an equally effective and strong film about racism interracial marriage and even rape see both films if you can
<START> on the face of it any teen comedy runs the risk of being sophomoric and obvious and fair enough most of them are there are a few that have risen above the usual banality of the source material bring it on and they give me hope that others can join that depressingly rare crowd of teen comedies that are actually funny and not just an excuse to flash some boobs or be a vehicle for some never was like tom green br br enter accepted directed by john cusack pal steve pink and led by the likable justin long the smart nerdy kid in galaxy quest and more recently featured in apple computer ads about a bunch of kids who don't get accepted to college and decide as disclosed in the trailer to fake a bogus one to get their parents off their backs when they go a little too far with the website and other kids end up the kids have a few problems to solve br br okay the set up is obviously preposterous but most comedy lives or dies in the execution and here accepted does pretty well long's bartleby gaines mostly shortened to 'b' is accompanied by enough well meaning comically acceptable friends to help him share the load but probably the best supporting character is lewis no doubt named as an homage to rodney dangerfield's dean martin aka uncle ben lewis black who is wisely restricted to short spurts where he can rapid fire his unique brand of cranky observational humor black is terrific here frankly telling the kids what life is really like his expletive laden final line is hysterical and providing the adult face to the bogus university for the parents br br but long has to carry most of the film and he does so in spades bartleby is easily identified with and we take to him almost immediately a nice twist was provided by columbus short's character hands an athlete who loses his scholarship due to an injury and ends up becoming the de facto art faculty at the fake college also noteworthy as hyper intelligent and sarcastic little sister is hannah marks br br yes the film does feel familiar in some spots there's a debt here owed of all places to revenge of the nerds those who are rejected by everyone else find a home with bartleby and his cohorts and of course the villains are steroid enhanced conformist master race types who run a fraternity well okay frats are evil and seek to humiliate and bury the oddballs for the Â gasp Â crime of being different but that aside accepted has fun with the material and even asks a few decent questions about the expectations on college kids and the course of higher education not that it's a brain teaser by any means but accepted isn't just another mindless teen comedy or owen wilson vehicle it's a funny clever 90 minutes that while not a great departure from its genre is intelligent and creative enough to be very enjoyable br br there is at least one moment of unadulterated brilliance in the film when bartleby checks out a nearby college in an attempt to harvest ideas for his own school's curriculum when he sees that the kids are all stressed out at the other school several refuse to even talk to him during class for fear of missing something he shakes his head thinking that there must be a better way as he moves to leave he is met by a stream of kids going the other way one person moving against a human tide while in the background the opening lines of eleanor rigby play perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance but brilliance none the less
