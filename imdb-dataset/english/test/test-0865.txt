<START> the real problem with this story is that there's not much story to the story there's hardly any plot to speak of widower buys an electric grandma for his kids one kid resists electric grandma then finally accepts her then the kids grow up and grandma leaves really very little happens it's much more of a premise than a story br br moreover strip it of it's schmaltz and you have a story that had already done before and better the lonely same basic idea person initially can't accept the love of a robot because it's just a machine then eventually yields and comes to love the robot the biggest difference is that the lonely is much more powerful as both the protagonist and we the audience are shocked abruptly back to reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot really is just a mechanism br br i also find the story highly flawed in that the electric grandmother is just too perfect she's not only human she's super human she's wiser than a real person she has no traces of to her at all and she makes marbles appear out of thin air it frankly really chafes at credulity to think that she's a machine
<START> russians never dropped children's toys filled with explosives over afghanistan that never happened who did invention of that hollywood portrays russian army as horrible dreadful troops of evil that is disgusting united states president jimmy carter had accepted the view that soviet aggression could not be viewed as an isolated event of limited geographical importance but had to be contested as a potential threat to the persian gulf region the uncertain scope of the final objective of moscow in its sudden plunge made the american stake in an independent pakistan all the more important a great deal of damage was done to the civilian children population by land mines
<START> jud nelson is an aspiring actor who becomes involved with a married couple who enjoy playing sadistic games on other people the husband gets his jollies by burying people alive if that isn't bad enough he has a miniature video camera in each coffin so he can watch his victims suffocate
<START> hey guy this movies is everything about choices all the times in your life you must pick something or it just pass away and this movie prove that of course life in fact is not like a beautiful picture as this movie shows it not shows indeed but some may figure that i'm trying to say it's full of pain love and deep lessons of live aaron the mormon missionary is the real shepherd digging out the thing beautiful deep inside the skin feeling guy br br it's a great end and you do always believe in fate because it will surprise you in a turn or in other of your live like latter days br br big deal watch it
<START> okay it's a movie for children and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well however there are some unintentionally funny moments most of them involving holes in the story for example the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal and he doesn't have the money so does he ask his father for the dough nope he steals it and gets caught kids if i'm ever turned invisible i'll advance your allowance ok also while this kid is at the police station no doubt about to be charged with criminally lame acting his beautiful blond teacher comes in announces who she is and where she works then busts the child out of the slam in front of the cops to make matters worse instead of making a quick getaway they then sit in the parking lot of the police station and laugh about their achievement you know i hate to pick but the kid did steal something and ought to face the consequences but maybe being in this movie is punishment enough y'all avoid it
<START> from the crash of the opening theme the man with the golden arm is classic 1950's entertainment no subtlety here frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and goes right back to the old neighborhood where the old scumbags still lurk this is a tale of his dark ride with all of his emotional baggage intact the performances are all a bit overripe but that's part of the fun of watching darren mcgavin and arnold are unforgettable and almost steal the show this and the manchurian candidate are the two greatest chairman of the board films in my humble opinion don't miss either one of them
<START> with a little dressing up this movie could be served for thanksgiving dinner not only is is boring implausible historically inaccurate and poorly directed the best actors were the bit players mainly because they had so few lines to say a waste of time even for war fanatics
<START> ted danson was a great choice to play gulliver even though his background was mostly comedy he shows here that he can do drama just as well or perhaps even better though there is a lot of humour in this hard to turn a blind eye to his american accent especially since his character is supposed to be english but that's just a minor thing br br all the villains are equally well cast james fox edward fox peter o'toole warwick davis john standing etc despite the fact that most of them are either tiny people or giants they are 100 believable in everything they do and their motivations are very clear e g the unremitting suspicion of gulliver the giant dwarf's hatred of him for usurping his position as court jester dr bates' attempt to have gulliver proved insane so he can marry mary br br mary steenburgen is great as mary gulliver another 17th century english character with an american accent but never mind she is a deeply tormented character because she has been waiting nine years for her husband to return home and when he finally does he is talking about tiny people giants a flying island and talking horses mary despite the strong fantasy element in the story is a very believable character br br the special effects are breathtaking especially when you consider that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when cgi was in its infancy it looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city filled with people who are 6 inches tall br br the cameos are great as well omar sharif richard wilson sir john gielgud kristin scott thomas ned beatty all great actors who create a strong supporting cast that complement superb acting ability br br the and the yahoos are probably the most effective element of the story on the satire side of things a society of talking horses who do not possess any of the vices that humans have while the yahoos are primitive disgusting humans who mate forcefully and appoint their leader depending on how disgusting he is gulliver and study of them is also very well done and displays the differences and similarities between humans and yahoos br br the best version of gulliver's travels by far and one of the best mini series ever
<START> first of all i have to say that i am not generally a big fan of werewolf movies in general it's not that i don't like them just that i don't like them a lot there are some that i have enjoyed werewolf of london 1935 stuart walker an american werewolf in london 1981 john landis and some that i have thought were okay but nothing special the wolf man 1941 george the howling 1981 joe dante dog soldiers 2002 neil marshall are some examples but overall the werewolf sub genre is not my favorite but i had this one on one of those 50 movie sets so i thought i'd give it a watch and see how it was br br spoilers follow br br the mad monster is a werewolf tale but the werewolf is primarily used as a vehicle for revenge by a mad scientist dr lorenzo cameron george zucco dr cameron has discovered a way to transform human beings into beasts specifically wolves but was ridiculed and ostracized by the greater scientific community forced out of a prestigious position he goes mad and plots revenge on those who mocked him in an old country mansion where he lives with his daughter the lovely anne and his assistant glenn strange of limited mental abilities using his serum dr cameron transforms into a werewolf and sends him off to kill his old rivals eventually though the werewolf gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed br br the movie also plays out somewhat as a murder crime drama with journalist suitor johnny downs investigating the doctor's strange behavior and the rash of murders the story seems to borrow many elements from other big pictures that came before it there are reminders of frankenstein 1931 james whale in the creation of a monster which runs amok and the creature killing an innocent child visions of dr jekyll and mr hyde 1931 mamoulian or the 1941 victor fleming version and the wolf man 1941 george also come to mind and that is one of the problems with this movie in my view it comes across as a mediocre melding of some great films it doesn't add much to the genre br br true there are some redeeming qualities george performance was convincing and the scene showing dr lorenzo talking to his visions hallucinations of his tormentors works well for me in showing his insanity there is some reasonable character build up at least in the case of his character but glenn character is not at all convincing and seems to have this comedic quality whether intentional or not i'm not sure that just doesn't fit into the movie as a whole br br i seemed to like it more than most imdb users based on my rating of 4 10 but it was still a below average film perhaps worth a view if you are a fan of early werewolf movies or a big fan of the 1930's and 1940's horror films but unlikely to appeal to you if you are not
<START> i can't believe they even released such a movie the only good acting came from the water in the movie this has to be one of worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen br br the only scary part of the movie is the bad acting me giving this movie a 1 is me being to kind this movie deserve a 0 br br the storyline and if you can call it the plot of the movie seems to have been written by an high school kid you have to ask yourself if it may have been better with better actors in it br br do yourself a favor wait for it to show on tv br br and even then watching it will be a wast of time
<START> thats right i can't watch comedy central anymore just because i can't bear to watch the repeated commercials for this show i'll tell you the truth this is a terrible show not because i'm offended by it but because carlos mencia is one of the worst comedians i have ever seen i rather watch carrot top do a george bush impression than watch this no skill hack and to believe he calls himself the greatest even if he didn't steal the jokes he is still bad at telling them he's way off timing and unoriginal i remember in one joke he said why do white people go camping to pretend there poor for a week now what is that suppose to mean that all white people are rich another one i didn't understand was when he did a skit of the price is right and he told some fat guy you should know how much a fridge cost you're fat and the fat guy had the saddest look on his face but what does that mean that fat people are always looking for refrigerators those are just the two i seen in his commercials god knows what his show is like br br this show falls in the likes of epic movie and date movie
<START> just when i thought nothing could be as offensive and or irritating as a billy mays infomercial i had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage peter barnes and john irvin should be brought up on criminal charges for smuggling this script into the public venue the actors need to be charged as accomplices serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye br br this production offers the disclaimer for dramatic effect we have taken poetic license with certain facts or some such inadequate statement to fully brace you for the absolute repugnant rewrite of a bible story which needed no drama added what they did add was enough to make your i q drop three full points for every five minutes of viewing time br br the poetic license taken invents characters so bizarre you'll recognize nothing but the names of a few and of course the ark br br for some reason noah and lot are both living in so maybe was vacationing in switzerland on a skiing trip lot's wife played by carol kane is a harpy and when she's turned to a pillar of salt lot breaks off her finger and carries it around in what appears to be an empty baby food jar if that's poetic i'm a br br when noah who has now begun drinking wine in quantities that could help float the ark whines about the tough job of the building project he awakens one morning to find that god has delivered enough lumber to lighten his burden at least i think it was god it looked like a delivery from 84 lumber neatly stacked and bundled maybe 84 lumber is really an agent for god rather than bore you with the cargo being loaded i'll you with the account of the pirate attack on the ark incongruous you think this movie is filled with such insulting nonsense after an untold time on the waters noah spies a pirate ship heading right for them and who might the salty sea captain be well duh it's lot of course my only surprise was that his uncle wasn't aboard if you're going to slaughter a plot line slaughter all of it the piracy attempt is unsuccessful and the swashbuckling was pathetic not poetic i think it was around this mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself anymore br br an ugly senseless moronic distortion of anything remotely resembling a bible account on a scale of 1 10 this movie is premeditated mind abuse stupid and insulting you'll be more entertained by reading the yellow pages
<START> this film oh my god this film is so poor i'm amazed i managed to watch it all br br first off id like to say that vinny jones should only play a london thug period that's it end of story br br is so unconvincing its almost comedy banging in dennis hopper and david carradine did not save this film in fact i think its a total comedy and as a comedy it deserves its 1 star br br avoid at all costs vinny oh my god i thought i saw it all when he played that irish tinker p br br i think the average viewer will realize that this film is maybe just a never will be type of film i cant see how anybody could actually fall this crap
<START> i also attended the ri international horror film festival and i can easily see why this film won best of show br br sea of dust is a wild romp of horror comedy and beautiful scenery a back in time tale of strange goings on an increasingly wide spread illness with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of people's heads exploding brings a young professor's apprentice stefan to investigate along his travels he decides to briefly detour and once again ask for his long time love's hand in marriage only to once again be sent packing by her extremely stubborn fatherÂ along the way out of town he comes across an ill girl in the road and delivers her to dr maitland brilliantly played by up and coming vincent price like actor edward x young who fills stefan in on the evils a foot only the dr is insulted that he had called for the professor and only received a boy in the less stefan turns out to be much more than a common bystander horror icon tom savini portrays the ultimate religious torment monger john scream queen ingrid pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance as anna many beautiful and talented supporting actors seamlessly held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax br br dark religion and over the top but fun and sometimes very original gore scenes play heavily in this hammer tribute flick this stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks surreal worlds dreams and the character's reality br br horror and gore aside this is also a very funny movie slapstick tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line like others have stated this really is like three great movies in one very entertaining and original
<START> what can be said about this truly one of the most mind numbing experiences of my life your brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self preservation i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way i mean this in a terrible way a terrible way br br this film has no redeeming features everything is appalling artless camera work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable i e lots of corn lots of mud the story is beyond stupid the script there a script the villain is severely unscary and wears yellow wellington boots the kids are annoying the lead man is charisma free and it has the audacity to go on for 100 minutes utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture normally such a statement would be an exaggeration meant for comical effect not in this case i'll even say it again Â this is torture br br at the end i was in a state of paralysis this was brief thankfully but once i recovered i decided i had to watch the 'making of' featurette i had to understand maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity was it all an elaborate joke i watched the first 2 minutes of the 'making of' featurette and discovered that the writer director was to put it mildly somewhat misguided i also discovered that because i had taken time out to watch the first two minutes of the 'making of' featurette of dark harvest 2 that i was an idiot not a pleasant voyage of self discovery life sucks br br highly unrecommended
