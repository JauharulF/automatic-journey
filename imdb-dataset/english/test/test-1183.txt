<START> this movie is very long but totally worth splitting up over several nights it has an all star cast and if you are a patrick swayze fan this will get your heart to throbbing my mother is a civil war buff and a history teacher and every summer we would watch this movie we had recorded it off tv over several several nights until we got through the whole thing we had every line in the movie memorized lol pop some popcorn sit back and enjoy the action and romance it's a great movie for those that like action war blood guts but also for those with a soft romantic side the clothes the women wore were gorgeous sometimes i think i was born in the wrong era lol
<START> i was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as frontline or fog of war by errol morris instead i was appalled by this shallow and naive account of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime alberto this movie should be called the return of the director presumes she made a perfect movie because alienates both pro and anti factions when in fact it is a very biased and unprofessional piece of work br br the movie has few crucial facts wrong br br 1 she uses the so called landslide election of 1995 in which was re elected with 65 of the vote as an example of the massive popular support of but we all now know to be the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud br br 2 the movie states that shining path killed 60 000 people in fact the truth final report states that there were 69 280 deaths due to political violence in peru 33 of those were caused by sl that leaves the other 67 in the hands of the police military and other groups the fact that she uses the same misleading information that has been using for 10 years it is another example of how terrible this movie is br br for any person with some education on peruvian politics and history is clearly a consummated manipulator a delusional character and remorseless egomaniac his regime was very far from being democratic he is still a menace to peruvians despite these facts the director lets tell the story not only on how he wants the camera to be positioned but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda he always seems to have the last word there are no journalistic cojones just soft questions and unchallenged remarks where is when we need her the director when questioned after the screening didn't hide the fact that she was deeply impressed by his charm and intelligence yes she has been definitely charmed by him and you can tell by looking at this film it's obvious she has a very hard time to digest the multitude of facts that point towards his responsibility on the corruption murder and deception that took place she assured the gasping audience that was really a patriot when few moments earlier one of the leading peruvian journalists was very adamant in telling us that was above all a traitor she went on to say that despite all the accusations not a single dollar was found on any bank account on his name etc etc it was like hearing again the same gang of ruthless thugs that ruled the country for 10 years defending their master it was a sad moment for journalism br br this film makes injustice to history it is an insult to hundreds of dead people disappeared or unjustly incarcerated by regime no wonder she later confessed that all the peruvian intellectuals she befriended while making the movie felt betrayed by it unbiased the words naÃ¯ve and denial come to my mind instead
<START> having seen just about every movie on record that a child of the eighties could have seen this ranks at the very very very bottom of the heap of bad movies i have ever seen it's depressing and just plain painful to watch nuff said
<START> the film had it moments but was disappointing in my eyes anyway it was a reworking of trespass walter hill and so the treasure of the sierra madre with less tension bite and human emotion there was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth i watched the movie for mr reno and mr fishburn neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for this movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies for an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill better than watching snow fall but not for me
<START> every time i watch larry king live he rolls out the most softball questions for his guests he rarely gets any useful information because he doesn't ask the hard questions this comes from his start on radio br br king established himself on the radio and basically has not changed one bit of the format for television except for his talking head being visible he becomes like a puppy for his guests the only time he really gets useful information from them is whee they volunteer it or a caller to the show actually asks a hard question br br larry is a nice fatherly type of interviewer this means he should not have a prime time show on a major news network if you consider cnn one i don't because of the history of cnn br br copying ie cable new network was started by ted turner as an alternative to network news in that it could broadcast news 24 7 when it first started the only tv competition was from nbc abc cbs because of this cnn copied the format of their competition achieved respectable ratings br br this worked fine for cnn until they got competing networks which were innovative provided better fresher news coverage in response to the heating up of competition cnn went into denial panned its competitors who were eating their lunch ratings because cnn wanted to resist change this didn't work very long their ratings began to plummet br br now the copying news network is trying to re mold itself by re inventing itself by copying the leading news network format unfortunately this show represents a big piece of the problem it is 21 years old showing it's age very badly br br sorry to say king needs to be moved out of prime time or scrapped altogether
<START> 210 minute version extremely hardcore or so i hear or the r rated version released into theaters both are terribly awful of course peter o'toole and malcolm mcdowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film the latter of the two men reported this in an imdb interview and i can see why nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half hearted attempt at a plot br br not much of anything here other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes i liked what mcdowell himself said about the film it was like one moment i'd be staring admiring my mule or something and the next scene would be two lesbians going at it br br how true br br what an awful movie br br 1 5 stars
<START> the first season of bones is playing in finland and i can't believe the amount of bullshit that this show puts on the characters are shallow poorly directed and clumsy br br it's a poor mans' csi or actually csi without coherent plot although bones has potential it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasn't been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors it's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a pinch more thought from the start you get the feeling how awkward the acting is br br long story short don't waste your time on bones
<START> i like vampire movies i like b movies i love b vampire movies but this one has nearly nothing going for it some of the acting is horrible especially by 3 of the male leads the story is not particular interesting at a relative short 88 minutes it still seems too long and you'll find yourself fast forwarding quite a bit there are an awful lot of kung fu vampire attacks sound cool it isn't when it's done on a low budget it gets repetitive very quickly there is some minor blood and gore nothing to get excited about there some good wire work where you can see the wires it has some good landscapes being filmed in puerto rico br br not worth the rental
<START> my friend gives me these 3 huge boxes they're laserdiscs of flash gordon serials he says i'm gonna have some giant coasters i say but not so this serial rocks but i had to whine moan to almost everyone i knew to find a laserdisc player for em br br there is really a little of everything in this serial there are lion men hawk men shark men i guess you'd call em men the sets costumes combine greek roman oriental egyptian and there's even armour like english knights awesome costumes and some of it was a riot those horrible tights with shorts over em worn by are beyond description and the guys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxers br br it's also funny the way they renamed the octopus to an the orangutan to and the tiger to a there's even a dragon a godzilla like creature who threatens flash on a couple of occasions before being killed off br br you like the invisible man this has got you covered you like sword fights wrestling both animals men fist fights plenty for any taste we have an underwater city a sky city a city on top of a mountain and tonnes of secret passages and caves br br hokey effects massive amounts the sky city is supported by radium furnaces stoked like old time the are powered by fireworks and have constant backfires and or humming noises lots of wires are visible holding things up like food when flash was invisible and of course there's clouds out in space but none around the earth when viewed from giant lizards show up briefly fighting sea creatures supposedly threaten flash co on the way to the shark men's underwater city the gadgets in dr lab crack me up and they seem to be the same ones no matter what lab he's in he worked in ming's lab and br br and yeah we have romance everyone wants dale ming flash but at least one person wanted princess aura prince baron just not the person she would have preferred in fact it seems a lot of the sub plots concern intrigue on the part of princess aura to try to win flash br br man i think the characters are awesome that fat horse laughing king was hilarious how he managed those wings was pure artistry and ming what can i say about ming he was perfect they should have had him for the emperor in ming has got to be my favourite character in this serial princess aura was quite a little character too and she pulled it off nicely i think she's a better actress than dale arden by a long shot even the sneaky high priest had a distinctive role was good but not the strongest character and he always stood in the background during fight scenes holding dale now we get to flash flash of course was the strong point the leader the hero and he did it well crabbe is a good actor and this role fit him perfectly br br after watching this i think i know where george lucas got the main idea for watch this you'll see what i mean br br if you ever considered watching an old serial or any serial for that matter this should be your first choice the only reason i didn't give this one a 10 is because of a few story holes that could have been fixed easily the way the giant lizards seemed just tacked in there and a couple of weak characters king of shark men king of lion men
<START> mullholland drive proves once again that david lynch is the master of cinematic expression at the screening last night i witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema the performances are astounding the score entrancing and the photography mesmerizing david's ability to weave the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is as i watched mullholland drive i couldn't help but realize that with david lynch in this world we are truly blessed the cinema is blessed as well for in the films of david lynch we are shown that one man's vision can be realized with stunning results we realize that blockbusters are not the only path we realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and in that we are blessed indeed
<START> there is a reason why the world forgot these creatures they are dull this is a hammer production which means that whoever made this movie should be struck with a hammer several times if possible and where it most hurts most people put more thought into taking a dump than these idiots have put into making this movie br br seriously the movie begins with some cavemen hunting an thing now antelopes must have evolved a lot from those pre historic times because they actually attack and kill people here after that it's time to meet the rest of the tribe more bearded men some fashion models and even a couple of very old grey haired grannies and these old geezers obviously never heard about cave people not surpassing the age of 30 they refused to bow to the will of both logic and pre historical records so they remain alive one of the cavemen isn't bearded he is clean shaven not quite as clean shaven as tarzan the lord of the humanoid clean shaven ones roaming the jungle since childhood and without a razor but thereabouts br br what follows is the obligatory earthquake molten lava destruction sequence which causes a lot of our not so hairy friends to meet their doom it is interesting to note that before the earthquake the fashion models showed their breasts more after it they must have gotten shy or something because they covered their chests for a while maybe they were covered by ash so i mistakenly thought they were covered more action follows in the form of two fashion models wrestling in the sand the next best thing to female mud wrestling i suppose after a good deal of the desert has been crossed our black haired tribe meets how else could it be a blond tribe yawn br br more spellbinding stuff follows there is that redhead fashion model who is bothered by seeing a cave teen kill a hedge hog thing there is also the scene of a woman dying at birth those cave fashion models are so frail eventually we get to meet an even darker haired and skinned tribe i e an evil tribe one of them becomes a wwf champion after he actually beats a huge bear thing in a wrestling bout 1 2 3 and it's done the bear is the loser we also witness a jealous caveman miraculously recover from two major injuries first he gets stabbed with a big spear into the thigh yet he walks away from that as if it were but a scratch then he gets thrown off a cliff onto a big rock by the blond goodie two shoes caveman yet he walks away from it as if he were thrown onto a giant sofa it's unclear in the end whether he dies from falling off an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll being crushed oh yes voodoo was used in pre historic times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashion models it's always important to learn from movies br br the message of the movie is as insightful as it is educational cave people liked to fight for local power and they loved their fashion models too as if any self respecting caveman would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch
<START> yes this is one of the better done television movies and i wouldn't expect less from joe sargent one thing for this reviewer is that i was also a great fan of the carpenters i got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and i got to do much of the solo material of which karen sang lead i thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's and being a child teen singing these songs and learning music the one thing i was looking forward to was meeting this woman i never got to she died three weeks before that was to happen and yes that did effect me for i knew nothing of anorexia and could not understand completely what happened br br when this tv movie got produced i got quite an understanding maybe not everything in karen and richard's life is open to the television audience but in opening the parts that were shown i got to understand much from the music industry of that time what upsets me is that i am writing of that time and seeing now no one has learned a darned thing even though this was a very informative and heartfelt look into a family's problems in the music industry br br these films aren't done for fun they're done to open a door and show us something here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the whole idea that her talent was based on weight she was fine didn't know it she got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved the parents she loved and the music industry that cared more about her looks weight than the talent within with the onset of mtv it got worse with 'american it's like a puss festering in an english accent br br a wonderful tv film i am sure later someone may give it an hbo treatment but either way many lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent
<START> a refreshing interview with the legendary italian cinematographer producer director who passed away in 1999 with close to 200 features to his credit as director a large portion is spent on d'amato's softcore sex films including his notorious emanuelle entries with laura gemser they also briefly cover his porn career which kept him afloat during his last decade or so more interesting to me is the section focusing on his horror and action efforts d'amato has plenty of great anecdotes about actors and his low budget film making including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones amid the fake ones while shooting in a 2 000 year old other interviewees include george eastman and al cliver i would have liked a bit more conversation about his stateside filmirage productions not a single question about troll 2 granted it wasn't the cult film then it was now
<START> charlie chaplin's little tramp or little man character wins world war i called the great war at the time single handedly even capturing the kaiser something the entire allied armed forces were unable to do too bad it all turns out to be a dream which is somewhat of a cop out and the weakest part of this mesmerizing silent short almost a feature film at 46 minutes br br there are inventive gags galore including charlie having to put on a gas mask to eat limburger cheese sent from home then using the cheese as a weapon against the germans charlie sleeping underwater in a flooded trench next to a soldier he continues to annoy charlie disguising himself as a tree one of his best sketches ever and charlie pretending to beat up his friend who has become a pow then hugging him when the enemy is out of sight br br one amazing feature is how much charlie when he is behind enemy lines dressed as a german resembles hitler over ten years before hitler and his nazi thugs rose to dominate german politics obviously hitler patterned his appearance after charlie's from this film
<START> the movie touches the soul of the audience very much some scene in the movie is ultimate and tears comes out automatically i'm surprised by seeing this movie that any director can direct this type of movie in the year 1925 as a student of cinema i can say this movie helps a lot to understand use of montage first time when our teacher told us about this movie means genre of this movie we thought nothing could be there in this movie to understand but finally when sir explained it then we came to know how great this movie is lastly i can say it helps a lot understanding films and being a cinema student i can the viewers that they can see this movie
