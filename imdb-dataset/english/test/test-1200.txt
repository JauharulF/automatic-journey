<START> to me this film is just a very very lame teen party movie with all the normal clichÃ©s and boring stereotyped characters nerds jocks popular girls guys etc but with an underlying anti drug drinking theme br br if you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this film keep an eye out for all the references to responsibility and keeping it real dunno how else to word it i guess the only thing that'd make this film cool would be if they tv playing it was on fire that or dvd it was on exploded br br 1 out of watch animal house instead
<START> the action scenes was quite good but the plot of the movie i would have to give it a score of 1 out of 10 it seems that the producers and director of this movie didn't thought about it carefully br br it doesn't give much value and values to it's viewers except for it's violence the entire story was about revenge a boy witnessing a rape and murder i would even recommend it to be banned those who watched it you've just lose some money if you're thinking of watching it watch something else i would ask for a refund if i was on a movie theater so for you guys and girls out there reading this article please don't waste time
<START> lucille ball tries to look 30 years younger than she actually was in this poor excuse for a musical br br the movie features some of the worst choreography ever seen laced with the constant threat that lucy might break into song with her bourbon voice at any moment lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before it can begin and aside from die hard lucy fans no one is likely to fancy it very much bad costumes and cheesy set designs don't help further proof that lucy wasn't good at anything except making stupid faces br br directed by gene saks
<START> when i was a younger oh about 2 i watched barney for the first time and liked it but back then i didn't exactly have a brain either and now i look back and see what a horrible show barney really is first of all everything on that show is creepy barney the main character is a horrendous 9 foot tall talking purple dinosaur that teaches 13 year olds about imagination shudders b j i know what your thinking about his name is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be cool but in fact he is the exact opposite after watching a few episodes with b j dumbly trudging in with his slightly turned back cap and making a few no so funny jokes i wanted to scream baby bop oh oh god vomits oh oh oh anyway baby bop is the worst idea of a character ever she is a green triceratops it's a dinosaur that carries a yellow blanket her remarks of hee hee hee and barney's praises cries of 'super make it hard to sit through each episode as the seventh graders learn about shapes and manners br br and that my friend is what makes this show truly horrible
<START> what's the most violent movie of all time rambo iii commando robocop add these three very violent together and you still won't equal the carnage in the the wildest silliest craziest action movie i have ever seen for one hundred minutes things blow up and people die in dozens of strange ways it will make you laugh and cheer and when it's all over you'll be more than a little exhausted this movie is a buried gem a cult classic sadly lacking a cult br br the is the nickname of our hero peter peter o'brian a large oily man with a curly mullet he arrives in indonesia on the trail of the villainous and mean greg rainmaker we know he is evil because he is only referred to by his full name i hate scum like greg rainmaker and utilizes a method of killing that is so horrible i can't even utter it here wait yes i can he steps on people in spiky shoes greg rainmaker killer br br when greg rainmaker isn't pouring alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure he's kidnapping important professors and heading a huge underworld empire it's up to a jewish action hero and his motley crew of sidekicks to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing lots of stuff up maybe stabilize has a different meaning in indonesia br br and the violence oh the violence this is a film unwilling nay of letting five minutes of screen time go by without some sort of explosion car crash or squib interrupting the dialogue the violence is extreme not graphic and bloody just really weird for example the company invade one of warehouses by driving through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle of course when perched on the balcony with heavy fire coming from below the does the one thing he can do he drives off the balcony into the guy's head his front tire bouncing off it like a basketball astounding br br from the overly gratuitous love scenes both major female characters hop in the sack with the hero of their choice not two minutes after they speak to them alone for the first time to the poorly dubbed dialogue victor you talented bastard the has it all this is a film for the ages right up there with citizen kane and gymkata it is not widely available in release if you find it anywhere for any price buy it and relish the insanity br br
<START> i saw a version of this in a 4 dvd mafia collection put out by brentwood and i have to admit that it was a good film the quality was a little worse for the wear but it was a well acted and realistic drama involving low level new jersey gangsters pesci once again though steels the show
<START> mildly entertaining and self consciously cheezy but what else could it possibly be cushing in one of his poorest roles and he often sounds dubbed mcclure is just too cheezy to be believed but who can blame him in the wasteland of this movie whose plot about ancient dinosaur birds ruling humans has 19th century throwback period charm but not enough and unfortunately the script carries the racist connotations of the literary genre into films nice effort from the actors but a poorly conceived production
<START> harry langdon's saturday afternoon is often ranked among the greatest silent comedies at least where short subjects are concerned and therefore may come as a bit of a letdown for some unlike some of the other recognized classics such as keaton's cops or chaplin's the immigrant this film is in some respects a familiar conventional situation comedy and doesn't offer much in the way of belly laughs one may even wonder whether langdon belongs in such rarefied company nonetheless in my opinion it's a perfectly charming comedy in its minor key way and harry is fascinating to watch br br for a modern viewer raised on tv sitcoms the plot of saturday afternoon may suggest the honeymooners or its many spin offs two dim guys one of whom is married and very much under his wife's thumb try to sneak out with a couple of good time girls for a fun afternoon but everything goes wrong and they wind up having to fight the girls' tough guy boyfriends does this sound familiar and perhaps a little dreary well the premise was already shopworn when this film was made but beyond that nothing about langdon was typical he was odd starting with the fact that he looked like a middle aged baby who was half asleep any freudians who catch saturday afternoon will have a field day with the scenes between this timid pudgy faced baby man and his stern gently domineering mommy wife when harry tries to hide money under the rug but she catches him in the act and forces him to hand it over you'd swear you're watching an interaction between a 6 year old boy and his mama and maybe that's why harry langdon gave some people the creeps and still does br br but he's a compelling screen figure and it's not what he does so much as the way he does it in that scene with the coins under the rug for instance harry finds the coins by placing one foot before the other carefully like a tightrope walker counting off his paces until he finds the right spot and his technique is hypnotic langdon moved like no one else whether or not he makes you laugh the guy is mesmerizing seemingly in a world of his own where the plot of his films is concerned harry is curiously passive and almost never drives the story forward himself in the finale of saturday afternoon when the big fistfight is taking place harry's co star vernon dent is in the thick of the action but harry is in a daze for much of the time and winds up sort of punch drunk between two cars sitting on the running board of one but with his feet on the other while they race through the streets it's a memorable image and as the critic walter kerr wrote it encapsulates langdon's screen persona quite perfectly he's a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of frantic action blinking while the world rushes past it's also worth noting that langdon and dent who worked together frequently have a rapport in this movie that suggests a blueprint laurel hardy would follow when they teamed up a year or so later langdon's style was a likely influence on stan laurel especially here br br saturday and its star may not be for everyone but the film is well worth a look and you might find that langdon makes an impression that's hard to shake
<START> i saw this at the screening at gencon in indy i had some time to kill and decided to check it out it played to about 1000 people in a packed standing room only ballroom br br wow what a ride the script was tight the action tense the pacing perfect the character exposition excellent one thing i really appreciated was that you knew going in that this wasn't a big budget film yet it soon became obvious that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could despite their limitations and it was more than enough br br it's true that this film was targeted at a certain audience gamers tabletop players the creators make no effort to hide that but other filmmakers could learn a lot from them for in going for the jugular in scene after scene and not worrying about if mom who happens to be watching will get it they got the biggest laughs time and time again but there's enough universality there that mom will be laughing too even if she's not in on every joke i think too many times i see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator so that they will appeal to the most people but the movie just ends up suffering for it br br but not this flick indeed this film was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around it's finger from the opening credits and while the viewers around me really wanted to like the film they weren't pushovers gamers can be among the most critical niche out there br br i'm so glad i got to see this in a big crowd at least 10 times the audience was having such a good time that they erupted into applause at a joke or scene during the film how often does that happen at screenings it should be no surprise that there was a huge standing ovation when the closing credits rolled br br for my own part i can't wait for this to be released after it ended one of the producers said they were shooting for a simultaneous tv dvd release that date cannot come soon enough
<START> anthony wong plays lok a husband whose wife is seriously ill poor lok due to her illness he has been going without sex for a long time that's why he is plagued by a series of sleazy nightmares featuring nurses and schoolgirls erotic nightmare is a fun cat iii flick loaded with sleaze and voyeurism there is also a bit of gore as the first part of the film shows some nasty killings committed by wong character under the influence of the monk's mystical powers the dream sequences are quite erotic and sleazy so i'm not complaining of course those who expect gruesome cat iii horror in the tradition of diary of a serial killer or red to kill will be disappointed but fans of sleazy exploitation cinema should give this one a look 7 out of 10
<START> this movie is a bad movie but after watching an endless series of bad horror movies i can say that it is a little different from many i have seen not in the plot which is a fairly regular slasher story but more the way the scenes are cut murder weapon gives us a lot of inane dialogue scenes but they go on for a lot longer than in most movies of this type because of this some of the victims seem slightly less like cardboard cut outs just slightly i had a difficult time figuring out exactly what was happening at the beginning and kept wondering if certain events were dream sequences my favorite scene is when two guys are on the run from the killer and take refuge in a car in the glove compartment they find a handgun thank you god one of them happily exclaims that guy's head suddenly looks like a head and it went on for just enough time for me to wonder what is that where is that mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car then boom the head explodes and i figured out that it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car getting his head shot off with a shotgun i love that scene but the movie is a very bad movie 3 10
<START> i am being in no way facetious when i say that this movie was worse than any other movie ever made worse than batman robin worse than manos hands of fate seriously it's that bad when people tell me that a movie is terrible i use the two girls scale to figure it out if the movie is comparable to two girls then i won't watch it if it's twice as good maybe i'll watch it but only to laugh at the retards who paid somebody to make it because a movie twice as good as this one would still be a piece of garbage
<START> i felt sorry enough that this film is not popular at all even in hong kong however for all die hard chow's fan this will be a masterpiece that shud not b left out this is mo lei a comedy style that based on unrealistic and ridiculous plot pioneered by chow at its peak the plot is totally absolutely ultimately 1000 times more ridiculous than any film that u can imagine the dialog is awesome no single part of the film cool down for u to stop laughing br br the plot look simple but crazy for u to start laughing it begin with chow starring a junior magistrate a corrupted one of course caught into jail when helping an innocent married woman he love at first sight to clear her from a murder charge that plot by evil minister whose son was actually the real convict chow escape from jail and run away as a refugee he intend to go to the capital to see the emperor and report the conviction on his way he manage to pick up 2 lovely women one from circus another one a prostitute while in the mean time mastering supreme skill to quarrel and bad mouth from the thin mama san who happen to be his future in law finally he able to force the emperor to re open the case by black mail the emperor whom he meet him in the brothel the emperor made him a highest level judge to judge the case with the evil minister he manage to setup some brilliant but hilarious plots to force the convict to commit the crime execute him while thrown the evil minister to jail br br the plots are really hilarious and ridiculously brilliant also not to forget the tremendous dialog that include some brilliant bad mouth quarrel between chow and the mama san quarrel between the fat mama san and thin mama san to inspire chow to learn the quarrel skill later and also quarrel between chow and the evil eunuch lee near the ending beside that some of the scenes are brilliant too br br one thing that need to mention is that to really understand the film and catch up 100 of all the elements correctly this will be a must to master cantonese really well which may be the reason why early age chow movie receive moderate response only from asian world however when chow film began to spread his influence around the globe hardcore fans like me found that his film is no more that funny like the old time
<START> i first saw this movie in the mid 80's and thought it was a funny movie as i have gotten older i watch this movie for different reasons i like to view it when i'm feeling sad nostalgic for my lost youth i was a teenager 14 at the time of the release of this film so i can identify with many of the same problems dilemmas that the campers in this movie have i enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip the film is also full of funny one liners i highly recommend this movie to anyone that was a teenager in the late 70's to early 80's
