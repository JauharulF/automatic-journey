<START> this was a wonderful little film that truly was creative and fun something you see all too seldom in movies the film begins in russia just after the fall of the communist government as a result society seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone dirty cities crime and lack of housing still plague the poor residents of st petersburg br br into this scene of bleakness and uncertainty comes an idealistic music teacher he is among those without a home and he finally gets a letter from the government that tells him he has a tiny room in a nearby flat when he arrives the place is a mess but the people seem friendly enough so they all have a lovely party in the middle of the night they are awakened by an old lady walking out of the giant wardrobe in the room i was half expecting lucy and the other kids from the lion the witch and the wardrobe to come out but they didn't they are too shocked to do anything at first but decide soon to investigate instead of just being a clothes closet the wardrobe opens into paris how the residents of the flat respond to this magical gateway is really intriguing some like the music teacher are thrilled and in awe most of the others are more pragmatic and are mostly concerned with looting everything from paris before the gateway closes once and for all these russian thieves are awful people greedy coarse and crude but down deep very deep are hearts of gold i like how this is a metaphor for the nation now on the brink of capitalism at first they run amok grabbing everything they can and only later do they reveal some depth but mostly they act much like guests on the jerry springer show the film has many twists and turns and is both funny and mesmerizing about the only negative is that due to some harsh language and a nude scene albeit a very funny one this is not a film for kids this is a real shame as with some very minor editing this could have been a great family film
<START> i love camp movies believe me and the usual gore of gordon lewis don't bother me at all but this is just one of his most stupid movies even more than blood feast i'm not kidding the gore gore girls is about a mad person who kills a lot of go re go re girls of a night club a detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual average acting h g lewis films but that is not saying much the camera work is even dreadful br br but at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting you going to pass a good time with it and the killings are just absurd in a very very bad way a girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her butt and just don't let me talk about what it does with the nipples you going to laugh like anyone with this but the better of all this mess is a scene that i only love of it's the go go girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists dancing in a very american way though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an x rating because of it's violence br br only if you want lo laugh and pass a good time but only with a lot a lot of beers
<START> if you like shoot em up westerns this is a keeper i thought that the movie was fun to watch and to see folks that i have not seen in a while i am no expert but i liked the acting the town and props etc seemed to fit the period and kind of town that you would find out on the frontier this is not an a western not enough people and budget the costumes and firearms were correct for the time i expect to see the young actors in the film again in the future rachel chance and kirby were great the sass single action shooting society members that contributed to this effort were pretty darn good hope to see more
<START> well i generally like iranian movies and after having seen 10 by kiarostami the night before i was expecting a great movie i was very disappointed this is by far the worst iranian film and one of the most boring asian movies i have ever seen if you have never seen a kiarostami movie before watch ten instead if you want some good iranian movies you may also try aka the apple this movie is divided in 5 parts and only the fourth featuring some funny ducks is worth watching if this is the first iranian movie you see you probably won't want to see any more i don't blame you but you will miss some great movies
<START> i saw this with my with my kids they love it but i don't she did not get run overfed by a reindeer in the song but what the heck in this crappy movie she got hit by the sleigh it's like what the heck why why when my kids heard the they thought it was good but we they watched this they were like this daddy why did granny thats how my kids say grandma any way my kids said this daddy why did grandma get hit by a sleigh i told them that the movie was crappy they agreed it's sad why would any one name there dog that's just dumb when every one dressed in black that looked so so i mean daphne looked like a dang emo goth girl every one looked like in the song they found grandma on the ground i think she died in the song but in this weird crappy movie she was gone i think they should take this show off ok every one would love this i give this a 1 out of 10
<START> i have been a fan of amanda's since all that and she is still funny too me it's as simple as that if you like the bynes you will like this film it's harmless fun and quite funny in parts wacky sebastian accent and mannerisms are entirely unrealistic but made me laugh so hard at some points i almost choked on my popcorn br br and anything that gets teens reading shakespeare maybe is a good thing for me br br on a shallow note tatum channing is quite ahem freaking hot he also does a good job with some of the film's tougher scenes br br some of the side characters are very broad but they are broad in twelfth night so it's cool
<START> this movie is well made it is beautiful and wise it is heart warming it is great and again it shows how great peter falk is he is fantastic and he even gets better the older he gets thank you peter falk thank you very much for this gem of a movie br br this movie entertains there is lot of wisdom in this movie there is lot of humor in this movie there is life in this movie and meaning this movie shows how life can be br br peter falk is in that movie he is just great where is the oscar for peter falk he deserves it so very much br br peter falk just turned 80 i do sincerely hope that there will be more movies br br walter j
<START> being in the suburbs of new york when the z boys were creating history in dogtown i was only exposed to a glimpse of what was going on i had a p o s black knight skateboard with clay wheels it is long gone and on the ash heap of my personal life but i never forgot it's like watching long lost brothers and friends and it hits me right where i live i cannot watch this film enough every time i view it some other aspect rises to the top some other viewpoint come into sharp focus the vintage footage the incredible stills the current personalities with the vivid shadows of the brightly lit past the heartfelt and not over done narrative all beautifully edited together in such a way as to make a landmark documentary of a genuine slice of american history in the words of glen friedman it was f ing unbelievable
<START> saw this as part of the dc reel affirmations film festival i hope they got better movies than this because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained from the fantasy of seeing james franco without his shirt down to more simple wishes such as decent acting coherent direction character development or actual production values plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress and obvious influences ranging from my own private idaho to terminator 2 this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience after the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously the audience collectively threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film i could be upset that i paid nine bucks to see it and it was two hours i'll never get back but on the other hand it was an entertaining two hours i'll never get back this would have been a classic mystery science 3000 episode
<START> i saw the movie in as the closing film of film festival i didn't know anything about it but right now i'm glad i didn't refuse the chance to see ding a ling less it is one of the funniest movies i've ever watched and believe me i've seen zillions of movies i'm a film critic clever script and dialogs smart details what else can i say an indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor one can't stop by wonder what he's capable of right now ding a ling less was shot five years ago and i'm sure the director is more mature now i heard that his next feature will be a political satire and i really can't wait to see that too among with his previous works like house of pancakes
<START> yes it's sean connery playing bond again looking more alive and into his part than any time since the first time they made this film in 1965 when it was called thunderball but the tongue is so firmly in cheek one wonders if connery isn't employing a few observed tricks from his friend and more humorous successor roger moore br br moore is my favorite bond but connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual outing the only serious bond film not made under the of the classic eon bond series never say never again is an irreverent return to the well soft on action it's nevertheless strong on character and clever dialogue br br bond it's made clear right away is a man in no matter how many times he has saved the world his new boss thinks little of his fat lifestyle too many free radicals that's your problem caused by eating too much red meat white bread too many martinis then i shall cut out the white bread sir bond smartly replies br br an early fight sequence in a spa represents the movie's high point action wise with bond and an attacker fighting their way through a kitchen a bedroom and a laboratory before bond finally douses his opponent ironically with no small help from those free radicals humor is liberally applied in the film rather more cleverly than most of moore's outings though connery seems to be having more fun sending himself up as a result of moore's less egotistic example br br was it because he was making a good chunk of the gross or was it working for less stingy producers whatever it is the screenplay serves his laid back style well and the result is richer and more entertaining than connery's prior two eon bond outings you only live twice and diamonds are forever br br the 1980s were not a good decade for bond whether it was connery moore or timothy dalton leg warmers video games and ugly sports cars are all in evidence and the bianca jagger sunglasses klaus maria brandauer is seen wearing in his first scene do him no favors forget first impressions brandauer's role as the chief villain maximilian largo is one of the best in any bond film with brandauer enjoyably playing up his character's menace and mania at one point he allows bond free roam of his situation room with a martini to boot and his dancing eyes and mad engaging grin make for compelling company throughout br br the best thing in this film other than connery are the bond girls shot with more attention to personality than normal in bond films a testament to cinematographer douglas and director irvin kirshner barbara carrera was nominated for a golden globe for her role as the villainess blush every bit as crazy as largo and even nicer to look at she doesn't last the whole movie you almost need her gone in order to focus on the others br br kim basinger's breasts and buttocks should have had their own agents for the screen time they get in this film but i'm not complaining basinger's a rare beauty who in this early role as largo's mistress mixes incredible with a childlike vulnerability that brings out the bond in me and many others i suspect her lips and cheekbones are pretty sweet too br br it's not a well constructed film it's a knockoff of a better bond movie with a sloppy storyline a terrible score and a flat ending but it does have connery proving his was the definitive take on cinema's definitive secret agent even if he steals a page or two from my 007 mr moore the end result is entertaining enough so i'm not complaining
<START> this 1 hour 30 minute inside joke is best understood by catholics the number one religion of self medicating comedians the world over that isn't to say it can't stand on its own which it does that the film isn't without its flaws which its got technical issues mostly belief that in 1998 digital was the answer when in fact it was in its infancy a beta of a beta if you will and re mastering will never improve it for the love of god hal please get yourself a red one or three br br if you like hartley films of course you'll like it i liked it because i liked grim fool and there were added benefits of retrospect i couldn't help noticing a disturbing self prophecy an airliner soaring overhead used as a harbinger of armageddon in this 1998 movie it was as if cheney had gotten the whole idea from hal it's true hartley moves his players round into the camera like it's the house of just one piece of the gimmickry that needs a rest after all we're already paying attention to the actors and the writing is alive not great writing but fervent can i use the word fervent purposeful intelligent not condescending br br absolutely love pj harvey in this course i'd love her anywhere oddly if helen mirren needs a younger self she should look harvey up and bring a bottle of blond
<START> simply awful i'm including a spoiler warning here only because of including a jokes from the movie there is nothing else to spoil as it is already rotten this dross was made during what must have been one of sellers' for a few dollars more periods when he'd participate in any crap for a few bucks i'd seen this as a 15 year old high school student in 1972 and loathed it then no need to view it again after 35 years i remember it now as one of the top five worst movies i'd seen as a kid as i recall sellers had more of an ongoing cameo role than a lead here but even his presence couldn't the stale jokes lame plot and infantile repartee one ongoing theme revolves around sellers' use of his fingers in one scene he holds up his open hand to a group of medicos and by folding down his fingers enumerates the groups for which a hospital exists the interns the nurses the administrators etc until only his middle finger is left up whereupon he says and the patients har har in another scene to avoid costly lab tests he dips a finger into a urine sample and sticks it into his mouth to check for sugar then the interns gathered around him to do the same which they do he then advises them that he'd placed his middle finger in the urine but sucked on the index finger and admonishes them to pay attention hee hee the only reason that i remember this and this movie and am writing this review is that a friend told me an even dumber version of this 'joke' today if yu you gonna luv dis if not see with george c scott came out the same year 1972 for some genuine marvelous black medical humor better yet read 'the house of god' by samuel and if you can see the movie version of it which has never been released please make a copy and send it to me i'd love to finally see it
<START> ok so i loved rachael ray before but now i adore her how innovative i love that she has a cooking section i admit that occasionally i skip that part only because it makes me waaay too hungry but i also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website i love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars i love how personable she is and how creative she is i also like how she does her mystery guests she just seems so much more genuine than so many other talk show hosts she still gets a little starstruck occasionally and i love that i love that she talks about her personal life on there and reminds people how happy she is she's even mentioned tabloids before and it's so funny she also has the funniest stories anyway i'm a fan for life even my 2 year old knows who rachael ray is and he loves her too
<START> mr bean was great fun i loved it every episode was really funny rowan atkinson was perfect for this role he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious br br the series was so successful that they even made a mr bean movie in 1997 which was also pretty funny by the way br br it's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into this series was a classic for sure and i still watch an episode from time to time br br mr bean is well worth a 10 10 in my book fans of offbeat comedy must check this out
