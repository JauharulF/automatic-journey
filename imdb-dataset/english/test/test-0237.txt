<START> rendered in beautiful water colors at the cliff is definitely a sight to behold vaguely remembering the trailer witch i didn't find that impressive i was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was this film just washed over me with its purity br br at the center is a young boy that comes into contact with a sea creature and its their relationship that carries the movie miyazaki is a master both at creating memorable imagery and showing young ones interacting in a believable way with their little quirks intact br br there are a few parts that didn't sit well with me it would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene resembled ride of the its a shame because such a precious film as this cant afford to take liberties and it hurt a otherwise truly great scene the antagonist and its back story never interested me either but i guess it served more as a background then anything else br br anyway great film the boat trip scenario with all its imagery and sea creatures stood out me thinks pure and magical and yes artwork is more intimate then computer animated i'm really pumped for princes and the frog now
<START> on humphrey bogart's first trip to hollywood he got his first leading man role in this b picture love affair the first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with charles boyer and irene dunne or the two remakes that followed it's not half as good any of those films br br in fact bogey is second billed to dorothy as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser hale hamilton it comes as quite a shock to she considers a show business career as a way for an income br br bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors is willing to do it besides she likes what she sees in bogey br br considering the cynical roles that bogart later made a specialty it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in love affair the part doesn't wear well on him br br love affair is your average b program second feature nothing terribly special about it
<START> the dvd sleeve explains the premise three problem teens are headed for jail and are set to do time until captain greer offers them a deal to work for him undercover the film opens with definitions of the words mod and squad so you won't have to look them up in the dictionary for a visual definition of cool search for photographs of the original threesome michael cole as pete cochran clarence williams iii as hayes and peggy lipton as julie barnes br br one black one white one blonde once they defined cool br br the three who make up scott silver's version of aaron spelling's the mod squad are claire danes as julie barnes giovanni ribisi as pete cochran and omar epps as hayes they aren't able to do much with the material given mr ribisi's portrayal is the most far out meaning he most from the original characterization ms danes romances josh brolin as billy waites who looks like he could be in a re make of marcus md you won't believe hefty michael lerner dancing with mr he explains i'm not a fairy i just like to dance and requests spin me br br the mod squad 1999 scott silver claire danes giovanni ribisi omar epps
<START> tep is like a long cool drink of water after crawling across the sahara to classic film buffs who have been too long deprived of that certain cinematic magic not only is it beautifully photographed but the characters are perfectly portrayed if you're looking for the film to be a mirror of the book you will be seriously disappointed instead it is an excellent companion to the book and i think that is what anthony intended ralph fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world not to mention a brilliant actor juliette binoche is the posterchild for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm and of course i'll go see any film in which kristin scott thomas is featured she simply must be the best actress since the likes of deborah kerr so much was promised with this film and so much is delivered
<START> when does the hurting stop that's what i said somewhere between the beginning and that other part of the movie that really sucked this film nearly sapped all the life out of me and i have sat through some really bad movies coming from a true puppet master fan i would expect to hear myself say this but it's true the plot is inane the special effects awful the sound track the most infernal i have ever heard oh i almost forgot about the acting it was so bad that i forgot it was there at all nuff said the only redeeming factor in the film is the puppets themselves they truly are the stars and could out act all but guy rolfe himself he is the puppetmaster and although you can see their wires and strings they carry me throughout the painful start to finish of retro puppet master in closing is for true fanatics who happen to be masochists br br roach br br
<START> i absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained the directing acting and the story is brilliant definitely up there with films like scarface and the godfather this movie makes your heart race damian as well as all of the cast was amazing i would definitely rent this movie damian deserves an academy award for his acting and for the way he portrayed the life of a gangster this movie is a soon to be classic and an all around brilliant piece of film making i loved it and i give it 10 stars in a sentence the only way to describe it is a film without any flaws watch this movie and you'll see what i mean 2 thumbs up
<START> for their credit this is one of their more competent pieces of trash and that's because there's considerably good gore and an interesting take on ripping off snakes on a plane but if there's any more of example of the inconsistency behind newest rip off it's the two characters at the beginning whom are illegal immigrants and can't understand nor speak english to a texas man sneaking them across the border yet when they get on a train and meet a friend they begin understanding and speaking perfect english br br aside from being a pretty bad depiction of a hollywood formula snakes on a train is utterly boring at least with snakes on a plane we were given the chance to watch actors wax comedic and attempt to be remotely interesting the brothers installment features some of the most boring characters i've ever seen from an electrical engineer gee i wonder how he comes in handy later on to some stoner surfers right down to our two main characters attempting to fight off the snake curse that lurks in the husband's wife br br snakes is never entertaining and even when it's very gory it's still never as good as it has the chance to be because snakes could have been a funny short film and instead just takes itself much too seriously and never camps it up at any moment instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent they instead force their small budget to work against them in these knock offs while the brothers seem to be trying the train just looks incredibly artificial br br it seems almost like a stage play with these inconsistent and awfully bland set pieces that try desperately to look like actual train cars while every so often it shakes the background of the windows are blurred and the sound effects go off every now and then to let us know they're actually on a train not to mention that in such a large extended train there only seems to be about ten passengers on it and beyond the train fight and a drawn out sex scene we're forced to be subjected to a plot that makes zero sense and not even the directors can work around the fact that the lethal snakes that go on this train look far from venomous or dangerous br br the rest of the film staggers onto only about a minute of snake carnage and a bad subplot of an ex drug agent trying to molest a passenger all of this dull exposition ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a poorly computer generated snake i saw better animation on the super nintendo completely swallows the train whole and is then dispensed in a method that should have been exercised from the very beginning asylum scores again br br asylum scores yet again with a hackneyed lazy horribly directed and boring rip off of another better film snakes on a train takes itself way too seriously and that's why it's never entertaining or memorable
<START> yes it's pure trash it might be interesting for every guy who likes experimental cinema like me to see lowlifes babbling and doing nothing for almost two hours but it gets very painful when you realize you have actually paid for this probably this is one of those films you love to watch for its complete emptiness and nihilism i accept it though for its shock value decades before trainspotting and pulp fiction
<START> i have no respect for imdb ratings anymore i think a bunch of mormons flooded the website and voted for this this is not an artistic movie it is mormon propaganda nothing wrong with that but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading if you are a bible thumping christian or a mormon watch this movie you'll love it and think it is truly amazing for anyone else don't bother the story is so contrived random stuff happens that really doesn't follow in a coherent way this guy tries to commit suicide cause he sleeps with his neighbor are you kidding what a pussy anyways this is an awful movie
<START> the man gaston modot and the young girl go through the film consumed by passion for each other they long to be together but their moments together are constantly interrupted the film is strewn together with imagery and comes to a halt after an hour do the lovers find happiness br br the film starts interestingly with footage of scorpions but you soon realize that its all a pretentious piece of nonsense it's made as a silent film with occasional dialogue and it has a non stop soundtrack playing that at one point is so irritating that you will turn the sound down and want to watch it as a silent film the continuous drum rolls must have driven cinema audiences mad there are some genuinely funny moments eg when the man kicks a dog and when he knocks over a blind man unfortunately this humour is carried out in the name of art so its just pseudo nonsense the film is crap
<START> this was a character's movie the plot wasn't that hot when it was there but the characters were interesting and very well acted the story focuses on the travis family in the wake of the eldest son's suicide i say that loosely because the story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother because if the father was supposed to have the story focus on him too they edited the movie pretty poorly the acting on all parts was very good particularly emile hirsch as the surviving confused son the characters were all very interesting and i didn't mind watching them until late in the film when it just seemed to drag br br my big complaint however was the story the son killing himself was supposed to be the center of the plot however it really wasn't it was something that happened at the start of the story but then everything went every which way then they'd mention that the son killed himself to remind you that that was the central thread the other thing was that the big plot twists of which there were plenty were never really explained or built up to but just thrown in there randomly and often from far left field in fairness the ending was very very cool but it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from about half of it the half that wasn't padding was pretty much lifted from the story in the pearl jam song alive which reminds me br br there was a poem in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who killed themself i could not have been the only one who recognized that said poem was lifted word for word from that very same song i dunno this was a movie i had hope for and they really really dropped the ball
<START> this is an ok early 80's horror flick in which a young girl meg tilly is wanting to shed her goody two shoes image and becomes part of a girl gang called the sisters their initiation for her consists of spending the night in a mausoleum too bad the mausoleum is the final resting place of some psycho russian psychic and he's not quite dead yet seems this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck into the walls from his telekinetic target practice plus there is a pile of young dead girls found in the closet all proof that hitch hiking can be dangerous so listen up girls the daughter of this man is rather distraught about her father's death and is confronted by a man that said he knew and given a tape to listen too her hubby adam west of batman fame is there to laugh and scoff and not much else but it seems that perhaps daughter may also have some abilities that she doesn't realize anyway having deposited their unfortunate pledge at the mausoleum the rest of the sisters take off to go get stuff like masks sheets etc to come back and scare the crap out of her but little do they suspect what's going on and they get more than the crap scared out of them for even in death is kind of a busy guy and he's reanimating lots of corpses for entertainment and it would also seem that he has a thing for jail bait overall this is acceptable horror nothing too intense but not terrible either the dvd from media blasters also contains another version of the movie that's a rough cut i guess i only watched a little of it so i don't know how different it is from the theatrical release but from what i saw i guess it's a warts and all presentation 7 out of 10
<START> i really didn't see this one coming roy had me pegged out i am the perfect sucker for a static camera long live king borowczyk and i was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film he hit me straight between the eyes you have to be a brilliant man to make self pity hilarious reminds me of the third mate on the pequod in moby dick flask a man who took the whole of life to be a practical joke that the good lord himself is playing on us and the web of egotism in this movie is truly hilarious br br the level of satire is at fever pitch you have one deluded self pitying dreamer harp on about the cruelty of the world and then totally ignore a spiritual self reflection crying out in agony the very depths of egotism are plumbed i really never thought it possible to go further than bergman's the silence in this respect however the of the self love and self regard by every single character in this film is staggering we are shown an existence where the talentless and the idle rail against a world they believe has been unjust towards them they truly are legends in their own living rooms the human beings in this film make self deception and self delusion a great br br only one woman in the film appears to have any sort of understanding of what is going on an old woman who refuses to leave a chapel down praying for the forgiveness of all mankind her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world i have ever heard she reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world is not to be fixed by mere tinkering there are not a just a few faults there is an abyss of corruption that can only be mended by and judgement day watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk stood waist deep in a cold river at midnight screaming out a thousand for the sins of humanity another grand is that it is clear that her prayers are futile and in fact she is stopping everyone going home at closing time br br this is not a film for the smug no one is spared no idols are left on the altar no one group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group never has there been a greater more transcendent more astonishingly beautiful summation of our sins it is a film for the end of the world it is the grand jest the great hideous practical joke of human life br br from the catalogue of images it is too difficult to pick a favourite i slapped my thigh and almost fell off my chair in the cinema screaming with laughter as a man attempted to pull the tablecloth from under a set service i won't spoil what happens but the suspense builds up and something truly unexpected occurs it is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen in a cinema i am quite reserved and i just couldn't control myself that is the measure of the greatness of this film br br the shooting of you the living is impeccably formalist we are shown the palette of an artist dingy browns yellows greys and sky blues set alive by the shock of luminous brass textures there is never a tone out of place it's like an hour and a half of symphonic colour meld the obsession that must have gone into putting that colour scheme in place is extraordinary and no shot is wasted as with all great movies there is not a spare inch of celluloid br br perhaps the best film i've ever seen
<START> this is a very good movie i give it a 10 br br it's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through the fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way br br she sees a murder for a snuff movie and decides to run but is chased this takes quite some time i won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience but rest assured it's very believable well played very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending br br don't miss this movie
<START> is the cannes controversy meter remarkably esoteric or is that we americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore be that as it may with plenty of careful analyzing at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to cannes in 2005 a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it's glum american re title low profile br br building on familiar themes of bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation kind of admittedly it's a film not without it's surface level interests it starts out with a grabber as a haunting shot of a desolate off the highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter who ultimately walks by a car where supposedly a brutal hit and run has left the driver dead in a gory mess stunned he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine br br just out of school the drifter turns out to be armin a product of the german suburbs with minimal ambition pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it every one with the same fruitless outcome getting mighty sick of it his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit br br pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown as the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he's doing nothing out of the ordinary br br if you seem confused about what exactly is going on don't worry about being the only one this is about as far and coherent as the story gets the plot seems simple enough and perhaps due to it's seemingly direct purposes that's why becomes pointlessly convoluted becoming enamored with endless false conclusions dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument supposedly the soul numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland or something about youth's fascination with crime hey it could even be a coming out movie at hand it spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols both tangible and allegorical but they don't seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest br br the most fatal flaw however is how the filmmakers paint all it's characters in a rough shade of vanilla there's hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose and how the secondary characters especially the confused relationship between armin and his rather normal perhaps too normal family the already under developed lead character's plight never comes into focus how are we supposed to identify with this young almost rebellion with little sense of the world he's living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it br br many people drop in and out of the movie including sort of girlfriend katja and a strange affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever they ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next br br and even a movie that supposedly toys with reality especially with nightly exploits it ends with a literal almost moralizing head scratcher that seems to halt questions to a story that does little but put it's viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted br br without any color it's impossible to shade anything vital in
