<START> an in name only sequel to john carpenter's vampires this movie takes place in thailand and involves a sect of bad vampires who enjoy killing people and a sect of good vampires who do not while it's an interesting idea to set a vampire film in thailand the writers don't seem to do a lot with the exotic locale this film could just as easily have been set in los angeles which brings me to my next point which is that this seems a lot like blade lite we've got the rock soundtrack the martial art battle scenes a dance club bloodletting and of course lots of sharp objects going through vampires what we don't have is the budget and talent yes the hero is a good martial arts fighter too bad his acting wasn't as good and there's plenty of decent wire work and tons of revved up fight sequences maybe too many the problem is they just don't have the same impact as the ones in any of the blade films perhaps it's just that the film has a been there seen that feel to it br br however for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between the lead played by the buff and bland colin and his girlfriend she gets snatched at the very beginning of the flick after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend we have no vested interest in her welfare at this point and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her now that's a major drawback when that's the major thrust of the plot br br in the end you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time with this but i can think of a lot better things to do with your time like renting any of the blade movies
<START> just saw baby blue marine again after 30 years i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever the innocence and purity of a time now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film the acting is above average and richard gere's brief appearance as a shell shocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan jan micheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the all american boy the late bruno kirby who was billed as b kirby jr has a meaty role as pop a peace loving marine corp reject dreaming of getting back home to his wife if you're looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you if you're looking for action and adventure the same applies however if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a movie for you
<START> adult version of the classic lewis carroll tale is much better than you might expect here alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs its an naughty little tale for adults if you're wondering whether or not my recommendation is a good one or not consider that the film was pretty much only available in its non hardcore version for the better part of the last three decades simply because the film stands up with out the sex which is how i first saw the film years ago on cable tv the relatively recent home video release on dvd put back the sex in horribly grainy inserted clips which makes it clear the removal of the shots was the best choice all around if you're an open minded adult with a taste for something spicy i can heartily recommend this little film as a nice diversion
<START> i recently had to watch this for a project in a sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie i have ever had to sit through it was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the good bits taken out bad acting the fake documentary set up nonsensical plot and rudderless direction all combine to make a terrible terrible film br br the female characters are basically only there to be sex objects consider this exchange he's hot he has a girlfriend do you have a girlfriend no girl takes boys hand and leads him behind some bushes boy comes out and sits next to other boy girl off did you hit that no i didn't want to take my pants off you're stupid another girl shows up when the boys are going to beverly hills gets in the trunk with one of the boys and when they get pulled over by a cop you see the car bobbing up and down br br a homosexual pervert a trigger happy clint eastwood look alike and what seems to be a mask all add to the inanity one of the boys gets caught by a cop no one cares one of the boys gets shot no one cares br br someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised and it shows just awful i would never recommend this film to anyone
<START> my friends and i have watched this so many time i have lost count this is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects this film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with br br you'll laugh as greg leaps and shuffles around the lab petting his pet rabbit while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back greg stop clowning scolds dr brandon you'll laugh as j g patterson gives hand signals to direct greg to the other side of the operating table while his hand is in the shot and you'll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman has none of the features he used to construct her with
<START> what a horrible movie this movie was so out of order and so hard to follow it was so hard to follow and was just confusing the whole time i was watching it i was wishing it would end i felt like i wasted 2hours of my life that i will never get back save your money and don't rent this movie i now see why sarah michelle gellar was barely in the movie the first movie was great but this was just sucked i would never recommend this movie to anyone save your money and watch the trailer because that is about the only thing that is worth seeing with this movie this movie had no real story to it either i am still wondering what i watched
<START> i felt compelled to comment on this film because it's listed as the fourth lowest rated sci film of all time on the imdb what sure this movie is crappy but it's hilarious it's not awful on an ed wood level it's more surreal and uneven br br there are some classic moments in the film the brain surgery is gross and great and even nuttier when you consider that the film was rated pg gor chasing after his dolly before getting battery acid dumped on his face mine speeches at the beginning of the film before amir kali was but another weak nation struggling to break free from centuries of stagnant angelo also has some great lines no gor no you want these keys don't you my it is absolutely wrong that this is the 4th lowest rated sci film on the imdb because it is entertaining no matter how bad a film is if it still manages to be weird quirky unsettling or entertaining it has merit and doesn't deserve to be dumped on and dismissed i won't defend most of al adamson's films but this one along with dracula vs frankenstein and blood of ghastly horror are entertaining enough to make up for their awfulness
<START> this is my first awful rating ever on imdb and i couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with i hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest dullest kind i found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about including its creator br br hell ride directed written by and starring larry friend of qt bishop has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story focusing instead of putting his swaying strangely grimacing main character into situations where he can fondle women who pretend to like it he also has a dialog containing enough horrible fire puns metaphors to put one off the word fire for life br br dennis hopper escapes complete humiliation others are not so lucky sometimes they hit the road on their bikes making one feel even more sorry for michael madsen since his high handles seems to add insult to the injury of having to appear in this film there is plenty of silicon enhanced nudity but fairly little action and no humor whatsoever making one wonder just what kind of an audience they had in mind br br my guess is that most people who watch this film including fans of trashy 60s biker movies will feel cheated do yourself a favor and revisit the real stuff instead
<START> the hero john is going after some drug dealers who kidnaps girls for some reason on his journey he uses karate and kung fu moves and i don't believe he got hit a single time during the movie this is crap
<START> honestly i didn't really have high expectations for this movie but at the same time i was hopeful having it be directing by albert pyun one of the more well known b movie auteur's didn't exactly raise my hopes i mean how many albert pyun flicks rank that highly yeah exactly but still the movie advertised a decent cast rob lowe burt reynolds pre reborn stardom ice t and mario van peebles br br it all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on it runs over 90 minutes but it's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat i don't know what pyun was going for here i mean the movie drips artsy like style but it's a blur at times and maybe i'm an idiot for expecting more from pyun this time around here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material but it's all wasted crazy six isn't much of an action film it's not much of anything really br br i guess what's the saddest here is the fact that i found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie the music score is actually half decent with some smooth female vocals too but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better avoid
<START> for all that has been said about the subject matter and the controversy that surrounded it please do not overlook what i feel to be the most important part of the film the salient struggles of everyone to keep their pride through their trials whether dealing with self imposed male braggadocio a sexual reawakening or even life itself everybody is human
<START> this movie has no plot it was supposed to be that a guy moves in with his grandma and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself but what happens after everyone finds out who he's living with they have a big pot party at grandma's house the climax of the movie didn't even relate to the rest of it that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie's end i can see how it could have related to the supposed story that grandma's vg skills redeem him but that just wasn't there br br however the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes br br her pussy smells like the great depression he just sucked his first titty yeah for 13 hours it's for you i think it's the devil
<START> awkward disaster mishmash has a team of scavengers coming across the overturned s s poseidon hoping to loot it before it goes under for good irwin allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster the poseidon adventure arrived in theaters seven years later never mind that nobody cared anymore why give us such a shoddy production filled with dim characters and miscast actors only to trash the memory of your biggest hit one might end up feeling really sorry for michael caine sally field peter boyle jack warden karl malden and shirley jones were it not for their lost at sea expressions good for a few stray laughs there's a moment when saintly jones is tempted into taking some treasures just for herself and she timidly starts stuffing her pockets that is an unintended hoot the film was a career for all concerned most especially allen who never quite recovered from this from
<START> duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler edgar with his eyes on a big inheritance decides to dope them and get them out of the picture how can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of paris only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat a rough diamond with romance in his heart after they get a taste of the wide dangerous world he guides them home and edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse as always it's really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the disney magic phil harris is brilliant as eva gabor as duchess is well eva gabor but perhaps the most memorable turns are by pat and george lindsay who turn the old hounds napoleon and lafayette into a couple of bumbling southern fried rednecks their scenes with edgar and the musical numbers with scat cat and his cool dude band are classic most striking about seeing the aristocats now is how deeply disney's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970 perhaps the nostalgic dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in belle epoque paris but the illustrations are a pity and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic sometimes a relief than in more recent efforts such as aladdin
<START> i cannot believe i actually sat through the whole of this movie it was absolutely awful and totally cringe worthy and yet i sat through it thinking it had to get better it didn't and i have wasted 2 hours of my life will smith is much better in action movies i loved him in i robot enemy of the state and independence day and i don't think he can really be expected to carry off an entire movie as the romantic lead in the way that cary grant could then again the script was unbearably awful and the dialogue was so cheesy br br i disliked everyone except for albert's character and even that i found was done with a heavy hand if you want to watch a modern feel good romantic comedy watch something like how to lose a guy in ten days or when harry met sally the 40 year old virgin left me with a smile on my face i even preferred music and lyrics above this and yes i know it's cheesy but at least it didn't take itself seriously and was sweet i also disliked the main female lead and wasn't convinced of the chemistry between her and will smith's character br br in all i think there were two scenes that i liked and definitely not the ending which was nauseating and unconvincing hitch calling sarah when she hadn't given him her number was quite sweet and no sorry that's the only thing i liked about the entire film don't waste your time
