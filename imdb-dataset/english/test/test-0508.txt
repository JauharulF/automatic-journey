<START> tromeo juliet 10th anniversary edition br br william shakespeare's play romeo juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films sometimes literally following the original text which is at times vague in stage directions sometimes in new interpretations where directors chose to show their own view on the piece some are good many are mediocre lloyd kaufman's film certainly stands out as one of the most original modern versions of the bard's creation it may be placed in a modern day decaying new york and full of the modern day anti social behavior body piercing dismemberment and kinky sex which for the more than casual reader shakespeare himself wasn't shying away from but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about which is quite an effort kaufman wrote the script with his co director on the film james gunn who is now famous for writing two successful scooby doo movies doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for dawn of the dead and directing one of the best horror films of the year slither lloyd innovative directorial view alongside with james gunns original and unrestricted writing make for an interpretation of shakespeare's play that maybe not everyone will get immediately but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important view on a classic play with a script that is written entirely in iambic meter appearances of and an outrageous forceful soundtrack watching tromeo juliet is something no one will ever forget apart from it's historical significance tromeo juliet is a treasure for film lovers of all kind not only for the script by james gunn now a good influence on hollywood while working from the inside but also because it features an early part of legendary actress debbie rochon well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets the 10th anniversary edition on dvd adds to all that by including so many as yet undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the dvd but also a very honest and disturbing look is given into the ways independent cinema has to surviver these days in many ways the extra's on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given on kaufman's film school make your own damn movie historical items from the troma vaults which include james gunn debbie rochon and all other contributors to this masterpiece are included and the film itself is apart from looking better then ever accompanied by no less than four audio commentaries each and everyone informative excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical commentaries that are so common these days there are new commentaries one with kaufman and gunn together but also the one james gunn did for the original release of the dvd but couldn't be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc with fan recreations of a few of the scenes from the film a video diary of lloyd kaufman's visit to the set of james gunn's slither and a visit the two brought together to eli roth's hostel birthday party and much more this is the ultimate set everyone must own weather you are a film historian someone interested in interpretations of the great bard's work a fan of great cinema a fighter for independent cinema a fan of james gunn interested in learning more on making films on a low budget a fan of lloyd kaufman or whatever this is the most important dvd release of this millennium
<START> as a fan of robocop i always loved this movie i seen it when it first came out and finally i bought it on dvd from brazil it was never released in the us on dvd i like the film but like everything else in this world everyone has their opinion love it or hate it no matter what a movie does someone will always say why didn't they do it another way in other words you cant please everyone if you love robocop you will love this film to me its so unique thats its not cheesy or silly like a lot of lower budget movies this film always kept me interested i can see a few scenes that robocop borrowed from here but tell me what movies don't do that a lot of films use other ideas from other movies and sometimes change them around fun film
<START> s l o w l o n g d u l l br br oh my god dull br br characters so annoying you'll cringe every time you see or the guy that played from now on they must have never rehearsed or reviewed the film in progress mel gibson was absolutely wooden br br this may not be the worst movie ever made but that it went almost straight to video says it is darn close br br
<START> i say ben johnson and my fellow canadians say ben johnson he was a goddam movie star guys a cowboy and by 1976 he was scraping by playing a sheriff in stupid made for tv disaster movies such as this cashing in on the deadly swarms of killer bees that everyone apparently thought were coming to get us at the time so there's these bees and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and going after them underwater eventually these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire swarm the cops are like what do we do uh bees die when it's cold so where could we make it cold i know the stadium in new orleans so they drive this car and its attendant swarm of killer bees on and on through the streets of new orleans with a bullhorn saying get off the streets or you will be stung to death and the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with its broken toilets so becomes the narcotic doom of this particular bees i don't know which is the greater indignity on this great city well i do but this one sucks too most appropriately viewed on an extremely faded to orange 16mm print although betamax is a good alternative
<START> this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years if there was ever a movie that needed word of mouth to promote this is it a 4 mil box is a disgrace people don't know what it's about if you have any appreciation for the blues or just a good use of excellent music that alone is reason to go see it how many people knew jackson could sing and damn fine too you hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation after seeing this you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word yes it's gritty sexy down home truth bizarre and in your face real isn't that the best reason to see a movie those that get my meaning won't stay away from seeing this another week
<START> when i first saw the premiere episode of farscape i had no idea what to expect i was immensely impressed and satisfied with premiere subsequent re watches however have made numerous flaws apparent to me that i missed initially premiere is not a great farscape episode but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters br br the episode begins with john crichton ben browder an astronaut and scientist preparing to launch into space in the farscape module a small space ship perfected by crichton and his friend dk crichton has a revealing conversation with his father jack crichton and then begins his test flight in space of course everything goes wrong and crichton is shot through a wormhole and winds up in a distant part of the galaxy br br after exiting the wormhole crichton's module is pulled on board a living space ship from here the characters and story line for the farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner br br the regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode of course there is crichton played well by ben browder he offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with he's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything in premiere crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the peacekeepers he knows nothing at all about either side but in helping a captured pilot it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers he probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for a captain declaring crichton to be the murderer of his brother this puts crichton in an interesting situation he's stuck with bizarre violent escaped prisoners in a far off galaxy about which he knows nothing at all crichton's total lack of knowledge of the world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during first season br br the supporting cast is just as compelling there's a blue and former prisoner she's peaceful and reasonable as opposed to fellow prisoner ka a powerful and hard headed warrior virginia hey is totally covered in blue makeup allowing her character of to appear cool and convincing mega makeup in contrast is below par he looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose and there is something peculiar about his eyes they look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in season 1 but the overall costume would for me at least remain as a problem until season 2 br br the puppet digital characters of and pilot are to put it simply excellent is a tiny who floats around on some sort of in premiere he is given some good dialogue but not much else pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship and passengers even in the first episode pilot gives off the appearance of being a real living alien he never once in the show seems to be a giant expensive machine br br the characters introduced are quite interesting as well the peacekeepers are made up of a race called who look just like humans the chief antagonist is introduced in premiere as captian who believes that crichton killed his brother in reality brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with crichton's ship sun a pilot who crichton helps escape tries to explain that the death was an accident but just claims that she is contaminated and refused to change his mind obsession for revenge warranted or not it should be clear to that crichton isn't responsible is mysterious in premiere but would be explained later in the season herself provides an extremely interesting character by being forced to leave the peacekeepers she changes her whole way of life and is in that regard in a similar though less severe situation as crichton br br the actual episode as mentioned earlier feels somewhat rushed and clunky so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything also for now looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing still premiere is solid entertainment the special effects such as in the sequences are impressive most of the costumes and the sets on board are original despite its flaws premiere is a must see for farscape fans 3 4
<START> i admit to being in awe of the sea and have spent a number of years in the navy so i am somewhat biased on this one i missed this documentary when it first came out but various people to buy me it on dvd this christmas 2002 and i got it some of the film is amazing and i have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries to see 200 ton blue whales through the sea is an incredible sight they looked like submarines i like the level of information and facts conveyed through the narration it is just right i don't want to know a load of science just some of the basics to see these things is enough for most people the bbc has a knack of putting things at the right level for the intended audience br br a really great documentary up there with 'the world at war for' me the dvd is of excellent quality if i had a minor criticism it would be some of the obviously added sound effects here and there i think they detract from some of the scenes but well done to the bbc and discovery
<START> well i thought the movie was blah 1 10 br br anyways the best part is the first 5 minutes of the film with the nerd's or whatever girlfriend this is the part u guys watch out for tho she had big hooters i thought is that really a random actor heck no it wasn't it was actually a model by the name of larissa but u already knew that br br so that made sense but that was about it rest of the film that i saw anyway didn't care 4 and didn't bother watching the rest of it that's br br all i needed to c to be satisfied so 2 those of u that just care for that well there u go enjoy
<START> i was disappointed with the sequel to the swan princess i can see what they were trying to do with the story show how married life was going for odette and derek but the story wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the original br br it isn't funny the only bit i found humorous was when jean bob was turned into a prince and then back into a frog and no one saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that it really did br br the villain is rubbish and the animation isn't as impressive as the first film br br the queen is a very irritating character and instead of cheering with derek to rescue his mother you're hoping that the villain puts a spell on her voice box to stop her talking br br it is a shame because i really liked the first movie but it didn't live up to my expectations
<START> it has been a long time since i have been to a movie as lame and boring as this one it is one thing to have a slow pace where characters are being developed in a progressive way or some aspect of the movie clearly is enhanced by such pacing such as 'lost in translation however there is a difference between slow progression and outright stalling as happened in this one i guess from the look on helen mirren's face she must have been distraught by the disappearance of her husband surprise surprise what a marvelously creative moment the meeting of the mistress and wife was sarcasm and what a great way that the whole story fell apart at the end truly a masterpiece
<START> we found this movie nearly impossible to watch with such a super cast it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful the excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening the flash backs were clumsy the characters were one dimensional the heavy handed metaphors the river the cat were repeated way too often br br the movie nobody's fool based on another novel by russo was infinitely better probably because it was more tightly written and directed br br the photography in empire falls was lovely too bad it wasn't a travelogue br br i read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself i would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novel's reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie this was supposed to be a television movie guys not books on tape
<START> the eighties produced a lot of gory little horror flicks most of them within the slasher sub genre thus putting this film ahead of most of the rest of its ilk night of the demons is something of a cross between the ultimate gore film the evil dead and haunted house cum slash flick hell night films like this usually feature a deranged deformed madman as the lead bad guy but here we have bloodthirsty demons which is always more interesting than a lunatic if you ask me there's also a lot of comedy in this film and the first third of the movie could easily be the set up for a straight comedy film but once the characters enter the central location a sinister funeral home known as house' the film morphs into the horror film that you would expect given the title the plot line is as simple as you'd expect it to be and we follow a bunch of kids that decide to put on a halloween party inside said funeral home this turns out to be a bad idea however once it transpires that the house is possessed and the demons start to inhabit the kids' bodies their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream but finding the gate to the grounds isn't as easy as it sounds br br the film's centrepiece is the gothic mansion where the action takes place this creaky old house makes for a great horror film location the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this director kevin tenney shoots the house well and a particularly good job is done of establishing the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and escape is difficult the comedy towards the start of the film is generally very funny and i was hoping it would keep up the laughs once the horror starts the film does have its comedy moments when the kids enter hull house but it's never overly funny and it's obvious that horror is the film's main aim not that this is a problem but the night of the demons could have been a lot better had it fused these elements properly the characters are pretty much what you'd expect from this sort of film but the acting suits the movie well and it's clear that the young cast had a good time making this movie and it translates well to the screen the effects are good in that they suit the film well and as most of the death sequences are well executed it's a good bet that most people won't get bored watching this this isn't a classic or must see film but i can highly recommend it as it offers a good time and will appeal to fans of silly horror fodder
<START> i remember seeing this film when i was 13 years old and i fell in love with it and i was a big fan of the film and the characters i adored my favorite character was stacey heidi because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in fred cameron dye who really liked her and i was hoping that in the end that they would get together then her boring boyfriend ralphie christopher murray because he ignored her and hung out with his friends i love the cast and the story i always love the part when fred try to get together with stacey and i always remember when he chased her around the car but it was so good i'll always remember cherish that in my teen years now that i am 33 years old and i picked up my copy on dvd and will look forward seeing it
<START> i've never been a big larry clark fan but somehow i've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies now i like independent films and i grew up very much into punk rock and i'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences not every punk song incorporates oi into its as they do in this particular film br br but the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion clark has made his living pretending that his fictionalized stories are how kids really are and as such you'll allow him ten minute scenes of stupid dialog that go nowhere because that's the cinema verite feel he's going for however when he shoots a ridiculous death scene pick any of them save for the opening drive by the over stylized attempts at what i assume is intended to be black humor are completely out of context ridiculously shot in most cases far worse than a student film and absolutely ludicrous in terms of the story john cassavettes and date movie make poor bedfellows as the forays into the latter style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie a really really bad one at that
<START> first of all i dunno if i was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget here we go br br basically there were so many years and gaps that i don't understand its like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so much gaps that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen and why i think this is a big flow forget the reviews who keeps whining about the history this movie doesn't have only history facts issues but also has so many flaws so most of the people keep saying watch this in cinema you will lose all cinematography like rivers deserts etc thats true they are beautiful thats why i waited for bluray release ok beautiful scenes but whats the point of that i turned off the movie after 1 hour and half i just lost interest the movie kept on doing the exact same things jumping in years at least mr director put for example after 2 years after 10 years i mean i couldn't watch the movie i lost understanding of whats going on anyways i wish i could include spoilers but when u decide to watch this movie just ask yourself how did this happen you will know what i mean don't watch this movie its a waste of time
