<START> please give this one a miss br br kristy swanson and the rest of the cast rendered terrible performances the show is flat flat flat br br i don't know how michael madison could have allowed this one on his plate he almost seemed to know this wasn't going to work out and his performance was quite lacklustre so all you madison fans give this a miss
<START> this film requires a lot of patience because it focuses on mood and character development the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set in frances austen's the sandy dennis character apartment but the film builds to a disturbing climax br br the characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery it's very interesting that robert altman directed this considering the style and structure of his other films still the trademark altman audio style is evident here and there i think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by sandy dennis it's definitely one of her darker characters but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary michael burns does a good job as the mute young man regular altman player michael murphy has a small part the solemn moody set fits the content of the story very well in short this movie is a powerful study of loneliness sexual repression and desperation be patient soak up the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script br br i praise robert altman this is one of his many films that deals with unconventional fascinating subject matter this film is disturbing but it's sincere and it's sure to elicit a strong emotional response from the viewer if you want to see an unusual film some might even say bizarre this is worth the time br br unfortunately it's very difficult to find in video stores you may have to buy it off the internet
<START> many animation buffs consider wladyslaw starewicz the great forgotten genius of one special branch of the art puppet animation which he invented almost single handedly and as it happened almost accidentally as a young man starewicz was more interested in entomology than the cinema but his unsuccessful attempt to film two stag beetles fighting led to an unexpected breakthrough in film making when he realized he could simulate movement by manipulating beetle carcasses and photographing them one frame at a time this discovery led to the production of amazingly elaborate classic short the cameraman's revenge which he made in russia in 1912 at a time when motion picture animation of all sorts was in its infancy br br the political tumult of the russian revolution caused starewicz to move to paris where one of his first productions coincidentally was a dark political satire variously known as frogland or the frogs who wanted a king a strain of black comedy can be found in almost all of films but here it is very dark indeed aimed more at grown ups who can appreciate the satirical aspects than children who would most likely find the climax upsetting i'm middle aged and found it pretty upsetting myself and indeed prints of the film intended for english speaking viewers of the 1920s were given title cards filled with puns and quips in order to help soften the sharp sting of the finale br br our tale is set in a swamp the frogland commonwealth where the citizens are unhappy with their government and have called a special session to see what they can do to improve matters they decide to beseech jupiter for a king the crowds are impressively animated in this opening sequence it couldn't have been easy to make so many frog puppets look alive simultaneously while jupiter for his part is depicted as a droll white bearded guy in the clouds who looks like he'd rather be taking a nap when jupiter sends them a tree like god who regards them the frogs decide that this is no improvement and demand a different king irritated jupiter sends them a stork br br delighted with this formidable looking new king who towers above them the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries the mayor steps forward to hand him the key to the commonwealth as newsreel cameras record the event to everyone's horror the stork promptly eats the mayor and then goes on a merry rampage swallowing citizens at random a title card dryly reads news of the king's appetite throughout the kingdom when the now terrified frogs once more beseech jupiter for help he loses his temper and showers their community with lightning bolts the moral of our story delivered by a hapless frog just before he is eaten is let well enough alone br br considering the time period when this startling little film was made and considering the fact that it was made by a russian Ã©migrÃ© at the height of that beleaguered country's civil war it would be easy to see this as a parable about those events starewicz may or may not have had russia's turmoil in mind when he made frogland but whatever prompted his choice of material the film stands as a cautionary tale of universal application frogland could be the soviet union italy germany or japan in the 1930s or any country of any era that lets its guard down and is overwhelmed by tyranny it's a fascinating film even a charming one in its macabre way but its message is no joke
<START> i generally love this type of movie however this time i found myself wanting to kick the screen since i can't do that i will just complain about it this was absolutely idiotic the things that happen with the dead kids are very cool but the alive people are absolute idiots i am a grown man pretty big and i can defend myself well however i would not do half the stuff the little girl does in this movie also the mother in this movie is reckless with her children to the point of neglect i wish i wasn't so angry about her and her actions because i would have otherwise enjoyed the flick what a number she was take my advise and fast forward through everything you see her do until the end also is anyone else getting sick of watching movies that are filmed so dark anymore one can hardly see what is being filmed as an audience we are impossibly involved with the actions on the screen so then why the hell can't we have night vision

<START> i'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold all who love this movie should email disney and increase the demand for it they'd eventually have to sell it then i'd buy copies for everybody i know everything and everybody in this movie did a good job and i haven't figured out why disney hasn't put this movie on dvd or on vhs in rental stores at least i haven't seen any copies this is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all the kids in the new generation don't get to see it and i think they should it should at least be put back on the channel this movie doesn't deserve a cheap download it deserves the real thing i'm them now this movie will be on dvd
<START> originally supposed to be just a part of a huge epic the year 1905 depicting the revolution of 1905 potemkin is the story of the mutiny of the crew of the potemkin in odessa harbor the film opens with the crew protesting meat and the captain ordering the execution of the an uprising takes place during which the revolutionary leader is killed this crewman is taken to the shore to lie in state when the townspeople gather on a huge flight of steps overlooking the harbor czarist troops appear and march down the steps breaking up the crowd a naval squadron is sent to retake the potemkin but at the moment when the ships come into range their crews allow the to pass through eisenstein's non historically accurate ending is open ended thus indicating that this was the seed of the later bolshevik revolution that would bloom in russia the film is broken into five parts men and maggots drama on the an appeal from the dead the odessa steps and meeting the squadron br br eisenstein was a revolutionary artist but at the genius level not wanting to make a historical drama eisenstein used visual texture to give the film a newsreel look so that the viewer feels he is eavesdropping on a thrilling and politically revolutionary story this technique is used by the battle of algiers br br unlike eisenstein relied on or the casting of non professionals who had striking physical appearances the extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers from potemkin this technique is later used by frank capra in mr deeds goes to town and meet john doe but in potemkin no one individual is cast as a hero or heroine the story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect known as montage the editing and selection of short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer d w griffith also used the montage but no one mastered it so well as eisenstein br br the artistic filming of the crew sleeping in their is complemented by the graceful swinging of tables suspended from chains in the galley in contrast the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their rage with injustice br br eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity the breaking of a plate bearing the words give us this day our daily bread signifies the beginning of the end this technique is used in last year at marienbad also when the ship's surgeon is tossed over the side his nez dangles from the rigging it was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the maggot infested meat this sequence ties the punishment to the corruption of the czarist era br br the most noted sequence in the film and perhaps in all of film history is the odessa steps the broad expanse of the steps are filled with hundreds of extras rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit yet the visual images of the deaths of a few will last in the minds of the viewer forever br br the angular shots of marching boots and legs descending the steps are cleverly accentuated with long menacing shadows from a sun at the top of the steps the pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians who summon up courage to beg them to stop a close up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller in bonnie in clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the czarist regime br br the death of a young mother leads to a baby carriage careening down the steps in a sequence that has been copied by hitchcock in foreign correspondent by terry gilliam in brazil and brian depalma in the untouchables this sequence is shown repeatedly from various angles thus drawing out what probably was only a five second event br br potemkin is a film that the revolutionary spirit celebrates it for those already committed and it for the unconverted it seethes of fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent czarist regime its greatest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved on techniques invented in russia several generations ago
<START> the emperor's richard haydn dog is betrothed to johanna's joan fontaine dog however when virgil bing crosby arrives in town to sell a record player to the emperor his dog is attacked by johanna's dog after a revenge attack where virgil is banished from town a psychoanalyst insists that johanna's dog must confront dog so that she can overcome her doggy fears this is arranged and the dogs fall in love so do virgil and johanna the rest of the film passes by with romance and at the end johanna's dog gives birth but who is the father br br the dog story is the very weak vehicle that is used to try and create a story between humans its a terrible storyline there are 3 main musical pieces all of which are rubbish bad songs and dreadful choreography its just an extremely boring film bing has too many words in each sentence and delivers them in an almost irritating manner its not funny ever but its meant to be bing and joan have done much better than this
<START> hollywood had a long love affair with bogus arabian nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time the most memorable were the jon hall maria montez films which have long since become camp this one is filled with dubbed songs anachronistic slang and slapstick it's a truly crop of corn and pretty near intolerable today it was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age consisting mainly of trick photography the only outstanding positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity sad to say of the many films made in this genre few of them come up to alexander korda's original thief of baghdad almost any other arabian nights film is superior to this one though it's a loser
<START> this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped though i will concede that the ideas behind batman forever were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director as it turned out this was not to be the case br br apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series i fail to understand how batman returns can be considered at all disappointing br br true it is not quite the equal of the first film though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in batman a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film true to the way the batman was always meant to be and highly satisfying br br michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne with tycoon max schreck christopher walken named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor his partner in crime oswald cobblepot the penguin danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier's richard iii and selina kyle the catwoman michelle pfeiffer whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman the four principals turn in excellent performances especially walken and devito while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities br br there are some intriguing concepts in this film about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain to the script in some places which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a four cornered fight there simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on br br nevertheless this is a damn good film i highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton
<START> inspired by hitchcock's strangers on a train concept of two men swapping murders in exchange for getting rid of the two people messing up their lives throw momma from the train is an original and very inventive comedy take on the idea it's a credit to danny devito that he both wrote and starred in this minor comedy gem br br anne ramsey is the mother who inspires the film's title and it's understandable why she gets under the skin of danny devito with her sharp tongue and relentlessly putting him down for any minor infraction billy crystal is the writer who's wife has stolen his book idea and is now being lionized as a great new author even appearing on the oprah show to in adulation he should be enjoying thus devito gets the idea of swapping murders to rid themselves of these nuisance factors br br of course everything and anything can happen when writer carl reiner lets his imagination roam with unending ideas for how the plot develops and it's amusing all the way through providing plenty of laughs and chuckles along the way as well as a good deal of suspense br br for devotees of black comedy this one is guaranteed to please
<START> when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry it completely blew in my opinion i didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell let's see i'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong my guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff oh noes what is happening oh its a dream oh its not a dream oh wait i see something spooky oh never mind sucky storyline those sequels don't even require the box to be opened or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead the first 3 sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place nothing fantasy nothing weird the box got opened boom they came was the only one that could bargain her way out of it first because of uncle frank then because she had information about the this movie at least attempts to stick to all that even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser no i'm pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series now they are remaking 1 and i don't even think i will watch it oh who am i kidding i probably will and probably will be disappointed again
<START> oh dear oh dear it really gets on my nerves when a low budget pointless horror affair tries to look interesting in the credits by having a bunch of good names pop up in the cast only to involve each one in the smallest most pointless possible roles in this film we have richard lynch in one scene a momentary appearance from martin kove a brief spot for vernon welles slightly more time on screen for john philip law and a little time for karen black this bunch of random cameos does not really add up to much though richard lynch and karen black do raise some of the few smiles of this film with their appearances and its quite painful really as none of the main cast are much good at all i couldn't help but think that if more scenes were filmed with any of the b movie veterans above the film would be a whole lot better but as it is there are just a few tantalising glimpses of good entertainment without the film ever actually attaining much entertainment value of the main cast the only charismatic or likable performances in my opinion were steve as axel and his girlfriend who i believe was played by elina madison never heard of her before but she has some measure of screen presence and is a good looker the plotting in this one is simple evil undead miner goes after those who eek to steal his gold and it should make for good slasher fun especially given that it is directed by john carl who has done special effects for many of these sort of films including having worked on all three of the major slasher franchises halloween elm street and friday 13th and such small gems as mausoleum unfortunately the film is sadly lacking in suspense likability and satisfying gore there are one or two mildly gory moments but nothing worth the effort of watching the film i wouldn't say in fact aside from the above mentioned cameos this entire movie is really quite stale and turgid with characters that couldn't get offed quick enough for my liking and an unfortunate lack of any real interest i didn't even find it fun in a laughable bad movie sense which is rare for me since i love a lot of pretty crummy films i'd say avoid
<START> i started watching this because i thought it was a really shitty porno as i kept watching the only thrill i got from this movie was finding out what the name of it was so i could look it up and rip on it i just finished it and have considered ending my life knowing that someone actually made this movie br br for the people who commented on this movie as having a good script and great acting my words of wisdom for you are that you probably have no friends because you were in the movie you are probably wishing you had all that time back of your life that you wasted on making this movie br br there is no way that this is a serious movie there was an old guy that gets stabbed and it doesn't even hurt him at all and when everyone else gets stabbed they drop dead br br it was probably important that these people killed random people and ate them and also hung out with an 80 year old man that wanted to put the parts into his body br br my favorite part was when the old man found the or however you spell it because that made the movie seem very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd br br what really blew my mind that they decided to throw in that random scene about the college girls going into the woods looking for fake skulls br br if you do attempt to see this movie you should probably fill up your bathtub and drop your hairdryer in it and be ready to jump in br br this is a must see for anyone who believes there life could not get any worse because this will help you realize there are people out there the makers of this movie who are even more pathetic and are going no where in life
<START> a touching documentary that puts a human face on the tragedy of 9 11 by showing how one small community to honor two high school friends lost on that day the film interweaves the lives of chris and tom through interviews with family and friends and snippets of old photos through their reminiscences we glimpse two lives tragically cut short the film also documents how through a series of coincidences an inspirational memorial garden was brought forth through the efforts of many people both known and unknown to the two victims through the laughter and the tears and the sweat we see the power of hope and honor and love this films evokes many different emotions but the final feeling is one of admiration of the human spirit by tragedy
