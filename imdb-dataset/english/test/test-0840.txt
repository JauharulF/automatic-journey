<START> as a professional poker dealer for over 25 years i found this movie very hard to watch too unreal it seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care the card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game common sense right plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks who couldn't do that the cheating was amateur stuff marked cards etc would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards would you sit in a game where the players push their chips into the middle of a pot constantly mixing them in then just how much they bet c'mon i gave it a 4 because the twists and turns might be interesting to some people but for those who know how to play the game it will be pretty painful next time they should use real players and get some insight on how to do it right ouch
<START> i would love for members of the cast and crew to sit down and do an audio commentary on this movie all of the different places that they went to film this movie should provide for some very good anecdotes fans of this movie would love to know br br what kind of permission did they have to get to film at certain locations br br were there any memorable outtakes br br were there any scenes that were deleted br br what challenges did the cast and the crew face br br did any actors have stunt doubles br br what was it like to work with other members of the cast br br were any of the scenes ad libbed br br what are members of the cast and crew up to now br br what locations are still there and what locations are no longer there or are now a different business br br it is one thing to read trivia about this movie on this site and other web sites but there is just no comparison to getting it straight from the horse's mouth br br come on guys get together and do a commentary never walk away from a challenge go for the gusto
<START> like curse of the komodo was for the creature feature genre jim cheerleader massacre is a straight faced parody of slasher movies such as slumber party massacre a psycho who has escaped from his padded cell he was sent to the loony bin thanks to killing eleven people is working across the mountainous backwoods countryside of bobcat county attacking anyone within his reach a van load of cheerleaders their teacher two equipment hands and the driver are on their way to a contest when their vehicle runs out of fuel while taking a supposed short cut to avoid having to turn back luckily the group find a cabin up ahead but fall prey to a killer who attacks each victim one by one the psycho loose in the county couldn't have killed one girl because she was in the locker room while he was elsewhere which means someone among their own is the culprit meanwhile the sheriff of the county and his deputy pursue the whereabouts of their psycho while also trying to find the location of the missing cheerleader squad br br shot cheap on video wynorski does what he can with the limited budget having to find clever ways to assassinate characters off screen without the luxury of properly effective special effects in other words lots of melons were stabbed the sound effect used to let us know that certain victims whisked away into the darkness by a black gloved hand died savagely wynorski incorporates a scene from slumber party massacre regarding brinke stevens' character linda her being pursued by a killer with a drill that killer and linda both wound up dead but i guess wynorski wanted to connect his film to that one albeit rather poorly still it was nice to see her even if it was a glorified cameo sheffield as ms the teacher of the students in trouble has a long bathing scene in the shower her naked body and fake breasts the girls who make up the cheerleaders are a bit unconvincing because their obviously in their twenties aging soft core porn stars samantha philips as a police officer who is attacked by the psychopath she's searching for and nikki fritz a hiker who is victimized while jogging across a dangerous bridge surprisingly don't have to strip wynorski vets bill monroe as sheriff murdock and melissa as a detective who assists murdock on his case contribute to the sub plot of the search for john colton's serial killer mcpherson interesting enough the mcpherson story serves as a as in truth the meat of the film is devoted to the cheerleading group and their perilous situation i'm not sure if slasher fans will embrace this movie because it takes too long for the kills to flare up and when they eventually enter the picture the violence isn't potent or shocking enough to satisfy
<START> i went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor telling from my first sentence i don't like that humor and this movie had it's moments but i loved it justin long has really never done comedy like this where he's sarcastic and clever and i loved it lewis black enough said the ending i really did love because it had to take itself seriously i mean how else would you end it yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs it was people coming together for one common goal to go to college where they were accepted the cast was amazing and yes i did laugh at loud when i didn't think i would and the laughter lasted longer then i thought to the parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary the movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to they played in to the story very well and i loved the familiar faces anthony boston public jeremy howard i galaxy quest with justin long ross patterson the new guy and sam brink blake lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable as well as b's friends i recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line
<START> as a flagship show attack of the show is endemic of the larger fall of g4 tv it is a show and a station that has fallen so far that it parades sex to try and cover its glaring faults its predecessor the screen was a venue for technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology it was a nice show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the and other experiments the crew could put to together br br the acquisition of by g4 bothered some longtime fans of the station but early returns were actually promising the emphasis on gaming was a nice addition and i really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of and other big entertainment events br br unfortunately now stands as but a shell of its former self those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men the result is that spends as much time parading olivia munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games it is so bad it is practically unwatchable br br while some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went equally troubling young gamers who might tune into g4 thinking their getting gaming that active gaming group between 10 15 are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience on a channel like hbo or cinemax things like that are expected on g4 it's tragic br br at least another male aimed channel has good programming like csi and g4 has very little good left to offer br br too bad really
<START> jefferson in paris is a truly confounding film it presents thomas jefferson nick nolte in the most unflattering light possible painting him as a liar racist and pedophile yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins this is the way he was the film seems to say end of sentence end of movie the door's behind you br br after arriving in paris with his daughter patsy paltrow jefferson proceeds to win the heart of maria greta scacchi the wife of a homosexual english painter the criminally underused simon callow a turn of events sends maria to england however and jefferson proceeds to forget her with astonishing speed for a man who mere minutes of screen time before was asking her to live with him in america br br he's been bewitched you see by sally hemmings thandie newton one of his slaves just arrived from america just why he's bewitched is hard to tell although sally is undeniably beautiful she acts like a simple minded child in front of jefferson when she isn't telling ghost stories in exaggerated speech patterns she's slinking around his bedroom practically oozing lust for her distinguished br br if her behavior is an attempt to excuse it doesn't work jefferson damns himself further when maria tired of waiting for his letters travels from england to see him i've not changed toward you he insists offering weak excuses for not writing to her credit maria sees through his brazen lies immediately when sally appears and she and jefferson flirt openly and cruelly to my mind in maria's very presence the illusion falls apart completely br br no one today believes that jefferson washington and the rest were utter of virtue and morality yet are we supposed to believe that the learned distinguished jefferson would be attracted to sally a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how frenchie friends aw corn and who rubs herself against his front as she passes right before maria's eyes br br even if we let that slide it's followed by the horrifying revelation that sally was only 15 when this affair took place jefferson was 41 strangely this fact comes out only toward the very end when sally's brother james is furious at her blase announcement that she is carrying child br br jefferson is equally blase when told that sally is carrying his child and tells her that she'd be far better off under his protection than free and living in france with her brother but he promises i'll free her when i die and our children including any more that come jefferson says in a chilling declaration of sally as his when they reach 21 oh thank you you feel like telling the screen big deal br br the worst scene is still to come however involving daughter patsy she is already angry at him first for breaking his vow made to her mother on her deathbed not to marry again obviously the woman wasn't just talking about matrimony jefferson has also refused to allow patsy to become a nun as she wishes despite earlier moralizing about freedom of religion that seems to mean freedom to agree with him br br having promised sally and her brother their freedom jefferson calls in patsy to witness the bargain and promise to fulfill it should anything happen to him sally's brother blurts out the impending birth of the child and jefferson asks do you swear paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant although she has almost nothing to say her face nearly contorts in agonizing pain at this revelation yet she controls her grief and whispers yes br br if anything and the filmmakers could have had something if they'd emphasized this point more jefferson in paris is an indication of the status of woman in the late 18th century viewed even by men like jefferson as attractive property pleasing but without true intellect or souls we see jefferson shed a few tears over a letter from maria obviously telling him where to get off but he's soon laughing away at a wild dance from sally complete with tossed hair and heaving bosom br br i don't know whether this is an accurate portrait of jefferson or not i don't care to watch it however just for the sake of watching it this jefferson is no hero or even an anti hero he's a selfish lying child and one who gets away with it not the kind of man i want to see a movie about
<START> it stars war correspondent william holden separated who falls in love with a stunning eurasian doctor jessica jones set against the stunning backdrop of hong kong the cinematography is magnificent as they rendezvous on a hill overlooking hong kong the story deals with racial tensions society frowning on mixed relations and extra marital affairs but what i love about it is the strong character of the heroine portrayed by jessica jones who is a eurasian doctor who stays humble and steadfast in her altruistic mission and stays loyal to her love despite that she gets sacked at her hospital for cavorting with a married man by high rankers one day william holden is called to the korean war which he covers and then that ill fated day she gets the news of his demise the end of course is tragic i cried when she went to their hill it was a very sweet ill fated love affair it defeats all the odds the fact that she got fired from her job how his wife would not grant him a divorce yet their great love persevered they experienced a great love despite it all i personally do not believe in extramarital affairs and think he should have not started something when he was bound to someone else and she should not have allowed herself to let it happen but despite that a truly magnificent movie i think the heroine overshadowed the hero jessica jones is sultry and gave a magnificent performance although i thought it strange they didn't not hire a real asian actress or someone with asian blood i agree with one review jessica jones oozes sexuality when she lays on the ground and looks up at william holden speaking calmly but her eyes say come take me now br br i find it a pity most great films were made before i was born it seems many hollywood movies are lacking in depth great acting and depend entirely on stunts and heavy sex scenes this is truly one of the greatest ill fated love stories in movies
<START> this is a spectacular production i have seen the show live twice in chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that i was able to perceive only fragments of what was going on the stage consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform and as the action moves from one part of the stage to the next sometime you loose track of what is going on no matter where you are located as always this is a thought provoking sensory overload skillfully captured in high definition with 15 cameras the footage was masterfully edited one of the best concert dvds of all times in my opinion i only hope and wish that they will release this on blu ray of hd dvd so that we can re live this extravaganza over and over again
<START> rush in rio is no doubt one of the most exciting dvds i have purchased although i am a biased rush fan of almost 20 years i found this performance to be flawless the music is heavy and sharp which sounds great on any surround sound system the band is energetic the crowd has a constant smile it's like they were able to capture every concert i've been to for any rush fan this dvd is a must if anything just to see the boys in brazil documentary which reveals the travels of this rather isolated personal band for any non rush fan this dvd is an enjoyable concert rush fans know the talent of these three canadians we have rather firmly stood by them for years i've shown this dvd or portions of it anyway to those who have never heard of rush or those who think rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock i e sex drugs and a drunken frenzy the bottom line is this dvd is worth every penny and more than worth the time to view it
<START> out of any category this is one demented and over the edge film even in todays standards filmed entirely in crap o rama this film will blow your mind and something else too br br the amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is astonishing the dialog is breathtakingly fast and campy you'll either love or hate this film but give it go i've seen it 4 times and absolutely love it divine is in the quest for being the filthiest person alive but so are her rivals too in this obscene and disgusting but funny and stylish little film br br divine was phenomenal and she will always be missed greatly edith massey does the unforgettable performance as the and don't forget the energetic mink stole br br crazy s t br br recommended also for you sick little puppies br br female trouble br br desperate living br br polyester
<START> michael caine might have tried to make a larger than life character to a successful degree but the whole storyline and character's around him where not likable or interesting at all it was all very boring and somewhat predictable martin landau a favorite actor of mine had a nothing role he was useless michael caine got a bit irritating after a while and the film couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller caine tries hard and good on him but i felt the direction and storyline let him down don't waste your time it starts off well for the first 10 minutes and then that's about it a film for die hard caine fans only stay away from this one
<START> iÂ´m from germany so please excuse my style of writing as iÂ´ve seen chucky 4 for the first time i was a bit surprised i knew chucky as a usual 80s but bride of chucky was very different from the old ones first there is the artwork of the very good director ronny yu who we still have in mind from a chinese ghost story his visual style is in a wired kinda way comparable to francis ford coppola also the voices of chucky an tiff are very impressive iÂ´ve also liked the screenplay very much especially the scene in which tiff throws the in the br br i give it a 9 0 vote for funny gory and progressive entertainment if you have any comments on my opinion just send me an e mail

<START> the gymnast 2006 was written and directed by ned farr weber portrays jane hawkins a former world class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist br br the promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around jane's accidental reunion with a former teammate although this meeting takes place that plot line is secondary to the main plot which involves jane her husband and a professional dancer named serena the two women develop an act of the type performed by de soleil the two complement each other jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength serena is more elegant and artistic although obviously also capable of incredible physical feats br br the film works because we can understand how jane would turn to who is caring and compassionate while jane's husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage br br both women are incredibly fit and athletic and has the lean body and well defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts they clearly are truly performing their act and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed be a success in las vegas or anywhere else they traveled br br the sexual tension between the women is obvious and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air a woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation which isn't resolved in a neat and tidy fashion br br of the six films we saw at the rochester ny lesbian and gay film and video festival we thought this one was the best it will work on dvd and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen note stay for the credits
<START> it is hard to know what category to put this film in most films set in this time period of us history are westerns but here instead of the wide open plains of the west the action is almost entirely confined to a claustrophobic girls boarding school in louisiana br br the film opens with amy a young girl walking though the woods picking mushrooms as she does so she stumbles upon corporal john a wounded union soldier who she takes back to the school we know that he isn't a particularly nice person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from alerting a passing confederate patrol even though she told him she was twelve br br once back at the school opinions are divided about what should be done with their new guest some think they should look after him till his wounds are healed while others believe that it is treason not to hand him over to confederate forces at the first opportunity the former group prevail and he gradually recovers as he does so his presence has an effect on all of the girls who haven't had a man on site for a long time including a young teacher and the head mistress who's previous relationship appears to have been with her own brother sets about seducing them emotionally if not physically this leads to considerable jealousy amongst the girls br br while this film is rated fifteen it is definitely not for younger viewers both for the sexual content of which little is actually shown but much is implied and for a very gruelling scene which had me squirming more than any other scene in any film i've seen for quite some time it is interesting to see clint eastwood play against type instead of being heroic his character is both unpleasant and for most of the time at the mercy of the women around him the acting is solid throughout not just from eastwood but also from all the actresses including the young pamelyn ferdin who played amy
