<START> no movie i've ever seen before has even come close to being as boring and stupid as this hunk of junk and i have always been a big b movie fan after viewing this total piece of crap though i can honestly say that this doesn't even come close to being a b movie br br no one in this movie could act if their life depended on it the script is so stupid i don't think i've ever heard anyone talk like this in my life the writer should go spend a few years studying real life people to see just how they act and talk even then they would not be able to make a watchable movie because it is so obvious that no one involved in this movie has any talent driving them at all br br i could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monster toys also forget about any sexy scenes the women in the leather outfits are so grotesque you would sooner puke than get turned on br br avoid this pointless drivel unless you want to be bored out of your mind
<START> this is another one of those movies i just knew i would hate but it ended up not being as bad as one would expect br br it has a lot of t a in it and even the dvd menu is chocked full of women's breast the first few scenes of the movie has a lot of sex and nudity and i was beginning to think there would be no story at all just exploiting nudity for the sake of making money off a popular prequel 8mm br br as i continued to watch there was just more sex and nudity and main characters that i could care less about but then the story started to unfold and i started to see a point to it all and it was a tad better br br it is about a man who's fiancÃ© is the daughter of an and they all have a promising future until nude photos of a menage a trois sex act shows up and blackmail is in the cards the man and his fiancÃ© must now get to the bottom of who sent the pics and how to shut them up br br the movie first of all is nothing to do with part 1 it doesn't even have anything to do with its about a sex video though so i can see the similarities as small as they may be br br the acting is neither good nor bad its just nobodies playing parts anybody could do the films production value is middle of the road and its pure drama yawn br br i did enjoy going along for the ride getting to the bottom of the blackmailers motives i was anticipating answers which is way more than i could say for the first one which i consider garbage this movie has some nice twists too which are always welcomed br br it's not great and it is very slow started but it does ultimately entertain i wasn't on the edge of my seat and i won't rave to my friends that this is a must see but hey if you watch a lot of movies and always seek something new this might entertain you for 90 minutes
<START> i've seen this movie more than once it isn't the greatest scifi flick i've every seen but it is not a bad movie the acting is good and the characters are more real than most in low budget sci fi at least it isn't full of dumb bimbos like so many other low budget scifi i especially like elizabeth pena she is a good actress and she does worried single mother as well as any and better than some br br don't let the nay sayers run you off see it for yourself and judge it for yourself
<START> this show is made for persons with iq lower than 80 the jokes in the show are so lame if you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage you will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform it really pisses me of that viewers gave reba 6 7 on their voting sure i knew there are some people with iq lower than 80 but what i did not know that there are so many of them so people if you got to read this i hope that you will never ever download or buy this peace of garbage i know it is not the place for his but i wish to recommend one much better mini series
<START> the very first time i heard of latter days was when i was renting dvd's and i was interested as i am a member of the lds church i found this movie very heartfelt and in several areas it made me cry the reason for this is that too many years ago i knew a young man who went through what aaron played by steve does in latter days but unlike aaron this dear young man did not survive the ordeal he ended up taking is life after his church his friends and his family disowned him because he was gay there have been many people who do not think that the things that are shown in the movie really happen in this day and age but the sorry and sad thing is they do for those of you out their who are gay and young you need to see this movie and if you are a gay mormon you really need to see this movie plus if you get the dvd there is help for you listed in the dvd teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie touches it but that part is hidden to a degree the acting and the music is excellent this movie sold out every movie house that it showed but it only showed in major cities and had a very limited release so for those who would like to see this movie i would recommend the dvd release the only people that i know who did not like the movie are members of my own church and they did not see the movie because of the subject matter gays and the lds church see the movie experience the story and feel the emotions that are showcased in this movie you i feel will not be disappointed
<START> let me just say that granny was extremely well made with the horror violence and sure suspense moves the best indie horror movie i have ever seen that is only 58 minutes long it is my 5 out of 20 most favorite movie of all time you people should love this i give it a 10 out of 10
<START> i'm very surprised that so many people don't like this movie i think it's a lot better than most of the teen films that have come out recently ten things i hate about you can we say teeny bopper film and what was with the principle writing those porno novels cruel intentions where a character gives up their virginity because of a fun car ride and she's all that mediocre if your looking for something that's just fun i say go with never been kissed my mom loved it and she hates movies one of her favorites is beaches this is a great fantasy about what you would do different if you could go back to high school people who were outcasts in high school will probably like this movie better it reminds me of and high school reunion' and the ending puts me in the best mood sure the plot has been done but how many recent movies can you honestly say haven't been done in one form or another the cast is also charming and for those who think drew can't be geeky she pulls it off just great another good teen comedy that i recommend which was made recently is election but it's more of a satire on school and politics
<START> debbie boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song you light up my life the didi conn film of the same name however was a horrifically embarrassing flop conn plays the stereotypically goofy homely vulnerable girl who is in love with michael who plays the stereotypical yuppie wannabe guy they are engaged but every one knows that isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built so only didi is surprised when he dumps her needless to say didi is quite embarrassed br br fortunately she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty she calls it can you guess you light up my life she hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life now i recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city and thinking well thank heavens we've finally got all the exposition out of the way now maybe something interesting will happen and something interesting did happen the credits rolled br br yep that was it not only was the movie badly acted badly written and badly filmed it also ended in the middle this movie is a really profoundly bad movie and we're not talking cult movie bad here we're talking unmitigated flop a real yawner from start to finish if you liked the debbie boone song by all means buy a copy of it but don't waste your time or money on this flick this is one movie you'll be glad you missed br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
<START> would you like to know why french and italians love hate each others would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime so go to watch film in original language of course and you can look at a wonderful monica bellucci who finally speaks her native language from cittÃ  di just at the border with tuscany and the rest of the characters speaking lovely sabrina and all the others daniel auteuil definitely in his shoes with napoleon a lot of fun a real fresco of the elba island landscape and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant good for all times
<START> antarctica winter 1982 the team on an american research base get surprised by a couple of mad norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter trying to kill it all the norwegians are killed and the americans are left with nothing but a dog a couple of bodies and questions that's the beginning of the greatest horror thriller film i've ever seen br br from the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense paranoid mood helpless and alone out in no mans land ennio morricone was nominated for a razzie award for his score why i don't know 'cause as far as i can see his score is simple creepy and very good it really gets you in the right mood br br the acting is great the best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing as for russell and the others on two legs i can say nothing less br br you may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive well think again you haven't seen it all until you've seen this falling off and creatures changing forms rob bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup br br the movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known in fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie nobody i've asked have heard of it however the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and dvd twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date this movie is to be considered a classic br br the movie is without doubt one of my if not my favorite i've seen it several times but it's just as good as the first time i saw it as a norwegian the only thing i don't like about this movie is that macready keeps calling the norwegians swedes
<START> portrayal of valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time it has been a long time since i have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way does with this character she was entirely believable as valeria and i was swept away with her characterisation of this role all at once the film was real life and fantasy the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound i was compelled to read between the lines and each of the key players utilized the art of body language and emotional intent to convey a strong story line in particular was visually stimulating in an almost asexual way and at the same time in a sexy way this comment can relate easily to each of the many emotions brought forward by her performance understated in terms of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence i have been captured by this actresses delivery and shall eagerly seek out much more of her work
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as personable as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by golly i'll be writing those recipes down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
<START> this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen i always liked chuck norris in films but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss marker i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting i know an african american who looks like this guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude br br chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets i think this show started great but lost steam as time went on br br they should have dumped chucks side kick
<START> murder over new york is fun but not as good as most of the other fox chans this film would have been better named charlie chan in new york the film's working title this is chance to play chan in the big apple there is a lot to like here though including guest star shemp howard of the three stooges br br this has one of my favorite chan sayings coincidence like ancient egg leave unpleasant toler and yung are good in this one and so is the supporting cast but there is little or no mysterious atmosphere which i look for in these films still it is good to see
<START> now this is more like it one of the best movies i have ever seen despite it made very well on all aspects this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate loosen up there are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand how entertaining and how captivating this movie was now this is what a movie ticket is all about you will get what you want from this movie's genre and all naysayers are those with the anti flynn syndrome this conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti elvis anti ali anti clinton anti kennedy usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs if the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art you will find this movie not only one of the best classics but also one of the best movies of all time i rate it the second best western ever right behind wayne's the cowboys
