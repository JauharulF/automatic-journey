<START> coming from the druggie generation i thought this movie was hilarious it definitely brought jekyll hyde up to date so to speak my husband and i laughed all the way through it would love to have the movie in my collection i told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it they aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie it's been so long since i've seen it i can't remember but a few things i would have to say the funniest part was when dr jekyll dozed off on his lab table and inhaled the straw while snoring then up the powdered drug he had invented funniest thing i'd ever seen in a movie
<START> darr although a copy of some hollywood flick is one of the best films i have seen it is not only beautifully portrayed but also has great songs and beautiful scenery shahrukh is his usual self his expressions and voice matches his character i was pleasantly surprised by sunny deol's portrayal in the film he is a bit romantic and lovable in the film unlike his other characters in his other films at times you feel like justice hasn't been done to his character sunny was intended to be portrayed as the good guy in the film but ends up looking like the villain at the end juhi chawla is beautiful and bubbly she is her usual self in short a great love story with passion
<START> hmmm started well like a hybrid of x files first wave unfortunately if the mere notion of da lost time machine is preposterous to you then the final between one man with a pistol and 4 16th century monks armed to the teeth with automatic weapons will seem positively ridiculous equalled only by poor acting poor script and screenplay or in other words giggle factor 5 captain
<START> i just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 years maybe close to 20 in some ways it was better than i remembered in other it was much worse br br first of all there's the music it's just plain awful there are only 5 songs in the movie most of them used more than once the opening song is by a chorus of annoying children and the disco y title track is performed by rick it doesn't get any worse than that even the background music is terrible with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes we also get some truly lame slapstick mostly in the opening credits br br on the other hand bill murray is spot on brilliant as usual you have to wonder if he ad libbed the whole thing or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines or maybe he's just that great turning a weak script into comic genius the best part are his surreal pa announcements lobsters get out of here you're a menace br br you also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this at least half the characters seem like real people and mostly real people you would like to have around even spaz gets to do a more than any other eddie type character ever did and when he gets the girl it's plausible she's not absurdly hot but he doesn't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls see revenge of the nerds for examples of both cinematic phenomenons br br and when the plot seems clichÃ©d well ya gotta wonder if it wasn't a clichÃ© yet when they made this while it wasn't the first summer camp movie ya gotta go back at least to the parent trap it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre in fact i was surprised that there was no talent show scene wet hot american summer spoofed the summer camp genre so perfectly i just assumed everything in it came straight out of meatballs i also half expected jon cryer to pull up in a convertible with a chimp thanks to mr show's epic camp olympiad spoof monk academy br br anyway this one seems to be vanishing a little as far as the late 70's early 80's comedies it's not a cable staple anymore and certainly doesn't have the cult following of caddyshack or animal house i was pleased to catch it on showtime today and in high definition at that sure it's pretty awful in spots but you could do a lot worse in a 70's 80's teen comedy and again murray is a genius
<START> i know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious it's not like american pie or something i know not why people are offended by the universal plugs since it's part of the plot the advertising is excusable br br this is a funny movie with good dialogue good subtle wit a good story a good moral that thankfully doesn't get too sappy great acting and a cheesy ending br br minor spoiler the basic premise here is the classic story of a shepherd boy who lies so much that no one believes him when the wolf giamatti comes along so he gets his best friend bynes and they go and drive the wolf crazy br br frankie can be annoying in other roles but not as jason shepherd he handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed br br amanda bynes what more can i say the girl's got the gift she's funny talented versatile and very very attractive i'm only 6 months older than her i need to get to california sometime soon in fact the 'best friend' part was originally a boy but became a girl as soon as the makers saw amanda's interest which works out pretty well since the part would've been pretty dull without the blessing of abilities br br paul giamatti is a very talented man while some would play marty wolf as evil and diabolical giamatti made him not just a jerk mind you but a likeable jerk a jerk that up the screen rather than intentionally dimming it and i doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that wolf undergoes as well br br all in all great movie loved seeing white able to mock himself loved seeing all the little references such built into the film one of the guests in the party scene is the director shawn levy another is former co star kenan thompson loved seeing amanda in those outfits get the dvd if you can it's got all kinds of great extra stuff and the lovely ms bynes is your guide through the menus
<START> do not expect a classic military comedy which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine kind of east german version of buffalo soldiers br br nva works on a meta level that it sympathizes with its heroes' attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can it's not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles utopian of course in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality but very thoughtful br br just to fill the required 10 lines do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job
<START> hi i am john and i would like to tell you all that my dog was in this film at the baiting screen he was the pit like one that was going to bite the man chained up my dogs name was colin and he stayed away filming for a week for this film he was also in other things like crime watch uk and some other small parts he won some dog shows but he has passed away now i miss him he was a great true and loyal dog and we had some great times together but he got cancer which could not be treated so i had to get him put down that was the worst day of my life i hope this gives you some thing to look for in the film if you watch it again br br thanks all
<START> it's literally the three stooges all over again without the charm this show's nothing more than the worst slapstick i'm surprised they actually have writers the so called jokes are completely haphazard and 'controversial' for no other point than trying very very hard to be controversial and people think this is 'edgy' get a clue this show takes absolutely no thought time effort money or creativity originality to produce any references present are geared toward anyone between the ages of 6 and 16 who would occasionally browse people magazine but i suppose this is only what all the kiddies want like and need today
<START> is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in indian cinema here is one good example to show how excellent writers directors and actors succumb to the producers here is one of the most wonderful actors mohanlal acting in a movie about a real story in kashmir the seriousness of the film is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs there is this character who in reality is the son of the producer of the film hence he doesn't have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so this kid doesn't know what is acting and he is the hero of the movie god help indian cinema with such producers br br this movie is a pathetic display of what happens in kashmir a sensible viewer can intuitively understand the constraints of such wonderful writers actors and directors who want to share their real life experiences but the unfortunate part is that a movie about the highest ranks in indian militia turns out to be a pathetic display that only makes one think that the movie was stupid br br we should oust such producers in the film industry and pave way for good cinema
<START> this was a sordid and dreary mess i needed a shower when it was over it goes something like this some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case she discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information since the detective is an attractive woman of course she is horny and intrigued which reveals much about hollywood and its psychosis about women what's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting just depressing and yucky ellen barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective and julian sands provides unintentional laughs as a cross dressing psychiatrist which is why it escapes a one star rating
<START> first of all it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film from belgium had to add that was communist if this user indeed watched the film the message was that he was not communist but pigeonholed by none other than belgium the u s the un etc as a communist leader for other individuals' and country's political and economic gains even if one decides to accept that the film partakes in revisionist history it would be naive to assume that was communist especially coming from the country which granted the congo independence and since was elected democratically to his seat as prime minister br br onto the film br br this is one of the most important and powerful films i have seen in quite some time depicting the struggles of the african freedom fighter and elected prime minister's struggles as its first leader mr peck does a quite commendable job of putting together all of the pieces into one work and this must have been quite some task due to the fact that most people outside of the congo and belgium likely do not know the history of and the congo outside of some light coverage of african imperialism hopefully in one of their high school secondary school or maybe university college level history classes he had his work cut out for him br br and to to think that oliver stone's jfk took over 3 hours runs under 2 hours and a most engaging 115 minutes it was as we find that his desire to not compromise with western powers whom he holds responsible for the atrocities to his people particularly belgium while trying to deal with power struggles within his own borders apparently even with some of his friends it is amazing that the man lived as long as he did br br this is a must see for anyone interested in equality justice humanity history politics and true freedom you will not be disappointed
<START> it seems no matter what i see her in christina ricci seems full of promise but fails to deliver sure she can cry and scream but prozac nation sees ricci totally out of her depth perhaps i'm being too harsh okay i'm shifting the blame to the director jessica lange is outrageous and almost reaches faye dunaway heights of unfortunately i think lange peaked with frances and it was all downhill from there there was every chance of this film being slick and witty while tackling depression head on what we get instead is poorly acted hysteria dressed up with a stereotypical try hard eighties veneer i really had no sense of the films eighties backdrop since i was unsatisfied with the lame attempt at making believe it was the eighties just because ms ricci wears a madonna inspired dress to her lost my virginity celebration cmon everyone you are all better than this the filmmakers should hang their heads in shame and as a result of disappointment elizabeth could probably make a bundle if she sued for emotional damages as a result of the finished product go on lizzie sue i would
<START> if you want a horrible interpretation of macbeth then this is your answer filled with archaic english language in a 21st century australian setting this film lives to disappoint and leave you scratching your head but that isn't all br br not only is there sophomoric action sequences but there are plenty of scenes where the female body is displayed the witches played by actresses that resemble school girls more than witches put on a soft porn display with macbeth in a unremarkable display of affection welcome to stupidity and depravity all at the same time br br its a wonder why this project was green lighted so much for modern cheesy movies d
<START> i have barely managed to view the entire film only after about out of the movie's did the journey to mars begin and then there were 5min left for the closure these 85 long minutes were very boring and didn't contribute anything to the film when finally reaching mars it wasn't much better plot wise it all could have been fitted into much shorter running time and nothing would have been missed br br what i cannot understand is the piece of trivia saying the because of the film new born babies were named why would someone want to name his her baby after a villain who despite having only one eyebrow apparently has 3 breasts br br the only interesting thing here is the sets and costumes for the mars scenes they are an interesting experiment in just as the cabinet of dr caligari was for expressionism five years earlier br br i give it 4 10 for the great looking design
<START> the gang is back for more ron howard and cindy williams are now married her brother is demonstrating against the draft and charles martin smith is doing everything he can in vietnam to get sent home br br the issues of the 60's are brought to light here but it's all over the place beginning with new year's eve 1963 then three minutes later it's new year's eve 1964 then three minutes later it's new year's eve 1965 then three minutes later it's back to 1963 again martin smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago and a couple of scenes later this friend is winning his next heat in a drag race and to top it all off the drug scene and the flower children enter the picture or pictures in some cases as many as three different camera shots are shown on the screen at the same time br br if you want to watch this film you have to watch this film but i'd advise you to stick to the original and leave it there wolfman jack is heard in the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background but where'd he go maybe he couldn't keep up with this film either and quit 2 out of 10 stars
