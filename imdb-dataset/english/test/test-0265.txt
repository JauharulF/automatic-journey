<START> i watched x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot frankly i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie i was wrong the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest starting with the opening sequence which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walker's beautiful wailing voice the film explores the identity crisis of pierre guillaume depardieu a brilliant choice for the role and his consequential self destruction the story is divided into two parts Â the first depicts carefree life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to paris to live in squalor with his supposed half sister both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography Â the first very colorful and bright the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic adding up to a true aesthetic feast x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience
<START> after nearly getting killed by a big dog a stray cat thinks to herself why can't i be a skunk then everyone would leave me alone she looks around the junkyard and gets an idea white paint black paint and some limburger cheese and some garlic hmmmm the next thing you know we have the forerunner to pepe le pew although in this cartoon she's still a cat she's a she and just a skunk in disguise br br the cat also is enjoying and taking full advantage of her new status as a smelly skunk he's a happy content guy now until a real skunk with the charles boyer imitation voice shows up br br i did appreciate the cat putting on a bugs bunny outfit however overall i never cared for these french takeoff characters finding the stereotypical dialog overdone and not really funny so i only rate this as fair i do this a point however for the moral at the end of the story
<START> first of all since i'm one of the people who never saw the mst3k chopped up version of this movie i can't comment on that br br however i did see the original version of this movie on the sci fi channel and i thought it was just as good as anything else on that channel in fact i thought it was one of their better offerings br br i've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about with a modicum of intelligence thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and rightly so in it's original cut most reasonable people i think would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10 five is average to me and i think this movie is about average for a sci fi pic br br in contrast to the above i've also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature dull and flip and as a result come off as boneheads from where i stand are the same ones who can't find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based mostly on seeing it chopped up and on mst3k or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly prejudiced by the mst3k viewing to begin with
<START> so it might not be entirely historically accurate and there is little or no real character development but for jake son of ridley scott's first attempt it's well worth the ticket price br br captain james jonny lee miller looking as good as ever may be a gentleman but he hasn't got the money or the clothes to prove it robert carlyle with all his clothes on is an turned outlaw the circumstances of their strange meeting involve a dead body a ruby and eventually a partnership as the gentlemen as the tag line says they rob the rich and that's it there isn't really much background or even in depth development but the object seems to be to relieve the aristocracy of enough money and jewels to pay for the two passage to america one small problem falls in love with the chief ward rebecca liv tyler who happens to also have caught the eye of the thief taker general br br the plot is original enough the casting is excellent especially alan cumming as the drag queenish lord rochester carlyle and miller also together in trainspotting they haven't lost their dynamic the costuming is fantastic the makeup is outrageous and the music is hard edged techno with a strangely classical undertone jake scott has an eye for light and shadow a good sense of balance between spectacle and plot and he isn't squeamish about showing the more unpleasant side of 17th century london and lucky for us he likes close ups of faces especially eyes jonny lee miller's eyes and liv tyler's too but hey who is this movie about rebecca no and but there's more to this movie than just pretty faces at the risk of sounding cliche it's a fast furious and sometimes frustrating ride with the most noble since robin hood decadent sleazy and violent scott's debut film makes for an entertaining evening at the movies br br as says i was terrific and it was a bloody good laugh
<START> my father insisted i should watch this film with him and i regret that i wasted my time watching i want that approximate hour and a half back the funny little film concerns the elderly don ameche staying with his son tom selleck it turns out that ameche isn't just forgetful like he's been told but has dementia it seems a lot like alzheimers and because dad is so frequently out to lunch he gets into so much trouble again and again almost like the adorable tyke from baby's day out the problem though is that you know baby's day out is all fantasy and the baby is going to be fine plus you aren't laughing at the baby for having a deformity or illness but in this case you are being encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind and where's the humor in that if this film had been more successful would the producers have then made films making fun or people with cerebral palsy or a flesh eating virus there are a lot of people who should have felt ashamed at having made this film
<START> no one really knows how the power came to be not even the book of damnation recorded its beginning but those who mastered it have always been the families of formed a covenant of bla bla bla after this intro we suddenly see take that or was it the backstreet boys perhaps well i don't know which of these they belong to but one thing's for sure the descendants of salem are a boy band can you tell them apart i couldn't if you can tell me which is which i'd very much appreciate it these boy band boys looks so damn seriously now is this a horror movie or a film for teenie boppers it's sad that the anyway weak horror genre has been kidnapped by teens and this is one of the i've seen so far the movie is visually solid but the cast is so bland the acting so awful that it was a trial finishing the movie as bad as the cast was after all boy bands and fashion models are rarely good actors the absolute stand out in this regard was the guy playing the villain sebastian stan this guy's overacting is right up there with the worst in the history of film i have rarely seen someone make such annoying and silly grimaces in such a short space of time what's worse he has the most baby face of all the boy band baby faces in the entire cast i mean it's a joke
<START> at one point in this waste of celluloid charles dance as some sort of meant to be funny cyborg bad guy says if i had an anus i'd soil myself br br quite
<START> i very nearly did not see 'hi de hi ' i think it must have been the title that put me off in those days the welsh language editions of 'the radio times' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about 'hi de hi ' suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by leslie or worse an inane u s import but i managed to catch a later episode and was surprised to find it written by jimmy perry and david croft br br as was the case with 'dad's army' and 'it ain't half hot mum' perry based it on personal experiences in this case his time at a holiday camp before cheap air travel came along in the '60's these camps sprang up along british providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners br br as a matter of interest i worked in one such camp in the '80's as a chef barry island south wales known to all and sundry as land' for reasons i won't go into br br set in the late '50's it began with university academic jeffrey simon taking over as the entertainments manager of a job he was ill equipped to handle his staff included resident comic ted paul shane his sidekick spike jeffrey holland miserable punch and judy man mr partridge leslie snobby ballroom dancers barry barry howard and yvonne stuart diane holland and the unforgettable gladys pugh ruth who lusted after at every opportunity bubbly su pollard stole the show though as cleaner peggy whose driving ambition was to be a all the important staff members wore them a number of sexy girls occupied these coats too most notably nikki kelly's and statuesque rikki howard's we never saw joe the owner he communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical which poor jeffrey was forced to read aloud hi de hi was the greeting usually met with the equally inane de ho br br one fan was the late sir fred who told perry and croft that he recognised most of the characters from real life br br i always found the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic like archie rice he was the comedian whose big break never came reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken late night audiences he took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks and in one memorable episode patience snapped and he sounded him out lies ted all lies br br as with every other perry croft series the cast were excellent particularly and shane ruth prissy got on my nerves no wonder anne robinson hates the welsh but leslie misanthropic 'mr and felix jockey 'fred more than compensated br br the visual gag everyone remembers is drunken mr partridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating br br with its frothy blend of '50's nostalgia and saucy gags 'hi was a big hit for b b c 1 in the '80's resulting in a massive increase in bookings for butlins and it went downhill when left to return to the theatre though i never took to his replacement squadron leader clive dempster david griffin worse leslie death robbed the show of one of its best characters kenneth connor was brought in to replace him as 'uncle br br the period setting occasionally caused problems in one episode sylvia and betty had to dive into the pool to rescue peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark the revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era still they looked great in them so who's complaining in another ted sang the tom jones hit to campers it was not composed by les reed and barry mason incidentally until 1968 br br closed its doors in 1988 and the last shot was that of peggy now a all alone in the camp jumping into the air and shouting what else 'hi de hi ' br br i don't rate it as highly as perry and croft's other shows but its popularity is undeniable it was probably one of the last british sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting goodnight campers
<START> this game is from a genre of games that tried to capitalize off of the whole inspired trend walk around talk to people solve puzzles the puzzles themselves are absolutely horrible but i'll stick to the acting itself which is only slightly better if you're looking for a convincing performance from any one character you won't find it here but this game is worth buying if only to witness the truly hilarious performance of christopher walken his acting is so horrible in this game that it seems like he's imitating someone who happens to be impersonating him he's a caricature of himself br br so buy this game if you're masochistic a walken fan or simply want to hear the f word a lot
<START> the basic idea behind dungeon of harrow isn't all bad the acting however is bad the lighting is bad the music is bad the scenes of torture are without emotion there really isn't much there to recommend this film you know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say special guest star and list someone you've never heard of might as well say rex hamilton as abraham lincoln because there's really no one in this movie you can identify there are one or two decent moments mostly toward the end and i think the basic plot outline may have contained an original idea but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise inept yawner
<START> i must say i was surprised to find several positive comments to this turkey in desperate need of a feather transplant i'm giving it a 1 because i think the idea of making a movie about the wild man of rock'n'roll jerry lee lewis is honorable but it's a shame to put out such trash and the killer does not deserve this it's a good thing it came late in his career they said elvis practically ruined his career with the movies he put out through the sixties and this could have done the same for jerry lee had it come out some 15 20 years earlier it's based on myra gail lewis book and that's a shame to begin with it's a bad and inaccurate story of her life together with lewis and there is far better books about the killer that could have made a much better and more interesting script add to this a bunch of actors who doesn't know if they are participating in a drama comedy or a little bit of both the otherwise fine actor dennis quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many a moon he is walking around in the picture talking about his god given talent and as a spectator you wish he'd show some of it on the screen too silly gestures and funny faces and jerry lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this truly awful movie the rest of the crew is almost as bad save for winona ryder who does her best with the crappy lines given to her it's grease all over again and whenever jerry lee take a ride around memphis in his convertible having the radio on in the car the whole town is dancing to the music from it everybody in this movie are like cartoon figures of the real people involved from the wild man himself to sun records sam philips and it's a damn shame a charismatic and interesting artist like jerry lee lewis deserves better and i hope he took the 500 000 dollars he got from the deal and told the company to go f k themselves twice
<START> alexander nevsky is a series of superb sequences of cinematic opera that pass from pastoral to and end in a the story takes place in prince alexander nevsky nikolai defeats the teutonic knights in a battle on the ice of lake br br the film is a splendid historical pageant which shows director sergei eisenstein at his most inventively pictorial and climaxes in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds several films have scenes strongly influenced by the battle of lake including doctor zhivago 1965 mulan 1998 and king arthur 2004 alexander nevsky was kept out of circulation due to changing political winds and then enshrined as perhaps the most influential soviet made historical film
<START> although compared with mad max this film is in a league of its own set in post apocalyptic paris this film is about man's struggle for survival he has lost his ability to speak and there is a remarkable shortage of women congratulations luc
<START> when i started watching surface for the first time i was hooked it had everything i wanted in a show suspense action mystery great plot and a great cast of characters my whole family loved to watch the show it seems when there's a great show on tv the network usually cancels it like they seemed to do with this show they go by the nielson rating system which i think is stupid because there is a lot of junk that they seem to watch which the networks keep on the air if only there was a way for everyone to vote on a show then maybe the good shows won't get canceled when i watch tv now i only watch good shows so right now thats not watching a whole lot of tv i hope that the network brings the show back but when they make up there mind with a dumb decision they seem to stick to it i hope there's a lot of people out there that feel the same way
<START> this film is great all the hi tech machinery and technology is mind boggling it is packed with action humour and not to mention guys you will want to see it again and again very very funny also it has a very unique plot which is unpredictable you wouldn't want to miss out on it
