<START> this is a total piece of crap it is an insult to the awesome book by frank herbert they have mangled the story and characters the acting is average to bad the only character done right and played well is duke leto played by william hurt unfortunately he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there not that its a very tall hill to begin with br br the 1984 movie was directed by the legendary david lynch i was not overly impressed with the movie but considering the technological limitations of the time they tried their best amazingly the crappy mini series makes it look so much better by comparison it was at least somewhat true to the book which i really love br br they had the chance to do it right this time sadly it was not taken
<START> i saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper sometimes i can get into intellectual romantic movies this movie just did not move me i felt like it was about one hour too long camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor who loses just about everything i thought the whole movie was just sad and downcast if you like tragedies you might like this i just thought it was too long which meant it has many unnecessary scenes which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom i would not recommend this movie if you want to see a good romantic tragedy go watch titanic
<START> a severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing guy rolfe so fantastic as andre toulon in part three barely features this time and richard band's fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film for the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of bodega bay inn gordon currie and some youth friends of his many of the cast are canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles teresa hill is quite yummy totems minions of the egyptian god want the secret of animation life back and the puppets when they surface act with a previously unseen cleverness to attempt to destroy the ugly and very computer game looking totems the totems merely complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique they don't share the weird beauty of the puppets and thus don't really fit in top scene is pinhead using a rag to clean blood from drill bit classic and about the goriest this film goes the fifth film was filmed concurrently with this one so expect similar sections of mediocre and a toulon performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era or even galaxy guy rolfe deserved better and series fans certainly do
<START> i was watching the perfect storm and thought about another wolfgang peterson film which is much better this one although certainly not based on a true story in the line of fire is how a movie should be made it has a terrific story with a great cast malkovich won a well deserved oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served all too well eastwood is good as the tortured secret service and russo is easy on the eyes if you haven't seen this definitely rent it or buy it as i did definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade 9 10
<START> the best movie about friendship especially between an aids infected person and a normal person this is a great movie for everyone to see even though there is strong language used i have seen it 25 times
<START> i generally won't review movies i haven't seen in awhile so i'll pop them in or rent them to give a full and fresh take on the film in the case of 'a sound of thunder ' i remembered my vow of never seeing this movie ever again so i'll just go on memory in fact i haven't thought of how badly made this movie was until i read someone else's review and remembered the experience i had back in 2005 when i actually saw this in the theater my movie buddy forced me to see it though i wasn't interested and wow later on i forced him to see 'basic instinct 2' in the theater reminding him he made me see this crap so i guess that made us even i certainly had my share of deep laughs at the movie's expense of course which didn't make him happy as he really wanted to see it the time travel butterfly effect film had so many bad graphics the loudest chuckles from me was whenever they showed the dinosaur god i loved seeing that dino and them actually being scared of it Â it was hilarious or just simply ben kingsley it's great kingsley can remind us on how human actors can be going from 'gandhi' and 'schindler's list' to uh this even a meryl streep can do a 'she devil' from time to time so they're forgiven for months i pulled an mst3k with my buddy consistently referencing this movie to any low rent sci fi film or kingsley flick yes the movie would be a great movie to see drunk or otherwise inebriated horrible over the top acting special fx that even the would turn away and ridiculous plot twists the biggest disappointment was that the razzies didn't even nominate this film for any award
<START> this movie is like happiness meets lost in translation with a sixth sense ending or maybe a crying game surprise and the best soundtrack i've probably ever heard if that all make sense br br the first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you're in for a twisted ride i was surprised no one walked out right away during the brooklyn premiere but from there the film settles down into a talk fest between two really damaged people daphne and buddy br br they're lonely mess up and boy do they talk about sex daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting some are quite funny mr chang some disturbing the harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be what's going on or what daphne is really feeling and because i have a friend who used to escort i might add most seem quite real br br you are alone is multi layered and mostly brilliant okay maybe a couple minutes less of the talking and i don't know that we'd have missed anything br br then again i need to see it again knowing the ending br br i like this movie br br the director asked people in the brooklyn audience to write a review on imdb because a lot of people read them request granted
<START> i really liked this film about love between two adults in postwar britain the high standards of bbc tv is evident in the production and superb lead actors claire bloom and joss ackland make this an uplifting experience bloom and ackland have previously worked together in theatre and their chemistry and interaction is splendid i recommend this version of shadowlands over the film version of 1993
<START> this is just about one of the dumbest things i've ever seen maybe not a worst movie ever contender but if you haven't seen that many bad ones this could easily make your top ten worst list when you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original king kong you've got to ask yourself why anyone would stoop so low as to produce this debacle then taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to star wars the following year achieved a new level in sci fi entertainment this offering will make you laugh and cry at the same time br br now let me ask you what would possess the professor peter cushing to bring along an umbrella as a prime piece of subterranean research equipment for the ride to the earth's core ok so it was useful in fending off the parrot tyrannosaur in the early going but come on somehow i don't think this is what edgar rice burrough's had in mind when he wrote his tales of he probably didn't have caroline munro in mind either as princess dia probably the only redeeming factor to this whole escapade br br at least there was one bit of pseudo scientific explanation that i got a kick out of i'm always looking for one in films like this that would have to be how the sky at the earth's core was really the underside of the earth's crust explaining that ethereal pinkish glow but try as it might the story just couldn't hook me in a way to find anything at all interesting about the sly one or the ugly one much less those goofy half man half pterodactyl creatures to paraphrase the good professor you cannot mesmerize me i'm paying attention
<START> any batman fan will know just how great the films are they've been a major success batman returns however is by far the best film in the series a combination of excellent directing brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night in br br tim burton who directed this movie has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and he's done a great job danny devito penguin man is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby and grown up to become a hideous and ugly thing michelle plays the sleek and very seducing after cats had given her there genes from being bitten the result in both the character changes is excellent and both catwoman and penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film the mysterious catwoman is great fun to watch her classic sayings and a funny part in which skips with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film danny devito also does well his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he lives br br you can't forget batman though micheal keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance and shows us a different side to batman his affection is let loose when he confronts catwoman at the end of the film and his meetings with her when she's a normal person selina kyle result in him being seduced badly in his own home there's a clever part after this when they leave and the film is full of great scenes its worth noting that bruce wayne's bat mobile is not used as much as in the other batman films as close combat and story telling scenes make up this film br br the winter setting is created perfectly in gotham city with most of the scenes being set at night and with the town being filled with snow therefore if you watch this film during the summer like i have it doesn't feel the same best watch it during the winter br br overall its an amazing movie all the credit goes to tom burton and the cast they've done an incredible job
<START> i remember seeing the trailer for this film and i absolutely knew i had to see this movie it looked like something that would be right up my alley br br the united states of leland is a terrific movie it is not one that will leave you with a nice pleasant ending but with a sad empty feeling instead and when i say it will leave you with an empty feeling i do not mean that as a bad thing i believe that you are meant to fill that empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and human's general motives and how they act as parts of society br br ryan gosling is perfectly cast as leland he is intelligent yet stoic i like the way that he narrates the film with his journal the supporting cast is terrific as well kevin spacey is very good as always and don cheadle is amazing as teacher and mentor br br this was a great story and is very smart and thought provoking i highly recommend it
<START> i bought this a while back during a massive martial arts movie phase although this certainly ain't the best i do love this kind of film making and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one leung kar yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars i always appreciate the fact that whilst he lacked formal martial arts training he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance he also has a good beard this movie has him in a good heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies he still acquits himself well early appearances from cherie chung and chow yun fat are also nice too see especially for the fact that chow yun fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play he may not be a great fighter but he does ok eddy ko is as great a bad guy as ever he performs the same as in many of his other films and does it great as per usual the fellow who plays bu is good too i don't recall his name but he's in magnificent butcher too although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era the postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance there are some very nifty scenes good characters and a good eclectic mixture of hong kong talents all coming together to decent effect all in all i would recommend this to kung fu and general hong kong action fans it may not be a stylised classic like the shaw brothers films or as crowd pleasing as jackie chan or bruce lee but it is rock solid entertainment
<START> a film comes along that manages to be absolutely terrible from the opening titles on through to the studio logo tagged at the end of the closing credits this was such a film the very type you can not stop watching for fear of missing a moment of its ever descending quality br br forget the low budget that's indicated by a slow monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a presidential with no crowds no traffic or location discernible forget the jumbled logic needed to even remotely make the actual plot seem plausible forget that roy scheider delivers some of the hammiest dialogue whilst completely failing to hide his shame br br this clunker is terribly paced bombarded by a score that's simply laughable and seems edited by a third grader all the while twisting scenarios to cover up the hardest thing about filming a presidential storyline on the cheap making him seem presidential br br i honestly feel asleep briefly in the last reel and when i awoke i ran it back so as not to miss a single excruciating frame try this drinking game take a shot every time you see it blatantly aping another much better film you'll doze off too br br not since 'the man' w samuel l jackson and eugene levy have i seen such a delightfully unredeemable project i may give out copies as christmas gifts zero stars a thousand laughs
<START> i am still not sure what the hell this movie is about i guess the boy was afraid of becoming blind and began imagining all sorts of strange things this does not explain why he wanted to kill his new baby brother however or the unrelenting boredom found within this film while watching this movie you will wish you were blind so you did not have to see this experiment in futility skip this steaming pile and opt for anything else at the video store anything else
<START> when i saw this movie three years ago i thought it exemplified a lot of the traits found in singapore art house movies slow moving with a minimal of plot and dialogue depending on film composition to make it work br br during then amongst local cineastes the inability to appreciate be with me is tantamount to panning citizen kane or any of ozu's late films i've no idea how be with me reached such hallowed heights in cinematic consciousness but i always felt that 12 is a better film even though the latter film does not boast as good a cinematographer as adrian tan dp for be with me 12 has a story that better relates to most singaporeans and has bite too something that be with me 's threadbare wistfulness doesn't have br br be with me is basically a barely interlinked trio of narratives strung together into a film by and his screenwriter wong kim it deals with a security guard who falls in love with a girl whom he only sees in the distance two girls in a relationship and the story of deaf and blind teresa chan br br be with me is very well filmed by tan using a camera the film compositions are masterful the film almost entirely silent has next to no dialogue characters move around not in a realistic manner but almost as if they are models under the instruction of a director almost always looking into the screen and emoting either loneliness or sadness unfortunately the characters don't act against each other this kind of film has been seen before many times in tsai ming liang's films in protÃ©gÃ© royston 4 30 and elsewhere sadly its ultra slowness essentially plot less and use of a piano soundtrack simply doesn't appeal to me br br to criticize be with me seems almost to negate the inspirational story behind it that of teresa chan who is blind and deaf and yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this yet i'm afraid this film doesn't do anything much to me i'm willing to applaud chan's steadfast and courageous march in life and striking cinematography but for a better take on the same subject matter with more meat without the two other tedious and distracting subplots try werner herzog's land of silence and darkness 1971
