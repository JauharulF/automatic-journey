<START> i am not understanding why people are praising this movie i didn't like it at all i watch it with several people none of them cared for it either first of all it is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story the actual filming looks like a live tv interview the makeup is bad when you watch the movie along with the dvd extras you will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it there is no talent there are facts that do appear in the book the facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and skits added to it i have read several books and have watched several shows on this story what i have always caught from all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story i really wish someone could really do a good film on this one it has always fascinated me the bad acting really ruined the story the little boys situation really hammed it up even more when you watch this movie the little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about it didn't make any sense why his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him it was like the witch was supposed to be so threatening but it was ok to throw baby brother to her it is a whopping tale with him and his little problem i can't still get over the little girl saying mom said tobacco will rot your teeth frank fox's statement and facial expression is so bad the scene out in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid to the sound from parts of it seems to be from the movie psycho also the girl hovering over the bed and her little bladder control problem are from the exorcist this movie is lacking from the talent of creativity we put the movie in for a couple of minutes and knew right away it was a bummer i also noticed that their was defects in the film quality parts of it looked like what a person might film on a home video camera i noticed a lot of the people in the credits had many multiple jobs this is probably how this movie was put together someone said i like this story i will get all my friends and make a movie about with a video camera and a computer doesn't matter if we don't know how to act as long as we get it on film and say it is good we got the family together and prepared food then sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie
<START> what were they thinking when they made this truly terrible film br br arbus one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century had a fascinating and dramatic life what possessed anyone to make this film which explains her unique artistic vision as being the result of an imaginary affair with a grotesque yet charismatic hairy freak played by downey br br in real life arbus broke out of a traditional marriage and woman's role to express herself in this movie arbus is an ultra dreary nicole kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to a beauty and the beast devotion to an interesting man br br for this reinvention the film is truly shameful independent of that it is also just dopey and dull
<START> an on screen caption informs us that it is 'the caribbean sea may a small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship and the ship's doctor a lt claude de ross claudio cassinelli it's night a strange current takes the boat towards a strange unnamed and uncharted island the boat hits some rocks and is torn apart one of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish man creature the next morning morning claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach he finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it claude warns another surviving prisoner jose franco not to drink the water as it will kill him they both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners peter roberto posse francois francesco and skip giuseppe francois wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food he finds and kills a large water bird but in turn he is killed himself by one of the fish men claude jose peter and skip continue to explore the island as they put death down to an animal attack of some sort soon after skip is killed when he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit now only claude jose and peter are left they stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals claude spots a snake on a nearby rock suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes a woman on horseback named amanda marvin barbara bach is revealed to be saviour she tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a edmund richard johnson and he doesn't like visitors claude jose and peter decide to carry on regardless eventually finding rackham's large house in which they are invited to stay that night peter goes after amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp peter quickly becomes food for the fish men and a voodoo priestess called beryl cunningham who lives with performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery the next day claude and jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about and think he is lying to them jose rides off on horseback and is lost claude is saved from one of the fish men by amanda and is again told to leave claude wants to confront again reveals that he has a scientist and amanda's father named professor ernest marvin joseph cotten who he needs to be kept alive says that the longer ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase tells claude his plan has found the lost city of atlantis at a depth of over 2 000 feet he is using the fish men as a means of getting at the lost treasures of atlantis and needs amanda and her father to control them he claims the fish men are descendants of the original inhabitants of atlantis offers claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep ernest alive later claude remembers the name ernest marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings finding ernest's secret laboratory he discovers had lied to him and the fish men aren't descendants their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by ernest's grotesque experiments has finally had enough of claude and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere wants to leave the island with his treasures and amanda will claude escape almost certain death to save amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart directed by sergio martino i really liked this film that mixes various genres the script by sergio donati is fast paced interesting and entertaining the plot is revealed bit by bit which kept me interested in watching it all the way through i must say at this point that i've seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it's us release by roger corman barbara bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady but i hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off i thought it was more than a little distasteful richard johnson makes a great villain and claudio cassinelli a likable hero the fish men themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and i've seen worse some of the miniature effects look a little poor too but overall again i've again seen a lot worse there's no real gore violence or nudity in it but that didn't really bother me actually the photography by giancarlo and the production design by massimo combine to create a very nice looking film period costumes props and sets like rackham's house and ernest's lab with it's old scientific equipment the lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show i really liked this film and i was entertained throughout it's running time i'm not sure who i'd recommend it too as it mixes various genres i guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made if you can find a copy give it a go i'm glad i did
<START> i loved heavenly creatures and make it a point to catch it whenever it is on br br so imagine my delight when i discovered love suicide while browsing netflix echoing heavenly creatures an easy choice to the top of my queue it went br br i watched it last made myself comfy and waited what i thought was some crappy preview of a stoned high school student's prank film project i laughed out loud once or twice thinking that just lowered the bar of straight to video turned out to be the movie horrible acting amateur direction weak dialog i usually enjoy low budget films there is something tangible and real about them because they cannot afford the superficial stuff to distract from the meat acting the direction the plot the story i would liken it to a student who hasn't studied for an exam goes in knowing he is going to fail and just puts his head on the desk and sleeps br br in someone else's hands the plot would have serious potential br br do not expect magic or even a cult classics like say polyester or showgirls at least there you learn to expect bad acting br br love suicide went from bad to worse to the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> i have recently gone to the movie theatres to see the new 2007 version of bridge to after i went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again i must say that i was extremely disappointed i found the older version to have horrible acting as well as corny lines including jessie saying i know daddy but i hurt so much inside after leslie dies it was quite horribly done and the casting was not much better in my opinion i watched in amazement all the while saying no wonder they remade it the story is great but trust me spend the money and see the new version if you just see the old one you may never experience the true magic of
<START> this film should be seen by as many people as possible as it concentrates on the human rights problems in burma when i first watched this film in the mid 1990's it totally changed my life i knew very little about san or her democracy movement it effected me so i wanted to understand more about the situation any film that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly patricia arquette is superb as the american lady who due to personal tragedy has become reckless with her own life decisions and gets caught up in the ensuing conflict it is a powerful film about a subject matter which deserves more publicity as the film itself says the 1988 massacre of pro democracy activists was not televised and therefore largely went unnoticed to the world i implore everyone reading these comments to take the time to find out more about the current plight of the burmese people br br it is about time this film was released on dvd can anything be done
<START> undercurrent features a top notch cast of wonderful actors who might've been assembled for the perfect drawing room comedy alas they are pretty much wasted on a view' potboiler and a paper thin one at that katharine hepburn is indeed radiant as a tomboy old maid who finally marries but her husband is deeply disturbed and harboring dark family secrets director vincente minnelli has absolutely no idea how to mount this outlandish plot concocted by edward from a story by thelma and the friendly first rate cast including robert taylor robert mitchum and edmund gwenn is left treading in murky waters from
<START> the best thing i can say about the american version is that jane turner and gina reilly must be raking in the money for this crap yes the american rip off was shown for about two episodes in australia but didn't rate probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be answer deplorable a complete waste of time the actors are relatively unknown and they don't take readily to the nuances of the australian written script bad luck for them as they are doomed to plummet with this turkey my advice to usa viewers is don't br br americans should be best advised to find dvd's of the original version on ebay but be aware that some dvds are in a different to those issued in the usa otherwise some dvd players will operate discs from both all zones
<START> those prophetic words were spoken by william holden as a war reporter to the beauteous jennifer jones as a eurasian doctor explaining his failing marriage on the beach they start an affair despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues in hollywood of the 1950s interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end beautiful hong kong scenery although some beach scenes look studio bound a famous title tune poetic script lovely background music by alfred newman great costumes outstanding performances especially jones directed here by henry king who also did the song of bernadette 1943 an oscar for jones still make this a world class romance weeper
<START> i remember that hey hey fuss i saw the jackson jive it was a pretty straight forward comedy skit but i saw this it is free is out in the clear have i missed something if the black community should be complaining about any racist comments in a tv show it should be this if you've read my earlier comments i am not the easy to offend guy the basic plot is that an african american moves in next to this white guy they make these racist comments like the value of a house will drop just because of black neighbours the white guy makes references like if your easily offended by racial slurs do not read on nog jungle boy i apologise but that really happens in this show i really am a guy who is fine with the black community people might say hey lighten up but even when you take the racial away it is un funny no new jokes badly acted i can swear in one episode i saw someone's eyes focus on something unconnected with the situation all in all horrible comedy
<START> had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called half empty i usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest sequel or prequel that hollywood throws at us this was different and surprisingly Â so much more entertaining than anything hollywood spends millions advertising when my husband and i go the movies we go to be entertained Â and half empty did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it it is a funny human and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly entertains in its simplicity i especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom it is almost like an operetta that particular scene reminded me of a scene in phantom of the opera when 4 of the performers did not just i e they sang against one another in a friendly retort i am not a film maven but this film was more enjoyable than any other major studio film i have seen lately it is silly funny entertaining and amusing completely enjoyable Â which is what i expect from movies but rarely do they deliver like half empty
<START> thank goodness not all dutch people are that ruthless i think jason is being judged like that by most people simply because he has a famous father maybe he's not as great as some of those actors but he's definitely not as bad as suggested br br i watched the movie some years ago and i actually loved it i knew jason from other movies and of course robin of sherwood but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on it was really good br br during the movie i actually forgot he was the son of sean who br br and if you're a shakespeare lover i can recommend this movie i'm sure you'll enjoy it
<START> i mean let's face it all you have to do in modelling is pose for photos the judging is so over the top with it's criticism the show however is entertaining especially with tyra banks nigel barker j alexander and the supermodel herself twiggy i've watched season 5 6 7 and in the middle of season 8 it looks like american idol gone sexy but i'm a guy and i only watch it because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis the show can be quite boring when it comes to judging tyra tends to go on and on and it's really off putting anyway would i recommend it yes would i recommend it to women wanting to go into the modelling business no
<START> being a fan of the game and watching this film made me physically vomit br br it was an awful film though the story was similar to the games plot the whole super human soldiers thing other than that jack carver an all american man in the game is played by a unless thats some sort of twisted irony that is what made me pull a middle finger at my tv screen the second it started the fact that you can tell its filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed like the middle of summer this is uncalled for because the game is set in the tropical rain forest whereas this looks like the director just looked out his window in the morning and went thats a good forest br br this is a note to all directors if you ever plan to make a film based on a game book play it understand it and ask fans about it don't just play it for an hour and assume you know it
