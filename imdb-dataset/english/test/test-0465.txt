<START> it is a truism that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie this one is no exception br br i am no lover of yanks but their amazingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything to black and white as well as make events even fictional ones in novels fit an agenda that bears little or no relationship to complexity of any kind is irritating in the extreme br br wilbur smith is verbose but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than has been delivered by this awful mishmash of a movie br br sad really for those who will never read smith they will be left with a less than decent portrayal of his egyptian series which has to be said is gigantic in its exposition br br the indiana jones movies were snappy to attempt to replicate that by manipulating smith's novels into this production misses out by a country mile br br pathetic except for the photography and art malik
<START> life was going great for new york city advertising artist ted kramer he had a great job and a loving wife no actually his wife wasn't so loving for when ted returned home late from work that night his wife joanna had a suit case packed and was heading out the door he tried to stop her but she just got into the elevator and out of ted's life well now in addition to his job he's now got to mind the house as well as their 6 year old son billy ted assured his boss that his wife's leaving would not affect his job performance in any way it did however affect his performance as a father he blew up when billy spilled punch on his client artwork well some time later ted and billy receive a letter from joanna and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn't coming back ted was distraught well he was late coming home from work on billy's birthday which made billy sore at him br br ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting when he got home he yelled at billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner then later he truthfully told billy that the break up between he and joanna may have been his fault not billy's ted invited a good friend phyllis bernard over that night and well billy got his first look at a naked woman when ted took billy to the park the following day he fell off the jungle gym and landed face first onto his toy plane ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches after that life began taking a downward spiral for ted then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than joanna they met in a corner cafÃ© at first they have a pleasant conversation but then joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her ted would have none of it and stormed out well life got even worse for ted when his boss jim o'connor took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him not only that but joanna was choosing to sue for custody of billy and without a job ted didn't stand a chance in hell for winning he hired himself a lawyer john who charged a pretty penny 15 000 exact change and that's if they win br br ted was also able to find a new job it was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination finally the court date january 9 1980 arrived judge atkins presiding joanna took the stand and proceeded to question her about why she left ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures the next day ted took the stand and lawyer really grilled him like a ted's good friend margaret took the stand as well and she really didn't help matters well the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough one day informs ted that he lost joanna got sole custody of billy how typical always ruling in favor of the mother well ted and billy were just devastated about parting ways they had a tearful goodbye when suddenly joanna stopped by she and ted have a little talk and well rather than just give away the ending let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody br br this was a very good movie dustin hoffman was very good he earned that academy award i've also seen him in hook meet the and rain man which he also won an oscar for meryl streep was good she also got an oscar justin henry was good too so where was his nomination i guess the academy had a rule against giving oscars to children but the rule was lifted when haley joel osment came along this movie has great drama light comedy and is very subtle it does a good job of holding your attention i was watching rain man on tcm the other night then this came on after and i just couldn't help but watch and that's what you should do if you like dustin hoffman or meryl streep or movies of this genre then i recommend kramer vs kramer a gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child i liked ted's little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time what was it about sex that makes a good parents actually that's how they have the child but seriously he's right why always rule in favor of the mother because she's a woman also in the cast george coe howard duff who passed away in 1990 and howland chamberlain who passed away in 1984 watch for an up and coming jobeth williams in the nudity in the hallway scene anyway see kramer vs kramer today good movie br br
<START> shopping sunny skies beaches boarding school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings welcome to the life of zoey brooks and her friends zoey brooks is portrayed by jamie lynn spears the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star britney spears with her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent it's confirmed that nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism when kristin the actress who portrayed dana cruz in the first season left the show all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress the female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media if they continue to pursue jamie lynn spears as the picture of perfection very many people will have to lower their standards with hope they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing jamie lynn spears is useless for acting singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career there is no wondering why she is a self proclaimed actress critics would most definitely proclaim her as something other than that
<START> ok small town clueless sheriff check sheriff's hot daughter check ne'er do well boyfriend of sheriff's hot daughter whom sheriff hates check corporate land developer who puts profit over people check developer's rank and file accidentally unleashing a primordial monster then being pressured to cover it up check natives warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned back to the way they were check amateurish cgi special effects that could have been produced by a commodore 64 computer check seriously virtually all the clichÃ©s of your typical sci fi original movie have been lumped into a classic so bad it's good movie the only one that's missing is the scientist expert trying to impart his knowledge there is a paleontologist with three students who get ambushed my the bone eater fairly early in the movie but they are basically extras in the movie and i can honestly say that i predicted virtually all of this right down to who survives and who doesn't though i have to say i got the actual death time of one of the characters wrong by about an hour i swear i could have done this movie myself if they gave me all the characters despite all this the movie is fun to watch if for no other reason than to play mst3k with your friends if you're up for some mindless fun it's a great movie to watch which is why i give this movie a surprisingly respectable 4 even though for all intents and purposes it deserves a much much lower rating but then again you wouldn't tune in to a scifi original movie if you were looking for a movie with an actual plot substantive characters or good special effects would you
<START> this is a crummy film a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies and a genre that has been done so much better before the plot limps along with a predictable ending yawn the characters are unlikeable and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable matt dillon a fine intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered the others are forgettable much of the dialog is sophomoric again a pretender trying to be witty i wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list yes it's that bad veering from misogynistic to just plain gross as in beyond frat house gross with so much real talent out there i'm really surprised this movie ever got made it shows the total lack of imagination of the office suits
<START> i rented this film from because of the cover and title sounded intriguing this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense the monsters needed more face time we needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more oh sh moments the photography didn't bother me except for the scene where a re breather blows up there were too many close ups but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom overall i would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers but this movie is definitely a below average rent br br there are definitely better picks i would recommend 1 or 2 over this pick
<START> roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patent and sell immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car and he gets some roommates in to help pay the rent and gets a job then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous br br 88 minutes none of these details of the plot are explored in any detail what you read above is more or less as interesting as the film will be when his uncle dies there are some breasts on screen one of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty funny for about 40 seconds the ending is literally the worst i've ever seen i want the other 87 minutes of my life back br br i hadn't thought anyone could make a movie with so little merit surely there are rules against this sort of thing getting to the public the script can't be longer than twenty pages and the budget must have been minuscule because the whole film has about 3 locations and a car the only conceivable use for roomies in my opinion is if you're holding someone hostage and want to frustrate them beyond human thought if so get it on repeat and you'll have a ready made gibbering wreck within the day br br one and a half out of 10
<START> mixed group of experts explorers divers and scientists venture a mile underground and go another 2 4 miles underwater to a spot even more remote where they find giant albino moles and some big razor fanged winged computer generated creatures lurking about the cave is sealed off by a and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit and that's all she wrote with this low aiming effort that even fails to combine action science fiction and horror on the most elementary of levels imagine if someone gave the folks at the sci fi channel 30 million dollars to make a monster movie that's precisely what the cave is like almost startling in its ineptitude at times full of clichÃ©s and almost entirely dependent on the special effects to entertain the only difference is they had more money to build sets more money to polish up the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who give awful performances anyway otherwise it's business as usual some of these movies are still fun to watch this one is not and there are loads of reasons why br br 1 it takes itself far too seriously and has no sense of humor whatsoever so you get a completely unoriginal and predictable movie that doesn't even recognize how unoriginal and predictable it is br br 2 the opening sequence serves no purpose whatsoever other than killing a few minutes and adding to the redundancy br br 3 unoriginal looking cgi creatures are not impressing anyone in this day and age br br 4 utilizing shakycam and quick cut editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy unimaginative film making and why further obscure the action by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions such as fire and explosion of bubbles it makes these scenes not only difficult to see but also impossible to enjoy even on a no brainer action level br br 5 even though it wants you take to it seriously the script is full of clichÃ©s the dialogue is awful and there's no attempt whatsoever at characterization casting 25 year old looking model types in roles as brilliant scientists and gruff veteran explorers might provide some eye candy but it completely kills the credibility of a movie that otherwise plays out completely straight sorry you can't have it both ways br br 6 there were two exceptions to the model rule as they did decide to cast an old guy and an average looking joe these were the first two characters killed off br br 7 for a little diversity they also squeezed in a black guy and a chinese guy strangely neither are given much of a voice in this film and basically stand in the background as whitey discusses what their next move will be insulting br br 8 furthermore how many movies have to be made where a black character sacrifices his life at the very end just to ensure hot white female lead and hot white male lead end up together at the end ugh give me a break already br br 9 much of the acting was horrible cole hauser's performance was completely laughable the other male lead looked like he just walked off the set of a soap opera and coasted by using the patented dimpled smile makes all the ladies swoon technique which is the pg 13 gender switch equivalent to my large breasts make all the guys swoon technique often used by ladies in r rated films either way his performance was completely phoned in daniel kim from the tv series lost and piper perabo also stunk up the room with their stilted and monotone line delivery br br 10 was the ending a joke absolutely terrible please god we do not need a sequel to this garbage br br so basically i wouldn't bother with this one unless you've never seen a monster movie before or if you're just really desperate and the only other thing on is the simple life the sets were good the blue tinted photography is ok and a few of the actors lena headey marcel tried their best so i decided to boost the rating up one notch to a 2
<START> looking back on the year 2006 one of the things i will remember most is the on the internet for a film called snakes on a plane but unknown to me there was a straight to dvd rip off film called snakes on a train after seeing this i feel its at best a below par b movie br br the plot br br a husband and wife get on a train to go to los angles to get help form the husbands uncle who is a shaman this is because the wife's family do not approve of her marring him so they have put a curse on her that snakes will become her thought with a sixteen hour drive to los angles and a group of passengers the include an ex narc cop and some drug traffickers will they get there in time before the snakes take her over br br view on the film first the effects i have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a gory way the main effect shots you have to wait eighty minutes to see are sadly that bad that they completely kill any good memories of the film the film makes video games look like t2 next to this one of the things i noticed is that there is no screenplay credit on the film and the directors make the film so anti climatic it ruins the whole film final view on the film br br a below par b movie with an unbelievably bad ending

<START> i don't particularly care from michael jackson aside from being a pedophile i really do not like his music with the exceptions of a few songs from his landmark album thriller this is one of them i do like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made br br this was directed by john landis best known to horror fans as the director of an american werewolf in london this music video is not so much a music video but more or less a short horror film m j and his date are at a werewolf movie when they leave the movie they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies when michael jackson does his famous thriller dance br br you know this actually is a pretty good song with good synthesized beats this and beat it are probably the only two michael jackson songs i can tolerate over and over i especially love vincent price's cameo as the narrator his distinctive voice is perfect for a horror themed music video even if you don't like m j 's music you need to see this video at least once by the way he was good before becoming a creepy white woman with a fake nose
<START> wesley snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess horribly reminiscent of steven seagal's latest works the script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good sadly too snipes has fallen into the trap of having an adr voice double doing much of his dialogue and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie it's sad to see a guy of wesley snipes talent doing garbage like this film and producing a tired and clearly bored performance barely bothered to produce his own dialogue it's become somewhat of a joke with steven seagal the fact he doesn't perform his own dialogue but it's not something i'd have expected from snipes perhaps it's due to the producer andrew stevens who has worked with seagal previously or the director po chi leong responsible for seagal's epically bad out of reach br br the plot involves shady government officials terrorists who coach soccer teams disks with incriminating evidence on and a hefty chuck of missing money oh and biological weapons now how they are connected i don't know but what i can tell you is the diabolical script is pretty hard to fathom and like many of these dtv movies this likes to include one twist too many the plot is also told playing out it's cards with people having shady one to ones in offices and dark alleys etc it's all kind of lets have a sit down and dish out some plot points for the sad bastards watching this film the pace of the movie as such suffers because despite the dullness of the performances and the storyline the film does have some nice action scenes as an example of how a dtv film has successfully put across a storyline of a twisting nature i give you dolph lundgren's directorial debut the defender that movie had it's share of twists and over complexity but the movie has a last hour of almost entirely action with dolph under siege form terrorists the plot points are told in the context of action on the move while avoiding death the movie doesn't stop to tell us what's happening it doesn't break up the pace as such although the plot was a little convoluted it was more forgivable cause the action never let up the detonator like too many of these films stops everything to give us a convoluted walk through of who's bad and who isn't before inevitably shifting that round in the pulled from the rear end twist at the end these movies can often suffer with pacing issues br br snipes himself as i mentioned is pretty bland here at the beginning he's putting on a camp persona as he's undercover with some arms dealers initially it seemed as if he was enjoying himself but unfortunately the rest of the movie sees him and his occasional voice double sleepwalking through the role snipes only comes alive when he's called upon to kick ass there's some nice action here though with some swift and crunching martial arts and some nicely punchy shootouts the film also features a decent car chase silvia co star and she's not much of an actress but she is gorgeous with a costume that screams look at my cleavage the rest of the cast flit in and out with clichÃ©d and uninteresting roles br br snipes thankfully has better projects lined up from now he has another team up with mario van peebles called hard luck then he will do chasing the dragon from the director chris who did jet li's kiss of the dragon finally snipes is apparently doing toussaint a biographical drama directed by danny glover the future is suddenly looking brighter for snipes but lets remember he was getting extremely well paid for his dtv films around a movie possibly more it's also funny to consider that of all these dtv god's dolph lundgren is doing the better films directing himself with the enjoyable defender and the supremely violent and nicely done the russian specialist and what's more he's doing them on a fraction of the budgets of these diabolical offerings from wesley and steven seagal are producing 1 2
<START> if you're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie bad in the way only ken russell at his worst can be you must try this one it succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a 25 porn booth and you can just about smell the urine on the floor kathleen turner struts around in a blond wig getting her kicks from pretending to be a two bit hooker she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect and tony perkins plays a hysterical priest who is out to maybe murderer her yet another movie that ends with tony perkins in drag annie potts shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit which is reason enough to hate this movie the kinky will love the sex scenes so rent the unrated version in the red box so you can see turner give a cop a taste of his billy club i had to pause the vcr until we stopped laughing
<START> contains spoilers br br as a fan of rachael leigh cook i watched for this show to finally come on so that i could see it i taped it so i could watch it several times and there is something about this show that really bothers me br br i recognize that this was a made for tv movie not only that but it was made for lifetime which is a channel that i despise because it was made for tv i can ignore the huge plot holes i can ignore the massive lack of character development in ally sheedy's character i can overlook the fact that george c scott and rachael leigh cook both of whom are very talented actors were definately not reaching the best of their abilities i can look past the fact that don character was so cliche'd that you knew when you saw him he was the villain i can even pass over the obvious mistake in the timeline she's raped during her winter break and then over a year later she has the baby from it br br the major thing that i can't get over is this there are two trials for the custody of the child in the first trial custody is awarded to the child's father because he is better educated has a degree from a community college and has a full time job in the second trial the judgement is reversed because the judge feels that there is lack of evidence that emma character is an unfit mother and custody shouldn't be taken from the primary caretaker and given to someone with no previous interaction with the child br br the problem is this nowhere during the course of these trials is the fact that a year old man raped a 15 year old girl and got her pregnant taken into consideration whether it was a rape or not he had sex with a minor wouldn't that be taken into consideration when the judge is choosing him for custody because he's a mature adult mature adults don't have sex with minors br br it's not the worst cable movie that you would ever see but it's not a great show either out of
<START> miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 70s and it's only been recently that his movies have made it american shores via disney and fans fawning over his great talent is no exception although some of his other movies have been a bit more accessible to us audiences some may find this one a bit on the fence being sort of japanese in its presentation for the same reason pom is very japanese and doesn't make much sense to us audiences so too are some elements of this should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth hope and friendship br br what does come across well is miyazaki's very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy that coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters he steps out of his zone a bit with as the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mom while his dad is away at work on the high seas although not lonely is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and allure of the sea similar to spirited away we see the different worlds of the humans and the sea creatures and i feel that miyazaki may be trying to draw the viewers attention to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live beneath the sea and our acceptance of them and thing that are different br br i managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot miyazaki has claimed that this is my last movie for many years but shortly after spirited away he gave us howl's moving castle is certainly proof that miyazaki has not hung up his spurs and continues to delight and pioneer the most creative animated movies of all time watch with an open mind and a tip of the hat to childhood fantasy and imagination and you'll be transported back to when catching fireflies and secret hiding places were more important than boring grown up stuff and eating your vegetables
