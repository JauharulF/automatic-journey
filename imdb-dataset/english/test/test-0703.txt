<START> a documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called the br br from the looks of it the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular these last few months even one that's going to be released next week paranormal activity however unlike movies like cloverfield rec and blair witch where most of those movies are in complete chaos and mayhem with all of the shakiness this one is basically shown in a traditional documentary style it has tv excerpts and interviews and the scares are very subtle well excluding the last 20 minutes where we go into the chaos effect and where the fear factor is raised up tremendously br br and it works the film is very engrossing and it makes you think yes you heard me right it makes you think you have to pay attention to those unrelated details given throughout the film and the payoff is great when in course of the film these things start to intertwine one another the film is also very slow moving which in this case is a good thing we as the audience get to absorb the details shown on screen however subtle or blatant they are br br above all it's a frightening little film i'm a person who is scared of ghosts and the paranormal more than killers who slashes away teenage victims so yes the film gave me some nightmares there are some images in here that are really disturbing to watch including one closer in the end where it makes you go what am i looking at well it's better left unanswered there are around ten reoccurring characters in here all of which gave authentic performances in their roles br br the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending because most questions are left unanswered the question that's it went though my mind it left a bad taste in my mouth however the rest of the film is just engrossing and really frightening don't see this alone in the dark because you'll regret that choice also i can see in a couple of years that hollywood would remake this film that will be interesting
<START> surprised to know that the director sebastian was a young venezuelan 28 and bored with so many predictable movies i was delighted with the script showing so many small stories and cues spread here and there directed with black humor and taste i loved the tension between the very rickman and the very natural but beautiful thompson each member of the gang deserves attention gil bellows at his best is remarkable
<START> the film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked it looks like the only winning bet for portuguese filmmakers is to include some if not a lot of nudity of the local stars together with slang which otherwise in the nowadays portuguese society is repulsed with horror if you watch advertising for portuguese films at portuguese tvs they all have included a hot scene from the movie i'm not saying by any means that portuguese society is alienated just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success going back to the movie there is nothing left from the spirit of the book which is a masterpiece the film could have been a good one had there been emphasized the real idea of the book of actuality at any time and not the strictly erotic part it had almost all the ingredients but the chef was awful
<START> when going to see rendition i was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big name actors i was not expecting a film that was so engrossing exciting poetic and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and didn't let me go even after i left the theater a word of advice to anyone who hasn't seen it yet don't let your politics come in the way of enjoying or not enjoying this film take it for what it is i saw this with my conservative jewish family i'm the black sheep the pseudo liberal college student and i thought they would write it off as liberal propaganda instead they said it was a great film with excellent performances they like to fancy themselves film critics br br it's sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its oscar affiliated actors while leaving out the constantly underrated sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent the entire cast gave good performances with some standing out much more than others my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which didn't allow for much screen time for each of the characters in fact i felt like the sub plot with and was just as prominent on screen as part of the story br br the characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have streep is truly terrific as a heartless senator and as much as i don't want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her gyllenhaal who will probably be one of the oscar nods for this movie seems a bit unsure in his role at times h's trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he doesn't know how he should feel sarsgaard gave an excellent performance his unforgettable confrontation with streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie again was terrific and i hope to see him in more mainstream films it's a shame that gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him as shown on imdb has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes he along with mohammed and all gave great performances br br the story of and was not given any credit in commercials but it brings a sad humanity to the story the narrative was interesting as i was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end i've read some comments on here that say the love story was useless but i disagree i think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general was the real terrorist but he was doing it to avenge his brother and even though he is responsible for the attack you see a humane side to him through the story with not that i think we should feel bad for actual terrorists but i think the we are all people theme was definitely relevant br br whatever your feelings on terrorism politics etc leave it out of the theater the bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear
<START> examination of the lives of three idling constantly complaining single ex geishas in post war japan is a wonderful character piece they used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful and the other two owe her although the is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy she is the only one of the three that has no children the other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income because neither of them work complications ensue when the kids decide to get married though not to each other and leave home this leads to the bitter grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the meanwhile the is herself unhappy despite her fortunes she has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere all they really want is to borrow money from her the three characters are all neck deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or at the very most toss complaints back and forth to each other br br late is very slow moving and not much actually happens but like all great directors has the ability to do much with very little i haven't seen much of his work but i suspect that this isn't his best even though it is very good the problem i think is that it all doesn't seem to amount to much but the film is full of good points although it is cynical it isn't overly so seems to sympathize with his desperate characters and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self made misery while the film isn't a must see it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little known outside of his own country director precious little of which is available on video here in the u s
<START> granted hotd 2 is better than the uwe boll crapfest that was the first one but thats like saying drowning is better than being chopped alive ok ok i'm being a little bit harsh with this one its just that video game adaptations of zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth resident evil was alright but its sequels are pure rubbish the first hotd was entertaining crap more than anything else uwe boll saw to that and hotd 2 was better the entertainment value was there the hot chicks were there the gore was there but this is it the script even though subpar was better than the first one but in the script dwells horribly written characters stupid action sequences clichÃ©s and an ending that drags on and on reaching a level of ridiculousness which would make the very very proud but it could've been worse right br br hotd 2 stars sig haig yes sid haig as an insane doctor looking for a cure to death as you may guess it all goes to sh t a nearby college campus seems to be the center for the zombie or epidemic and as you may expect a group of commandos and two zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and the problem their main goal no it ain't blowing sh t up instead they have to get a sample of zombie blood so they can create a cure to the deadly virus between this and that lays bland character interactions an insufferable amount of clichÃ©s but hey at least the black guy isn't the first one to get killed and decent looking zombies br br the acting is passable who would've thought that sticky was a passable actor not me emmanuelle vaugier and ed quinn shine somewhat as the leads and the supporting cast was passable too it was all passable br br the make up effects on the zombies were alright it could've been worse like in the first hotd just guys running around in dusty mummy suits the gore was alright too cheap scares and even cheaper tension are almost non existent in this movie which is a good thing the action sequences were stupid as f ck but at least there wasn't any sword fighting zombies or that ridiculous slow motion bullet effect br br overall this movie will appeal only to zombie enthusiasts fans of the arcade games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend apparently there's going to be a third one as hinted by the ending but i wouldn't count on it unless uwe decides to do it a 4
<START> this has got to be one of the better post astaire musicals made by columbia produced by arthur schwartz and directed by vet charles vidor this picture really put gene kelly on the map and cemented rita hayworth's reputation as cinema's premier female dance partner she plays a bit of a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with gene and co star phil silvers but also puts her in the role of her grandmother a nightclub performer in the late 19th br br the music should also be singled out because this was i believe the last project that the legendary jerome kern most famous today for old man river and smoke gets in your eyes worked on and his lyricist was the equally legendary ira gershwin they supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization the music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it's so perfectly styled in the early 20th century idiom that was original period it's a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that time br br the story is pretty inconsequential which is fine with me because this film is as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s 40s golden age of broadway musical comedy style on film even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the film's music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing make way for tomorrow and even humorously poke fun at america's enemies and use period slang such as referring to gremlins br br probably the most memorable performance in the film is kelly's dance to the alter ego dance which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience this prefigures much of his later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itself br br fans will want to seek this out for various reasons kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of mgm with a different set of co stars and music superior to his usual mgm material hayworth fans will want to see rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability and fans of classic broadway musicals will definitely want to hear final score and marvel at the quality of gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles this is a definite gem in the crown of columbia's musical program
<START> oh so beautiful oh so tearful and so gut wrenching br br makes everything seem so superficial so pale so meaningless in comparison br br sister helen is not a real saint br br she is a real human flawed raw and blunt but passionate and with a heart of gold br br what i found most interesting is that this handful of wretched miserable people found meaning and laughter br br what i loved most is how the documentary portrayed the of human nature
<START> oh boy oh boy this movie is something for the lovers of real art it really does not make any sense at all it is totally boring especially because of the anti climaxes all people behave more than strange and unrealistic sometimes it feels like sitting in a theatre because in dialogues the actors tend to face the camera and therefore the audience instead of each other like i said before if you are in to those more artful movies shown in cannes go for it if you are not better leave this movie alone because you will be more than disappointed and in the end know that you have wasted your time like i did two thumbs down
<START> starting with a my name is joe like scene in alcoholics anonymous careers into a mad spiral of infidelity double standards and clandestine affairs but what do you expect from a family of lawyers br br a genuinely funny film with some of the most outrageous characters since the birdcage plot and subplot are intertwined with surreal scenes of decadent parisian life ever been to a wedding reception in the gents toilet where the brides grandmother and her deranged girlfriend are smoking dope and cracking blue jokes no me either leading to a final scene of almost symbolism br br excellent
<START> i don't understand jokes i do believe this is my problem with modern cinema or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation isn't it odd Â people just don't laugh as much anymore and i do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film showtime there was absolutely nothing from the beginning to the end of the credits with all of the bantering between murphy and de niro with russo as eye candy with even standard clichÃ©s which make the general population swoon with pre programmed laughter there was nothing in this film that made me laugh there weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film from the beginning i didn't buy the match up of de niro and murphy as anything more than hollywood excitement throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot Â where was it in the film this falls to either two problems Â the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film either way they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the hollywood nightmare showtime br br outside of finding no reason to laugh there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film there was a glimpse of humor with de niro's desire to pick up pottery as a hobby but the director had to write on the machine so audiences would understand Â who does that but that was dropped and never developed there was the idea that murphy was an actor but outside of that one opening monologue nobody would have understood that he rents a room in a producer's house in which he can afford on a police officer's salary this just didn't compute even for hollywood standards there was a bad guy who wanted a big gun but the gun was never developed nor was there any true test of the weapons capability Â even at the end it became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns where was the television show in this russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning but there were no consequences there was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble random characters were introduced forgotten re introduced and forgotten all over again the director and producer laughed at this while we the meager viewer must suffer through inside jokes and clichÃ© stereotypes br br was there a love interest in this film was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to robert de niro was there random chaos throughout this film if you need the answers to these obviously you won't find them in showtime the fact that i am this review with question upon question only means that this sub par actually well below sub sub sub par filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world sure it had big names and one really neat explosion but there was nothing of substance to this at all it was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichÃ©s but not regular clichÃ©s Â go with the bad ones the plot had no linear structure the jokes were boring the characters were drab and underdeveloped this ranks below even the best of buddy cop films i like to give films the benefit of the doubt but nothing worked in this film not even shatner could save this film and he even tried hard br br overall i cannot nor will i suggest this film to anyone with a pulse the commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws horrid jokes and creators questioning the validity of their work if creators can't stand behind showtime why should we i didn't want a lethal weapon when i watched this but i did want something like that i understand there was some form of criticism of reality television and the corrupt nature of the media but that message didn't make it off the page in fact i believe i saw media leave the theater first when i watched this shame carries its heavy hand with this film and i cannot blame it murphy used to be a big star comedy was his middle name see coming to america but lately he seems to have lost his edge de niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further one of these films is equal to one scorsese picture br br skip this one i promise it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile oh and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film Â i am truly sorry br br grade out of
<START> i had to watch this movie for professional reasons and can only say it's a complete waste of time when running baldwin looks like an ape characters are dull same story has been told 1000 times better in other movies i think everything has been now said about this film but imdb requires me to write 10 lines so boring and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and trivial
<START> nikki finn is the kind of girl i would marry never boring always thinking positively good with animals okay as one reviewer wrote a bit too much peroxide lipstick and eyebrows only madonna could get away with that but that's why i love nikki finn she's not your ordinary girl she makes things happen always exciting to be around and always honest sure she steals but she doesn't rob or murder unless you're out to do her in she knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be she knows what to take and what can't be stolen if you need a favor from her she's in 100 bottom line she knows how to enjoy life nikki is always loving which is why she has a way with wild animals and completely dedicated to those she loves and who love her br br who's that girl she's the girl for me
<START> my wife and i saw every episode in this series and loved it however the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show it ended with a typical end the season cliff hanger leaving it's fans feeling cheated a waste of great writing and acting
<START> the late shift is a great book i read the book several years ago and i was transfixed at the cutthroat debauchery that went on when johnny carson retired and jay leno and johnny carson tried to grab his spot when the movie came out i snagged a vhs copy of the movie and having reread the book recently it's hard to say which i enjoy more because they're quite equal in the amount of information conveyed the two lead actors john michael higgins and daniel roebuck two actors i never heard of before and haven't heard of since play leno and letterman convincingly despite letterman's dismissal of his portrayal as being poor they play the parts quite well despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two i wasn't as interested in that the story is what counts and that brings me to kathy bates kathy bates playing helen is this movie she plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly you realize how on earth can this woman control herself much less a national tv show yikes there should be a sequel
