<START> if you watch this movie you'll be quoting it and referring to it for a long time to come it's been years since i saw dolemite and i still quote it to this day it's a true classic it is so mind numbingly awful that it makes a hilarious view every terrible line of dialogue is totally amazing every wobbly shot a work of art and every punch and kick so woefully executed you won't believe your eyes it's all i can say if i really get into how mesmerizing this movie is i won't be able to stop and i'll go way over the imdb 1000 word limit br br please please watch this movie you'll be in hysterics either 1 10 or 10 10 depending on your sense of humor
<START> if this is classed as 'real life' of london then the producers must be on different planet br br it is the most depressing suicidal dark dingy dross on tv br br everyone is fighting everything has nasty under tones running through it nothing is done for genuine reasons br br if you want a real life picture of people in london or the uk then this programme is by the farthest from reality br br there is not one good word i can say about this programme the only certainty is that will be a great big fight over christmas dinner br br even the characters are totally unbelievable
<START> i saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends its reputation had preceded it and though all my friends were also of legal age i alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it we gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend though we sat in close proximity to each other we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence as it turned out the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt it did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content but it disappointed in every other way br br caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick it fails miserably in its ambition subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds the film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real graphic sex but in setting this sex in the context of caligula's depraved reign it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of caligula in it sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination in the present day it is somewhat common to hear words like sin and depravity used to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it br br the historical portions not only fail to meaningfully the sex they fail to entertain enlighten intrigue or interest the viewer in any way they only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium rarely has a film proved so boring the sex after the initial shock and astonishment fades only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture br br rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence while many films more violent than caligula have been made few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence apparenly unrelenting as well as hyper depraved sexuality characterized caligula's the violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex br br a review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it i understand why someone would want to see this film after all i myself succumbed to the same curiosity i simply hope that my review by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not my high school criminal justice teacher described police work as hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror this statement perfectly describes caligula you have been warned
<START> not only that the vhs and dvd cover at least in europe show a scene that has nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie the acting is so bad that the movie is crying out for being made fun of if you have nothing to do you are with some good friends and you want to have some laughs about a movie that is supposed to be serious watch and peter onorati a man who will teach you how to knock over bad guys with empty carton boxes shame on dennis hopper following example by starring in his very own battlefield earth for those who want to watch a good movie about the earth being destroyed by a terrible force please do not choose but do yourselves a favor and watch armageddon for he 20th time
<START> carson daly has to be the only late night talk show host that isn't a comedian what was nbc thinking he's not funny the writing is horrible to all of the sketches are painful to watch the current new karaoke isn't funny at all especially since he tells you what they are going to sing before they sing it the escalator interviews is just stupid and needless to say not funny at all all he jokes especially during the monologue are the least clever dumbest not funny jokes ever put on television i mean anytime he makes a jessica simpson joke he ends it with because she's stupid which cancels out any that was in the joke which was already very low any 3 year old could have come up with any of the jokes and sketches they put on this lame excuse for a show seriously don't watch this show unless you're on the edge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge
<START> i couldn't agree more the book is one of dean best novels and this film is a total travesty i watched about half of it then threw the tape in the bin in disgust i have no idea what the idiotic director was thinking making this piece of crap but i would rather poke my eyes out with a sharp stick than watch this useless movie again everything about this film is just wrong first the main character is changed from an ex marine to a high school kid why second the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie hem i bet freud would have something to say about that lol the dog is cute enough and the best thing in the movie and completely outcast everyone else also a main character who helps them in the book betrays them in the movie there really is nothing good to say about the film except that at least it's relatively short at an hour and a half or so if anyone hasn't seen the film yet do yourselves a favour read the book it is so much better than this worthless waste of time
<START> it is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see the english patient again after anthony death most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point the endless moral struggle of those who consciously walk a very thin line in the talented mr ripley moves away from patricia amoral tom ripley to give the murderer a conscience in breaking and entering gives jude law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving here in the english patient the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt ralph and kristin scott thomas are extraordinary they strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us the audience juliette binoche is quite simply spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful andrews are filled with a sensual innocence anthony gave us films that were one way or another that elusive mix of art and commerce he was true to himself but thought about his audience he knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own there is something clear honest and startling about opus i miss him already but i'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind
<START> all i can say about this film is to read the back of the video case and then put it back on he shelf and pick anything else i mean anything a blank video would be better than watching this
<START> even though this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes good pyrotechnics its plot was terrible its horror wasn't really that good its sci fi was even worse but its pyrotechnics were excellent mathilda may was extremely beautiful too
<START> skip this hollywood version a real piece of garbage a cheap insult to the brilliant original spoorloos or by the english title also called the vanishing it completely misses the mark in typical grotesque hollywood fashion usually due to a bunch of talentless corporate bean counters who haven't the vaguest idea about anything artistic they just look for the successful formula and want it applied to everything to glean a profit much like the awful the scarlet letter made in 1995 which twisted the original story around so much to suit the crowd that it became an aberration not even a bastardization but a pile of goop that has been sort of shaped similar but does not look feel or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original except that movie at least had gary oldman who is interesting to watch in anything he does this dog has nothing going for it even the usually very talented jeff bridges is an embarrassment great tragedy is not nor never should be the feel good movie of the year but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition br br do yourself a great favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a dutch french collaboration in 1988 that is a great film this is a horrific mess
<START> someone once defined what is the definition of an intellectual as being a person who can listen to the william tell overture without thinking of the lone ranger in this we heartily concur it surely would be a tall order to accomplish this and one that leopold arturo or leonard bernstein would all find nigh well impossible to do br br and in this there is no disgrace the radio series and the television series along with some movie serials feature films syndicated newspaper comic strip and comic books all did their part to make the masked man of the plains and his faithful indian companion tonto a deeply seeded element of our collective psyche and of our literary folklore br br as with most legends it all started gradually first with a series of radio plays written for local use in detroit over radio station the creator was one george w and the principal writer on the series was mr brother in law mr fran striker the year was 1933 when the ranger first rode out to Âthe plains of the early western united states the lone ranger tonto and the radio series all successfully guided depression era americans through the mid and late '30's up to and through world war ii but the post war era found the country in the midst of a super nova explosion of invention and technology there had been a new communications medium standing ready in the wings but unable to go forth until both ve day and vj day had been achieved once these were accomplished and the world and america was ready to settle down to both peace and prosperity the new technology was of course was television and we would surely need something else than roller derby and wrestling from arena to fill up the broadcast hours and while at first the time that a tv station had anything on except that portrait of that mohican chief test pattern schultz very soon and with post haste the networks began tapping their existing natural resources their existing programming virtually all would be ripe for adaptation to the tv screen br br so the folks over at lone ranger incorporated were very interested when producers jack chertok harry sherman harris and jack all approached them with a deal to put the masked man and tonto on the television waves as well as the radio br br immediately they went to work and gave us the first season which made use of the considerable back log of radio dramas all potentially adaptable to tv dramas they cast clayton moore a fine supporting actor in many a feature film and with about a dozen years experience he also had done some work in serials over at republic pictures' thrill factory which would be invaluable experience in doing the lone ranger cast as his faithful indian companion and partner in bringing justice to various parts of the frontier we had sheer perfection in character supporting actor jay we must mention that there was that rift in about when clayton moore walked and was replaced with john hart after a season or so mr moore was back in having been missed so much now back to our story the first years of filming gave the episodes a look and a sound all of their own they made good use of off screen narrator which gave these shows a feel of authenticity and an individual stand out one of a kind series the actors employed were all veterans of the movies of the late silent era thru the 1930's and 1940's a lot of them had been just about exclusively cowboy movie players a good example of these is the casting of glenn strange bartender sam on gunsmoke as the vicious murderous gang leader butch and it was the gang's massacre of the texas rangers that led to the origin of john reid thought to have been slain with the other texas rangers as the lone ranger br br in addition to the old timers in the cast you will find a lot of new and up and coming talent then in the cast we see people like phyllis coates dwayne hickman denver pyle and others in the cast from week to week all of this along with an always calling for fair play justice and peace in a western world br br the last couple of seasons brought some big changes first was the use of colour filming that made no difference as a colour tv set was still a long way off for our household the second was a new set of musical themes and queues other than finale from u no the new music was never a big deal to us as we preferred the old radio stock stuff br br with this series and two feature films done during this period the lone ranger warner brothers 1956 and the lone ranger and the lost city of gold united artists 1958 the character has been permanently and indelibly impressed in our identity as a people we americans
<START> films belonging to the film noir genre usually contain similar elements a deus ex machina plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam a pretty but psychotic girl a handsome but psychotic thug lots of money lots of brutality and usually a denouement in the desert think high sierra or white heat br br there is plenty of hard boiled bad film noir out there but when film noir is good you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives br br it is this latter tradition that blind spot belongs to the film follows danny alton a troubled teenager superbly played with depth grace emotional integrity and downright by james franco who throws himself completely into this role who has fallen in love with the rough edged darcy br br from the beginning you know this is going to be bad br br darcy invites danny to his house but the house is empty and for sale and a bloody check for thousands of dollars is on the floor danny is robbed of his clothing and possessions but uses the check to track down the suicidal april other lover when they reach real home they find wayne a thug hunting darcy down for the money he's stolen together the three manage to locate darcy in a dusty run down motel in the desert but that's only the beginning of the tale as plastic explosives drugs gun running a creepy funeral home bisexual assassins and a lonely half finished house in the desert bring events to an explosive head in an alley outside a tattoo parlor in los angeles br br this film contains some of the best noir cinematography i have seen in years in one scene danny races on foot through the desert to the half finished house in the desert where he believes darcy may have been taken that evening by mobsters a very long shot with sharp lighting effects shows danny arms and legs flailing palpable fear etched on his face visible even at this distance dust cloud trailing behind him as the wind whips in his direction racing across the desert flats toward the house the loneliness the desperation the despair danny feels is shocking depicted there are many such scenes in this film wonderfully crafted by the experienced this is oscar winning material br br the editing too is just astounding the film contains little moments where the characters gain insight into themselves or their situation bits of time where memory and feeling come flooding back at these times quick montages of images flash across the screen this is superb editing by director writer editor stephan in one early montage danny describes the wondrous feelings he has now that darcy has entered his life quick images of danny's diary flash across the screen the words 4 life lucky and safe stop momentarily while page upon page of words the contents of a human heart race across the screen out of focus too quick to read it's like the flood of emotion danny himself feels br br the flood of images reveals something else about this film just how beautiful nathaniel waters' production design is hut home is the perfect match of high tech and slob a tribute to the of set decorator kimberly foster the stunning desert house scene is just outright creepy the ruined motel where darcy hides out can be found in any abandoned small town in america the creepy and astoundingly lit funeral home where the plot takes a horrific turn mixes starkness with the pall of death hanging over the entire film it's too bad the film's lighting director is not credited this film has a superb production design one that enhances every single frame and every actor's performance br br that's the fourth element of this film which makes it grab you and hold on to you the acting james franco is a superb actor even in spider man where he was given practically nothing to do franco showed that he understands human emotion like no other actor of his generation he's no pretty boy coasting on his good looks like brad pitt franco portrays deep emotion with full force his performances contain pure human heart consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home where danny collapses after telling april and wayne that darcy is dead lesser actors couldn't carry off the complete emotional breakdown of a human being franco does br br shawn montgomery in her first film simply blows you away with her performance as the suicidal april deeply in love with darcy suffering from massive depression after having to bury alone her unborn child after the fetus spontaneously aborts in a perfume box in the woods her life of luxury and perfection now a shambles april is one of the best drawn characters on film that i have ever seen while danny's relationship to darcy is slowly teased out during the film april's nervous breakdown is revealed only to the audience neither danny nor wayne seem particularly interested in her as a human being april's despair when she realizes danny has also been lover is poignant and potent even if it is truncated by the character's complete inability to feel any emotion for very long now montgomery brings to april a pathos that puts your heart through the wringer br br mark patrick gleason is given the hardest job in the film having to make something human and real out of the thug wayne at first wayne is simply one of any number of violent foul mouthed obsessed drug pushers gun runners that appears in any number of films from kindergarten cop to beverly hills cop 2 gleason does very well with what he's given but he doesn't quite get to where you feel much for wayne it's difficult to say whether this is gleason's problem or the material's there is one moment where wayne who is brother although neither danny nor april know this reads danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional link between the two men where you just know that wayne is going to go homophobic on danny's ass but the explosion never comes thank god trite plots are death to film noir once the revelation about the siblings comes at the film's end the audience is fairly astounded to realize the depth of love and compassion wayne truly felt for darcy so deep that wayne accepted danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother but this all happens off screen gleason is never given a chance to act out wayne's feelings it must have been very frustrating for the performer br br the story is rather inventive although the smuggling device seen at the end of the film is likely to remind viewers of diamonds are forever yes james bond a traditional narrative voice over which proves franco is as great a voice talent as he is a physical actor provides terrific atmosphere although it does tend to flow over into schmaltz a few times toward the end of the film providing some unintentional laughter terrific locales play key visual roles in the film kudos to the location scout for finding such astounding buildings the end of the film struck me as a bit rushed not pat but a little too firm for my film noir tastes br br now i've seen audiences either hate or love blind spot modern film audiences exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence often have little appreciation for the subtleties of film noir my suggestion is to take a small group of friends who don't see despair emotional collapse desperation or depression as laughable take them to a small theater where they can glory in the spectacle of the film's vision but where their viewing won't be ruined by a crowd of people who won't recognize good film noir get them some popcorn trust me they'll be so engrossed they won't finish it get them a soda and let them be overwhelmed go some place bright and cheery afterward to wash the grime and out of your soul because this film is so good at making you feel you'll need that
<START> it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie i have to say it is really hard to make a good and or realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money also i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on first the cockpit look a lot like an cockpit second you got a stick third using computers to control elevators via fly by wire when i saw this movie i thought like the intention of the film was don't fly with computerized airplanes like use boeing instead they have a direct connection of steering and br br all i can say bad story horrible acting most of the actors worst film trick ever
<START> a film to divide its viewers just criticism points at its funereal pace over used snap zooms and persistent lingering gazes between the protagonists advocates point to dirk mighty performance and pasqualino de benchmark photography of venice br br taken altogether this might suggest an indulgent romanticised for the nobility of homosexual love at a time 1971 when it was becoming legal in fact visconti has succeeded in making a richer more complex film than such a single issue vehicle he has knit his ideas foibles and all into a meticulously paced arc br br inside this does indeed sit the central performance of rather than a simpering johnny come lately gay he manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity who sees salvation in his mesmerised staggering around an increasingly hellish venice after the boy is a straight metaphor for the artist's tenacity for truth in the teeth of the dilettante mob and it is explicitly cut with such a flashback br br music is possibly a little over used although it is well appropriated the italian overdub is a wearing anachronism but thankfully the acting doesn't suffer too much 7 10
<START> super original really great movie james franco and sienna miller really do go so well together on screen i sure hope it comes out soon i first saw this movie at a screening because of my age and gender i was asked to stay for a talk we all got to comment on the movie and a lot of people didn't seem to like it i really loved it and i don't know why so many people didn't think it was that good go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself one thing that you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to go into it not knowing anything about it i had not known anything when i went to the screening other than it was called it really is worth seeing
