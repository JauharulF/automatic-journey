<START> ok i am a huge traci fan so her just being in the movie automatically makes it rank at the 8 5 rating but even besides her being in it i thought it was a good movie especially for it being an hbo movie but i am afraid if you take traci out of the movie it would just be ok but a person can't do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress she just keeps getting better and better
<START> im sorry to myself you know why i feel pained from the viewing of this movie i went to the theater with some friends to see this movie and still did not give it the satisfaction of watching it in entirety i left with about 20 minutes left hoping to god it might make me at least comfortable for a moment most movies now even this bad ones when i watch them there may be a small part in the movie where i feel some joy at times because of maybe a quirky joke or a good line this movie on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable and mad at myself the whole time especially since i wasted money on it it was poorly written poorly directed poorly shot and definitely poorly acted br br please for the good of humanity do not see this movie even if your some guy who wants to say he has seen like every movie ever just don't
<START> any evening with jonathan ross now means to me his wit in first hassling and upsetting with carefully chosen words a 78 year old man by phone and then suggesting he and russell brand should house break and masturbate him while he slept as a way to say sorry for making obscene phone calls to him kinky and illegal for a really big laugh maybe next time he should try it on someone he knows well like his boss or a follower of abu would he be amused if someone did it to one of his daughters br br over all the years i've perhaps seen less than 30 minutes of bbc star man ross's chat show because i find him so loathsome some of the guests i saw were ok though probably most of them who ever appeared were ok for all i know as a chat show it seems pretty poor though Â what's so chatty about asking tory leader david cameron on this tv programme whether he ever masturbated to photographs of margaret thatcher he up gwyneth paltrow by simply asking her if she wanted to f him however ross's mentality was finally totally exposed with the above revelations and i thought i'd take the opportunity to warn the few decent folk around the world who might not know just how vile this man is and to steer clear of him and his unless you think all comedy should be edgy ie obscene vacuous we're not yet all the same here although bbc and channel 4 are jettisoning all standards br br in october 2008 ross with fellow russell brand made a series of premeditated sexual obscene phone calls to andrew sachs' answer phone manuel from fawlty towers had it broadcast as intended on bbc national radio against sachs' request and then tried to get sachs' granddaughter to burn the evidence in case they got prosecuted a significant number of people over here probably most of them non bbc license fee payers found it hilarious and or that the national scandal had been overblown but many people apparently still knew right from wrong and 42 eventually complained to bbc about the incident many media fools and others snickered about these 42 never having heard the radio programme and never wanting to using their argument they presumably also consider an event such as the holocaust justified because at the time relatively few people complained to the media and none of us here now should be horrified by it because we weren't there the 2 bbc producers initially involved in passing it for broadcast thought it was very funny and brilliant comedy and only 2 people complained about brand's radio programme at the time which i'm afraid only indicated the moral level his 400 000 weekly listeners had sunk to with the help of bbc expertise highly moral bbc tried and failed to use it in in the later investigation roll over aristotle tell lord the news sachs' agent complained to bbc but was ignored by them until a tory national newspaper got hold of the story the penalty for any ordinary pervert doing this would normally be sacking and prosecution maybe even prison but while brand and the head of bbc radio 2 were both eventually ordered to resign the multi millionaire ross was given a 12 week holiday by bbc's boss i suppose that he asked ross's permission first though if he could dock ross's pay by Â£1 500 000 to prevent him from suing to come back to this programme afresh in 2009 before his contract runs out all that time to think of more smut and or more insulting for his 4 000 000 viewers to admire but at least he could still chortle his way to the bank as usual to keep his spirits up some people think that his position will be untenable and he won't be able to carry on i think his skin is so thick because the stakes are so high that he will come back unbowed and re energised with pent up vitriol update 23 01 09 i've just watched the first 5 minutes of his new series the most enormous cock up to use his referential phrase is continuing to allow this sniggering unrepentant law breaker to take the public's money like this but who knows maybe in the future after the slimy british film tv industries have comforted him for the moral stance taken by the 42 and showered him with awards he will become a sir for his services to perversion by the perverts in government at the least i hope this pair of edgy deviants sign up with other perverted commercial tv and radio stations and stay there so i won't be paying for their the law and spouting illegal obscenities in the future in 2009 fined british tv license fee payers 000 for this sorry affair thanks ross for offering to pay not br br to the apologists get a life sense of humour sense of proportion it's not the end of the world having a pair of talentless perverts as your heroes and there's far more important things to worry about in this world like the price of real cheese to sum up family man dross a comedy genius to apparently millions of people especially himself merely a nasty obscene phone caller receiving an obscene wage packet from an obscene multimedia company to others so much for our society of political correctness and respect as you should've guessed it doesn't apply to the rich and famous and never will but only to the poor to sum up bbc stumbling blindly on from now i hope its next crisis will be i also hope anyone who thinks comedy should be always challenging and pushing back boundaries ie offensive aren't challenged or offended by my opinion of this particular law breaking pervert his perverted programmes and his current perverted employers
<START> i found this movie on one of my old videos after godzilla vs the sea monster which should instantly give you an idea of it's tone and i hadn't seen it in a while so i decided to watch it i didn't remember much about rainbow except i used to like the cartoon and that it was cute most people feel that way about her you probably do to br br well when the movie started i wondered if it was the right one it didn't fit the mold of rainbow as i remembered her but it turns out she kicks butt this has to be the strangest animated movie ever i can't believe these characters were so popular the series isn't much different while being so bizzare as soon as i watched this movie again it became one of my favorites br br i really don't want to give too much away just know that if you see the movie in the video store rent it and watch it no questions asked you will get a kick out of it especially the outrageous princess character and the robotic horse and the hypnotized sprites br br if you can't tell by know this is an 80's cartoon that is really an undiscovered head movie in disguise have fun
<START> i am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case i'll make an exception the first scenes of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it sucks this is one movie were i rooted for the bad guys because the captain save the day was unbelievable and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him the lead actor gave the weakest performance and laurence fishburne or matt dillon couldn't even save this movie sometime there are eye openers or great moments in a film that may not be that great this movie has none if you are looking for a movie to see in the meantime while nothing peeked your interest don't choose this one save your money
<START> joe is one of those movies where although you think that it might go along smoothly ends up hitting you like i can't come up with an analogy it showed not only that america's long standing idea of unity was moot but also the various aspects within our society melissa compton susan sarandon is the ultimate flower child while her father bill dennis patrick is a clean cut executive one day bill accidentally kills melissa's boyfriend in the immediate aftermath bill gets acquainted with joe peter boyle an ultra right wing rabidly racist working stiff as a result the two of them end up associating more and more with the hippies whom bill finds unpleasant and joe outright hates but in the end everything has dead serious consequences br br true some parts of the movie are a little bit dated but it's a good juxtaposition of america's two sides during the vietnam war and rest assured the residual effects of all that will probably never go away
<START> bloody awful there's just no other way to put it in fact it's so bad that the only reason i'm wasting words on this is to warn off other reasonable viewers who want to be intelligently entertained you'll lose i q points watching this come to think of it it's not even suitable for mindless viewing because of the irritation factor there's no guilty pleasure in watching something this incompetent br br reasons to avoid it br br 1 horribly scientifically inaccurate to the point where this isn't sci fi anymore it's just sloppy lazy fantasy br br 2 it sports fx that are cheesy beyond belief not even cheesy kitsch that's a wink and a nod like vintage doctor who but just cheap and shoddy to the point of being insulting the fx are so bad they're not even laughable they spent about a dollar fifty on this not more br br 3 the direction is so weak and mindless that the only way the actors could make it through to the end of shooting without becoming terminally depressed was to sleepwalk through their roles although catherine mccormack made some effort anyway probably on principle and despite the director moreover this isn't peter only bad film his flubs vastly outnumber any barely salvageable ones of which timecop was the last such and that was 15 years before this writing he's had nothing halfway decent since end of days was just as slapdash arnold was the only draw and he needed much firmer direction than provided just keeps making it more and more pointless for anyone to consider giving him more work br br and finally br br 4 ray bradbury's stories deserve far better treatment than this refusing to watch this film sends that message not that hollywood is particularly listening br br watch at your own risk if you do and it turns you off movies altogether you've only yourself and to blame because you've been more than adequately warned
<START> on the opening night of the san francisco silent film festival i was quite excited to see films that are historical and well not common the guest speaker who opened this film created a sense of hype towards the obscurity and how this film is underrated the sci fi part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time but i'm not sure if it was due to the fact it was shown directly after the brilliant 1928 the wind or if it seemed that russian filmmakers take after what russian novels are famous for hundreds of characters tangled plots but i know for certain that the dramatic parts as in the parts on earth made absolutely no sense were boring and i became lost within about twenty minutes maybe it was the acting but i found myself convinced as to why this film is unknown and underrated it's boring there is no plot or basic story and the acting is horrible this certainly is no battleship potemkin however i will say that russian films do not make a real good effort in lightning up what life in russia is like
<START> half empty is a hilarious musical about the eternal optimist this case a self help book writer who goes to germany mistakenly thinking he's popular there instead of an adoring audience he finds himself adrift in a world of jaded misanthropes including the woman who is supposed to be his publicist his attempts to make scenes that are largely to one great encounter after another when he is verbally abused by nihilistic musicians gruff gangsters etc in time he manages to win over his her heart and her mind but his own world view is shaken when his hero a much more popular self help writer turns out to be not quite what he seems the action is punctuated by several musical numbers br br we saw this at the film festival in oklahoma city and were blown away this is a really funny inspired small scale indie production you could quibble about a few technical things like the lighting which is a bit dark but the piece is funny and inspired enough that you can't care too much if voltaire were writing candide today the character would be a self help writer
<START> the duo of abbott and costello lives on in this version of a story time classic in jack and the there's everything to see music magic and comedy rolled into one costello play plays jack after he listens to the story being told by a young boy one time we know jack was a poor boy who sells his cow dolly for 5 magic beans well he plants those 5 beans and they were indeed magic he climbs to the sky sees a big castle there and he would sing a song unknown he would encounter the giant buddy baer not only him he would dance with the woman who was also a giant she would clobber jack with her elbows during the dance that was funny you got the playing harp who knows how to put the giant as ease the goose who lays golden eggs and my favorite the way jack gets rid of the giant he gets the ax and started chopping down on the another funny is where the ax got stuck during the chop and the final celebration happens when the people dance around the imprint where the giant fell a lot of fun and fun for the whole family as well very recommended 5 stars
<START> wicked little things known in australia as zombies is a rare find Â a film that promises one thing but delivers another it is one of the few genre films to be made by millennium pictures a european film studio known for making various b grade action films thrillers some featuring action star jean claude van damme br br karen her two daughters sarah emma arrive in the town of in order to move into a large house that karen's late husband owned after finding a miner's deed in his effects once arriving they find that the house is very old in need of repair but the house's condition is the least of their problems as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances karen is confronted by the owner ordered to move out once night falls the find out the reason behind the vanishings a group of zombie children killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago come out to kill anything that goes in the woods with the help of a grizzled neighbour karen attempts to end the curse before her her children become the next victims br br i bought the dvd expecting a film with flesh eating zombies but was let down by one thing the film is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick with the dead children being the embodiment of a curse that haunts the woods taking their revenge on anything that moves around at night although the internal logic is somewhat flawed Â the children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals are repelled by blood wards on doors in the same manner that vampires are repelled by garlic mirrors Â aren't these kids supposed to be zombies the plot as such would not be a problem would actually be entertaining but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film only to fall flat on their faces with this effort br br as such a film like this would be okay as a ghost story but due to a poor script becomes nothing more than an entirely routine effort the film's greatest strength is the acting with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves of particular note is scout taylor compton who does her role quite well Â it's a shame she ruins her genre cred with a very poor performance in the halloween remake or maybe it's just rob zombie's script
<START> this version of david copperfield is dreadful from start to finish i knew we were in for a wasted evening's viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment attenborough and olivier camp it up as two baddies it was all downhill after this aunt betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for the worst of the worst was the producer's choice for uriah this was the music hall version of this character previously and admirably played by roland young and what was all this self absorbed angst from david dickens must have rolled over in his grave to see his favorite child turned into a wimp weeping in his beer br br this was one time when hollywood knew more than jolly old england
<START> well the episode i just watched had the older girl whining about why people keep mentioning her husband mr a famous american football player apparently she seems unwilling to accept that he's the only reason she isn't flipping burgers she married someone famous and that's why she has cameras pointed at her br br when challenged by an interviewer to explain what she actually does she gave a wonderfully circular reason for why people should pay attention to her i work really hard on my reality tv show then she said i'm not a celebrity i'm a personality br br i'm not quite sure who this series is meant to appeal to except people who've had all their intelligence removed it's certainly no role model to anyone except gold diggers as the two stars do nothing but spend money and all it tells you about rich people is that they have no money problems
<START> there's nothing to say except i want my time back that this movie took from me i'm not racist against latinos hell i'm half brazilian i loved the movie kids it doesn't make any sense these kids just go around and do nothing they're not even good at skating the whole time i'm just waiting for something anything to happen but it doesn't nothing happens the whole movie did i mention they suck at skating i might make a movie called beat up rockers and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh t out of poser moron punks like these kids i'm not even going to get into it this movie sucks please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake
<START> where to start where to start hmmm well how about some of the stiffest most unnatural unbelievable and camped up performances one can imagine how about stereotypical characters situations and locations or what about a manipulative cloying utterly wretched script i can't think of one element in this movie that was original worthy of watching or interesting br br note to all you josh hartnett chris klein leelee sobieski fans enjoy their collective fifteen minutes folks because they're not going to be famous much longer
