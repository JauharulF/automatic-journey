<START> this first and hopefully not last wallace gromit feature lives up to expectations there are plenty of jokes some a bit cheeky as well as some great tributes to past science fiction movies with the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from hollywood it's great to see such a great film like this that's enjoyable for almost everyone if there is any justice it will be top of the box office and be at least nominated for best animation at the next oscars the animation is wonderful the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun this is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy charming clever fun and well made what's not to enjoy
<START> i saw this movie when it aired on lifetime back in 2004 i have never seen it since then but have thought of it often it left such an impression on me i've been searching for it lately i found it finally and realized it was made just for television the movie is fabulous filled with great writing and acting william petersen is perfect as always this movie left me speechless and in tears it's a wonderful story of faith love and compassion does anybody know how i can obtain a copy of this movie for my home is that possible with television movies i really would love to see it again this is a must have among my collection
<START> while i hold its predecessor fast times at ridgemont high as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared the wild life is one of the better lesser known films from that time and a worthy sequel if you can call it that i believe its tagline reads from the makers of something even faster this definitely holds true though it may lack the depth of the former which tackles issues like first dates teen sex and abortions the wild life is nonetheless a great flick it's pure chaotic fun especially due to chris penn's over the top character thomas drake if was high on coke instead of weed he would be drake eric stoltz in his first major role is great as the straight laced bill conrad the two characters work well off one another think a younger hipper odd couple complete with 80's gloss outside of them there are so many other great things about this film worth mentioning lea has never looked cuter especially during the scenes of her working at the donut shop jenny wright is just delectable and fun to watch rick moranis plays a great nerd perv who is dying to get in her pants thomas drake's wrestler buddies are hysterical especially benny the little puerto rican guy who says some pretty memorable lines one in particular that he yells out during a night out at a strip club had me on the floor the first time i saw it that's saying something finally the movie ends with one of the best 80's party scenes on film ever look out for special appearances by ron wood of the rolling stones leo penn sean and chris penn's dad and a random michael jackson look alike at the party throw in a score by none other than the man himself eddie van halen and you can't go wrong for van hagar fans keep your ears open for riffs that would be found on such albums as and for unlawful carnal knowledge br br if anything disrupts the flow of the movie it is a small subplot involving randy quaid as a burned out vietnam vet it just seems out of place and unnecessary other than that it's near perfect if your a fan of mindless but fun 80's movies and have not yet seen this one you're in for something special rent it now br br p s the credits say cameron crowe has a cameo as one of the cops in the film does he have his back turned during his scene because i have yet to find him someone please help me
<START> this movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of indian society what it tries to show you is only one side of the story the other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of indian children which this movie does not show br br indian parents are culpable for the following a destroying the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age such children grow up to be adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds since everything has been provided to them by their great indian parents they children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parents br br b i can show you so many indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adults br br the reason why they do is the same selfishness indian parents expect their children to take care of them when they grow old they do no savings for themselves and once they reach the age of 50 they cry out loud we have grown old now and so we are dependent on you children since we have done the great service of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weak br br most of the indian parents at the age of 50 have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure most feel that they absolutely have no need to take care of themselves since they expect their kids to take care of them br br in the west the opposite of that happens people start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they retire they are financially secure br br indian parents do nothing of that sort since like i said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at that br br i am a victim of my indian parents i am sure there are countless other indian kids like me who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on their own and they continue to have 50 year olds who cry out loud for help all the time br br this movie shows only one side of the story utter piece of junk
<START> this is an alright show to watch its not the best nor the worst i've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff this show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently i dislike that crap i have no iq why they completely changed the theme of this show the first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing the 2nd season is just out of this world dumb i seriously don't know why the writers directors changed this show up many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd i will only watch the first season of this show from now on whenever i see a new episode ill change the f ckin channel ya heard me it gets a 3 10 because i somewhat enjoyed the 1st season but hated the 2nd and 3rd
<START> i saw this film in a cinema club in germany in 1970 most of the attendees were from the local private school at which i was teaching i had seen a few godard films previously while i lived in france and though they hadn't been my favorites i could at least make sense of them being able to speak french helped br br the fairly innocuous beginning of le week end soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images very well maybe too well photographed that soon made no sense to me for me films like books must have some clear sort of meaning this didn't for me i suppose i'm not into artsy films images still haunt me from the film to this day i refuse to eat rabbit meat well loved by the french those who've seen the film might realize why yes the theme of materialism came through but the cannibalism the car wrecks and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only sickened me i'm not sure if i walked out before the end but i certainly felt like it i promised myself that i'd never watch another godard film and i haven't and never knowingly will br br my rating nothing it was the most disgusting film i've ever seen others may have been more inept silly or stupid i've forgotten those while scenes from this one will haunt me forever
<START> as far as fake documentaries go anyone this one is up there with the best it looks very real and that is what it aims for in recent light of events guantanamo this movie is even scarier so you could say it was ahead of it's time when it was released in the 70s br br one can only hope that a government like that doesn't exist looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same 70s mentality screw the politicians and politics in general maybe that wasn't so clever one might think but hey don't forget it's only a movie o
<START> if it had not been for christopher guest's hilarious role i would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes the jokes were flat the movie choppy and slow paced certain characters were obnoxious and painful to watch but guest's character kept me laughing so i stuck with it br br i do feel there are much better choices out there
<START> this was the very first movie i ever saw in my life back in 1974 or 1975 i was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drive in theatre i did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time i went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie after seeing it on the television along with two of my other favourite movies car wash my favourite movie and the wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together about 40 50 75 times i knew that here was a movie that i would have as one of my favourites those three movies were the only live action shows that i could watch as a child br br i would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie but rather an urban interest movie and preach reminded me of some of my uncles especially the wild irish rose that they drank my mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life if you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasn't seen this movie yet then i recommend that you buy the dvd right now i'm glad that i was around to witness some of the goings on of the era
<START> conventional and superficial portrayal was incomplete it is supposed that just a few moments with sheila makes him win her love but the story itself and the songs make it and enjoyable experience essentially the final sequence altough i donÂ´t know why it was given a pg rating br br
<START> nothing carson daly has ever said or done on this show has ever made me laugh or even smile a little i do not understand how this show has survived for so many years br br even the funny band member is just like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to even look at him daly and that dude are just arrogant frat boys it seems like they don't even try to be a little funny br br awful awful awful show br br it makes my soul cry br br i just cannot stress enough how awful this show is don't watch it but if you absolutely have to i recommend clawing your eyes out and clogging your ears with cement beforehand
<START> one day i thought to myself what is the worst possible thing that could happen today i answered my self with a simple oh it already happened i rented killjoy killjoy 2 on dvd well what is there to say the budget was not large enough to rent a police uniform the movie cuts out sex scenes and death scenes there is one funny line that i can remember and the acting is far worse than the first one there seems to be no lighting on the set the woods somewhere and the killer clown known as killjoy who makes leprechaun look like the exorcist is less than spectacular this time he is not portrayed by angel vargas and is completely changed as a character from a crazy irritating clown to a different kind of crazy irritating clown that says child a lot somewhere between freddy krueger and a blade of grass lies this version of killjoy somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of s t lies killjoy 2 it's badness is underrated this movie does not have any redeeming qualities except the song at the very end over the credits which at provides some enjoyment killjoy 2 is not even really a movie so much as an exercise in tension killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered as the worst movie i have ever seen minor spoiler let me describe one of the supernatural kill scenes a girl is locked in a wood shed of some sort maybe an outhouse when killjoy peers in through a hole he has some small chattering teeth like the ones you can buy at spencer's gifts and he does something with them maybe winds them up then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line which can't be written on imdb from what i gather of this scene not from what is shown by the movie the teeth went into the outhouse and killed the girl in some interesting but way and then came back to killjoy if i were those teeth i would have run run far from killjoy so he could never ever get his hands on me again killjoy 2 is hopefully the last killjoy we will have to endure even as a fan of movies others would say are very bad i think that this film could unify the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this film and anything reminding us of it would be destroyed i give it 2 10 simply because the creators succeeded at making the pictures move
<START> i used to work at the company that originally put out this film vestron pictures vestron had the same problem that a lot of small independent film companies had they didn't have a lot of money to put into the production values of their films not that money alone will buy you a good film look at kevin costner's waterworld for instance br br sometimes if you have a talented person in house doing the or development you can create your own new talent but at vestron there wasn't such a person and they always skimped in some crucial area in this case it was on the director and the writer which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie even with the great ensemble cast this film has br br i think the basic premise of this movie was let's put a bunch of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens it's an intriguing idea but not worth your time watching br br most vestron films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them my wife and i developed the ability to spot this quality even in non vestron films many times we were even able to spot that quality from watching only the trailer or tv ad we'd sit there watching the trailer or ad and afterwards we'd turn to each and almost in sync we'd say now that's a vestron movie this is a vestron movie
<START> comedy works best when it relates to stuff that's true but even as such some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile when i look at the daily show i see the whole it's funny because it's true thing but i don't however see the effort and often times i don't if they're being funny or just trying to make a point i notice this mostly in the interview segments the daily show started off as a news parody by definition they poke fun at how the media plays it's own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics then jon stewart came along and it all went to hell thr first years of jon stewart's reign were arguably golden i though he was so funny but then 2004 came along and it's where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on the show's humor has gone stale colbert left steve carell left many of the show's best anchors left and now it's mostly about jon stewart and the show's gone from a parody to a semi serious news show essentially evening news but with some gags here and there for those who haven't seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable i'll give you a brief description of what the show's about at least until 2009 bush cheney and all republicans unless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by democrats as well are stupid evil corrupt and hypocrites anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil corrupt and a hypocrite people who doubt the man made global warming theory are evil and stupid vote democrat there i saved you 25 minutes of your time go watch something else at first i though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda but when i actually see the interviews it becomes crystal clear what this show's about what i mentioned above but i'll get to that in a moment off the humor in the daily show according to jon stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either bush cheney or a random republican humorous because well because jon sets up the joke setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline so unless you the context it's entirely useless as bankable humor also the daily show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand thus making it funny why well because jon said so now imagine the daily show using that formula countless times for years every week and you'll start to understand of what used to be a laugh fest that is now 25 minutes of just silent stares yes even in the lewis black segments at first some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes but now much less of that is apparent and the interview have the most odd sense of bias that i've ever seen jon stewart calls bill o'reilly a bully but what does that make him when he sucks up to every single actor and democrat john kerry before obama today that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative such as weekly own bill he puts them in some sort of people's tribunal as if they're being charged with a crime often times any person on the show who stands up for bush is portrayed as delusional as if that person's out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of america that's the de facto treatment for anybody conservative unless they happen to share a similar point of view with democrats if so it's an endless love fest but still it doesn't matter in the eyes of jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords that's the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely right wing now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor one wonders what'll happen if democrats win the white house
<START> i didn't know what to expect from this i always considered bam and the crew a team of knuckle heads devoted to to doing stupid things for entertainment i didn't know that they could act but everyone who acted in this movie pulled off good performances the hilarity of the ' scene mixes in with ryan dunn's depression and his revenge against his ex girlfriend perfectly at times the movie some scenes seem pointless but at the same time they're funny i recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh but this film may not appeal to those that prefer detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns
