<START> this game requires stealth smart and a steady hand the gameplay is simply the best on top of that though are the interesting extras bullet holes stay in the walls enemies react to specific points where they have been hit by bullets there are tons of motion captured animations that make the enemies seem very real for instance when looking through a window at a guard he will stand there flies away sneezing or scratching himself the list goes on this is the best licensed movie conversion ever and it puts you in the shoes of the super spy this game is the best reason for owning an n64
<START> is an interesting film i personally love the dogma movement i wish it had lasted longer it seems to have already died many critics tried their to shut it down i don't know why it's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the french new wave besides i've seen the first three in the series idioterne and mifune they were all great being a masterpiece in my opinion isn't up to those others i was just fascinated with the filmmaking it's played as if it were a real documentary with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down at a few points in the film it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction but that illusion was protracted for an amazing amount of time i wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put onscreen it is basically about this guy fabian who is an argentinian visiting the islands were only in the last couple of months allowed onto the islands and fabian plans to impregnate the women with argentinian children he sets his eyes on one and most of the movie is spent on her seduction the two actors are very natural camilla only kind of hints that she is an actress fabian seems completely real the politics of the film are somewhat confusing to me since i have only an inkling of the situation surrounding the island and its recent history i was 3 i think when the were invaded the final bit of the film doesn't work at all i don't get what the filmmakers were going for there still is an interesting dogma experiment it does break some dogma rules though notably the no extra diagetic music rule there is a lot of that 7 10
<START> hello again i have been thinking about this movie all my life i saw it when i was 5 years old in los angeles california in 1942 what a wonderful story of being good to one another kindness and charity you forget it is the bugs relating to one another it was just as if they were people i love this movie and so do my adult children such beautiful color in this movie i need to see this movie again there is a story about an envelope in the movie that i just can't remember the why of it br br thanks for listening
<START> this is a really amazing story and the most amazing part of it all is that it really happend in case you haven't noticed it's based on a true story br br possible spoiler br br imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your own father was once a ss officer in ww ii br br it's a very intriguing story and i'm really surprised the movie is rated a lousy 5 3 here on imdb com br br my rate 7
<START> robin williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him this may work if you buy into the u s a number one mentality but story wise nothing much happens quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely it just doesn't pack enough emotional punch
<START> this movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate my nieces have watched it non stop since they've gotten it and as a result i've seen it nearly 4 times all the way through i can't get enough of it the cgi images are great to watch the humor is good and the ballet portrayals are excellent although the story line has a few holes no little girl will pick up on them and as an adult the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices just keep in mind that it is a barbie movie and though cheesy at times in my experience this one lives up to the high standard which the other barbie princess movies have set for it i would recommend this to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess it teaches a good lesson as well everyone is special and different in their own way and everyone can make a difference
<START> i saw this movie yesterday and can't stop thinking about it i moved to norway four months ago and have tried ever since to find the origin of the strange emptiness i felt when i saw this film i was striken with the brilliant snapshot of this society yes this is all true i too found a great job with a great pay and i live with my norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment downtown but so far everyone i have met have left me with that tasteless empty feeling i had never had before this is what this movie is about dinner parties with nothing to say to each other but emotionless comments long silences no stress a creepy calm and frozen smiles of niceness this scandinavian nightmare is perfectly rendered in den see this movie
<START> simply beautiful one of the best mind umm screws in existence both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract moscow could learn a few things from the torture techniques in this film they could also do worse than hiring alan rickman five out of five stars and at present 1 20 2000 2 on my top 100 films of all time list
<START> i am surprised that there is confusion over the title of this film quite obviously it is an investigation into the nature of modern love it is suggesting that love is love while the going is good but one in which people reserve the right to put themselves first and if the going gets tough they get out and go onto something else br br this observation has generational implications as it is coming from generation x makes comment on generation x and in the end is aimed at generation x it expresses disappointment that love has transformed from that which the baby boomers the parents of generation x had engendered in their marriages and family lives and which gave generation x the innocent and bountiful childhood it ultimately enjoyed br br the generation x attitude to love is of course flippant but as decisions are made and commitments are broken the biggest casualty are the children of generation x this is made clear at the end of the film and was so pungent i took a week to recover from the shock i received from this epiphany
<START> spoilers br br oh sure it's based on moby dick totally obsessed and it destroy's him it's a total folly the movie starts off rather well but by the end of the film everyone else is destroyed and the main star's mind is a blank br br the supposed half sister is never convincing some very poor lighting effects music is interesting but little else it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing i suppose if you like being john malkovich you might like this but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didn't want to watch again x is a movie i just hate to high hell the only possible excitement in the film is the incest sexual scene towards the end of the film hopefully yer not thinking of catherine either br br this movie is severely boring depressing and poorly directed not highly recommended if if you like french movies go watch crimson rivers instead br br 4 10 br br quality 5 10 entertainment 1 10 replayable 0 10
<START> tyra the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something weird locations too much makeup too much skin is not necessary sex does not always sell when you are selling to women the same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural people come in all shapes sizes they need to have that on the show my daughter has a 36 is tall slender a size 5 i am more average at a size 12 we would like to see both i can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it it will not fit the same way on me i do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter we would really love the show to consider women of all sizes thank you
<START> this is one of the few movies of this type i have reviewed and enjoyed while clint eastwood is his usual self the overall story works well even in the limits of washington d c br br the theme an assassin is tracking the president and there is only one person who may save him br br it cannot be easy to make a film which audiences enjoy these days involving this arena this film succeeds on several levels eastwood is his usual underplayed hero wanting to save the president since the kennedy era he does well in this role as does his foil russo an fbi agent overall well done and suspenseful with extra stars for malkovich 9 10
<START> we open in a doctors room of some sort a girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor he asks her questions silence follows he continues to ask questions ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere br br the story is about two girls who are taken home after spending some time in a mental home after an 'incident' that happened before hand they are greeted on their arrival by their trying way too hard to be nice but so totally evil stepmother who the girls obviously hold resentment for as time goes on at home the evil stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls and to top it all off there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls' recovery br br this film is amazing it has twist turns and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense the relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming it almost makes you cry at some points i know i had a teary moment of two specifically 'the cupboard scene' but what i love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits the soundtrack is faultless the furnishings in the house and the use of colour are fantastic a pure joy for the eyes this is a definite must see for all asian movie fanatics or any sort of movie fan an easy 10 10
<START> once i heard that the greatest and oldest preserved germanic heroic poem was transformed into a film it almost became my obsession to see it the first glints of its appearance i caught never disappointed me a futuristic interpretation with lambert our favourite highlander and tomb raider to be in leading roles seamed appealing though some doubts came to life an important female character in beowulf two hours ago i saw the film after i had read the director's name my world fell apart as i said from that point on there was not many surprises first and foremost the film has nothing to do with the original beowulf if we disregard a couple of violently and pointlessly stolen names if they had not stolen the names and declared it to be a new story it might have passed as an f class action stupidity with nice costumes and scenography this way it is simply a crime an attack on a legend and its ideology as well as on common sense ok let me be positive for a second apart from the general electro goth atmosphere which is nice it also has good music that was it for both the positive part and this comment
<START> i saw this flick on the big screen as a kid and loved it and all recently i found a copy on video and checked it out again badly made sure schlocky fun most definitely it still packs an entertaining punch it's much more fun than the dull disney version alive the only thing alive did better were the special effects if you're a lover of b movies i highly recommend survive not to mention all the other rene cardona jnr movies and the mexican wrestling flicks made by his father rene cardona snr survive is long overdue for dvd special edition treatment are you listening all you kind folk at anchor bay
