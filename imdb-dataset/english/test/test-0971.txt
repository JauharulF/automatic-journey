<START> like most i thought 'another crocodile movie' so far we've had primeval and rogue in the last 12 months what can they do that's new where both those films were about action and violence this one's about fear and tension br br the performances aren't oscar worthy when there's nothing going on but in times of distress or terror these people suffer so much it's like torture there are holes in the plot and maybe crocs don't really behave like this as others have pointed out but the fear is so effective it's a stretch to say you'll enjoy this movie it'll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as the passion of the christ
<START> a remarkable film bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings i had when i was much much younger i loved it and the elton john music i remember seeing in in the movies when i was a kid and for some reason limited release i've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released br br the dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back i confess however that my kids in their 20's have not experienced a similar emotional rush a generational thing br br why is it not on dvd
<START> just once in a while you see a movie so mind numbingly awful that you have to comment on it this was that movie poorly scripted acted and totally unbelievable it's movies like these that show you how good the banal hollywood trash usually is
<START> quick summary of the book boy billy tepper about 12 years old is school's main trouble maker and if he gets kicked out of one more school he'll be sent off to boarding school his upscale boy's school in switzerland or somewhere like it gets taken over by arab terrorists why i'm not really sure billy has no friends and likes to use his laptop to hack into his school's database he with the help of two teachers thwarts the terrorists' plans and save the entire school the book wasn't bad but was sooooooo clichÃ© br br now about the movie they switched arab terrorists to cuban terrorists and make billy about 17 and the leader of his group of friends they like to get into trouble but normal teenage stuff this movie was believable maybe not realistic but the characters are real you can watch billy joey and the rest of the guys and see real kids acting out the way they did or at least wanting to br br great action scenes not everything goes as planned for either side overthrowing the terrorists was messy and good guys did get hurt i won't say who but it is heart wrenching i know i use that word a lot sean astin is excellent as a teenager he usually played the dopey best friend this movie proved once again that he could play the leading man kid whatever the only performance that may have upstaged his was wil who played the only son of a new jersey mafia man he hated his father and everything he stood for a far cry from wesley crusher usually this genre of film is one i watch for the soul purpose of making fun but not toy soldiers the story line flows the dialogue is usually believable i can't think of a single moment where i found myself shouting at the tv oh that would so not happen great movie that should be in everyone's collection
<START> the creepy demons the gentlemen capture the voice of the population of sunnydale to steal human hearts without scream find that in accordance with a legend if a lady screams the creatures will be destroyed but buffy and her friends including riley have to fight the monsters speechless br br hush is certainly the best episode of the fourth season of buffy up to this moment having lots of humor and funny situations i liked a lot spike is hilarious the romance between xander and anya is cool but i loved the intense dialog between buffy and riley in end the gothic scenario of the final battle against the gentlemen recalls the environment of dark city my vote is ten br br title brazil silence
<START> the revisionist history making the evil marquis de sade a semi heroic romantic is mind boggling enough but the atrocious acting amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad the only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous and amazingly being tortured for days with hands bound overhead apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty hairstyle and makeup my guess is that the producers filmed mostly in russia choosing women for their looks and willingness to work cheap rather than acting ability if you decide to watch this because you have nothing better to do or are a film student looking for bad examples fast forward through every scene not involving nudity
<START> i don't even like watching those late night talk shows but i found this one really interesting i imagine it's probably close to the truth it feels like an honest account if that means anything kinda feel for the people somewhat when you watch it a nice movie for a saturday night
<START> this is arguably the worst of the major ava gardner films yes she is gorgeous but that can wear thin over time especially after the corny and predictable movie ending br br in this turkey robert walker has to pretend that he's eddie bracken which surely embarrassed him olga san juan plays the jane powell golly gee part dick plays a sort of dim sidekick and eve arden plays helen broderick and a host of other wise cracking female semi comedians yes the film contains a major popular song speak low but check out the other entirely forgettable pieces dick sings very well of course and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for ava br br the sets are cheap the script is filled with clichÃ©s and failed humor and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor as indeed he was in short if you want to see ava in her prime buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie
<START> this was something i had been looking forward to seeing the ultimate avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since iron man has been one of my favorite marvel characters i thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an iron man solo title but the final film was unsatisfying i wasn't expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to iron man gray armor the red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together not a major complaint but not what i expected from the ads and box the worse thing however was the story the acting and the cell shaded cgi animation for the monsters and iron man armor that was not convincing it didn't blend in well with the cell animation at all even on it's own it seem stick like and lifeless tony character arc as incredibly slow as it takes is so forced and unconvincing i wanted to see this movie because i love iron man but after forcing myself through the film i wondered if they couldn't have come up with something that had been as good as the ultimate avengers movies
<START> having seen this without knowing all the hoopla surrounding the lead character indeed without even knowing that it was based on real life events i must say i am impressed murder in greenwich is an above average production for a made for tv movie the acting is uniformly great christopher meloni in particular putting in a stand out performance and the teen actors excel in what are difficult roles the idea of the dead girl narrating the movie is a stroke of genius which elevates the movie from merely good to excellent the script is exemplary for what is essentially movie of the week fodder and the cinematography is beautiful
<START> three is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie masquerading as a psychological thriller it's closest relative is the monumentally superior dead calm also featuring billy zane dead calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidman's grieving parents attempting to re define their relationship on an ocean cruise they end up being terrorised by zane's adrift psycho killer it provided sharp increasingly suspense a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded br br three suffers from poorly drawn characterisation the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding hammy performances from the principal players zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion in dead calm he was menacing wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence here he is bombastic petulant slimy and unravelled and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ms brook is very picturesque stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over inflated by some sort of life raft pump they do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her dramatic actress in the purest sense of the term she is not the guy playing the voodoo manuel the third component of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood no one would notice in fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes excuse pun br br plus sides the scenery is nice and the cinematography above and below the water is credible br br i'm guessing this had a very limited if any theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd the reason for this is it's not very good if you want something decent along these lines get dead calm it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema
<START> i have really nothing to add to all the other comments save this to me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound the text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression i suppose along the way the actors were allowed to leave the stilted theatre like acting marguerite churchill very much looks like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film but at the end is allowed finer expressions gus the swede reminded me of the comic characters of shakespeare plays and windy sounded to me like an early donald duck br br it truly amazed me that it was all filmed outdoors on location and even though the dust of all the wagons horses and cattle obscured the view it must actually have been like that for the real settlers it also was clear to me that many of those indians must have been real and i didn't detect any overt racism towards them and john wayne looks so incredibly young as someone who became a real wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by john ford and thought that stage coach was wayne's first as a leading star this film was a revelation the plot is very simple again reminding me of a silent film but the grit is very real indeed an amazing film to have been made with that technique and under those conditions in 1930
<START> i have the good common logical sense to know that oil cannot last forever and i am acutely aware of how much of my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemical products i've been an avid consumer of new technology and i keep running out of space on so i know that even the energy crunch associated with peak oil will change my life appreciably br br the end of suburbia shows in a rational and entertaining manner just how much my whole family's lifestyle will have to change in my lifetime i am particularly concerned for the future generations who will have to pick up the tab for our excesses however the film makers do offer a glimmer of hope in that they acknowledge human resourcefulness and determination and the sense of community that tends to be engendered by shared hardship br br there is no point in trying to pretend that peak oil is baseless propaganda or in treating it like the approaching radioactive cloud in on the beach i e with suicide pills at the ready even with our best efforts times will get harder all over and i'm hoping there's enough compassion and humanity to go around
<START> i absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist barbara stanwyck for a major magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful connecticut home the trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a ww2 hero as guests during the christmas holidays why is she worried because she lives in a small new york apartment isn't married and doesn't have a baby and can't cook at all hilarity and romance ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face keep from being fired by the magazine owner played by sydney greenstreet this is a delightful comedy one that i highly recommend to classic movie lovers
<START> admittedly i tuned into this in the hopes of seeing some beefcake shots of james brolin unfortunately there was only one early on and the rest of the movie was very tame and ultimately made little sense br br the story what there is of it centers on nick and julie atkins a couple whose marriage of many years is beginning to grow stale nick a successful businessman is focused on work to the point of neglecting julie who tries to fill the void by going back to school julie's longing for the passion that she and nick had early in their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies which block out reality for minutes at a time causing her to do things like burning breakfast and her husband's papers at first she fantasizes about her husband but as the movie progresses she begins to fantasize about other men and about encounters with random strangers whom she meets this culminates in her acting out her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage can she and her husband rebuild their relationship is it worth saving br br this could have been an interesting premise but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they even bothered characters aren't developed motives aren't explained background information isn't given no exploration is made of how julie got to the point where she couldn't control herself and no explanation is offered as to how she will do so in the future the end product is a muddled mess which is just as confusing as julie's fantasies which are surprisingly underdeveloped br br the acting is a mixed bag donna mills as julie does well with the material she is given although her continual self pity does become strident after awhile james brolin acts as though he is reading his lines from cue cards and even his anger over his wife's infidelity is hard to buy into he shows so little passion over the whole issue the supporting roles are mostly forgettable br br disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story more's the pity since it doesn't even offer the eye candy it promised
