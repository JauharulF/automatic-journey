<START> the video opens with a scene from a horror movie in which a man proposes to his girlfriend he begins to tell her that he is different as the full moon rises he morphs into a werewolf he then pursues her through the woods and right before he attacks we're taken to the inside of the movie theater inside the theater are michael and his girlfriend she's too scared to watch any longer so they leave as they exit the theater he begins to tease her it's close to midnight something lurking in the dark michael then sings and dances his way down the street with his girlfriend this scene shows michael's skill with the camera he never once acts aware of its presence as many other artists do as they make there way past the graveyard the graves begin to open once they arrive at an alley they are confronted with a horde of the undead we then see the horror stricken face of michael's girl who wouldn't have a horror stricken look if their date morphed into a zombie yep he becomes one of the undead a very bright and shiny one though he and his fellow zombies then begin what may be the most well known dance choreography of any music video to tell you any more would give the ending away br br this is my favorite music video of all time you don't want to miss it i give it a 10 10 yes i know you can see the curtains in the back of the sound stage and the werewolf looks kind of cheesy by today's standards
<START> the big trail 1930 released 10 24 1930 viewed 4 5 06 br br births richard harris harold pinter robert atkins br br doug in hollywood raoul walsh unveiled his latest film the big trail a western about the trek west across the frontier starring up and coming 23 year old actor john wayne in 1930 we are seeing many firsts but few bests besides the first john wayne film we have here the first widescreen film although we only watched the full frame version interestingly the decision to film in widescreen was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later to compete with television which hadn't yet appeared commercially but was still an emerging curiosity all the same this film was extremely good giving us a harrowing look at the trek to oklahoma the opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kind about america about the land who should live on it etc and is an excellent demonstration of that walsh gives us some astonishing visuals of the wagon company out in the wilderness when they reach a cliff they must rope each wagon down one by one and we also get a revenge subplot involving wayne pursuing the man who killed one of his friends i seem to recall something similar in stagecoach wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partly there and would surely evolve further in subsequent films since this film is representing all of wayne's early 30's work for the odyssey we will not see his face again until stagecoach but once we do we will keep seeing him to the end of the odyssey and beyond br br kevin ah our first sound western and john wayne's first starring role it's raoul walsh's the big trail this review will be short since it's been weeks since i watched it i enjoyed this movie but it was far from a masterpiece the mostly predictable adventure had a few surprises like when the brains of the bad guys red flack tyrone power sr in his last role is killed half way through i thought he would be the boss at the end but that ended up being bill ian keith i remember that i didn't like the way breck wayne kills and exacts revenge at the end i understood that that's what he was meant to do in the story but i really didn't like his reasoning when he tells ruth why he has to do it i think he had a far greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he was leading through the harsh west br br last film viewed animal crackers 1930 last film chronologically soup to nuts 1930 next film l'age d'or 1930
<START> outdoes himself as writer director actor in his indie production about a big guy wandering around chicago with an eye for every woman he sees the laughs keep coming almost every minute it's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love but done with great comedic writing and acting the supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich br br rose is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film sara silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with jeff bonnie hunt is classically great in her role i only wish there was more of her in the film as i think most will agree it's certainly refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfit br br david was the aloof detached sidekick and voice of reason mina kolb plays jeff's mother who he lives with there were numerous other cameos all of them done very well br br at the premier jeff mentioned his inability to do more with bonnie due to production issues still it's good to leave you wanting more i think it's that indie thing of keeping some things ambiguous to let the audience do some thinking for themselves to fill in the blanks the wordy title should clue you in to this br br jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his past relationships this explains why they work so well real life people are always unusually colorful and makes great characters he departs quite a bit from what you might expect having seen curb your enthusiasm and some of his other work it's one of those break out things where an actor takes some risks to do something they maybe always wanted to do but couldn't br br i think it's noteworthy that improv second city background and hunt's for that matter set the style here of acting being the focus of the story and the directing it's perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improv meets indie film making
<START> has the drama suspense and character developments you would enjoy if you like drama that engages you and entertains as well as educates br br the writers know their material and it shows the direction is always engaging and not blase and the acting terrific why this show didn't win any awards tells me the powers that be in hollyweird don't know drama or much else for that matter br br there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out i'm glad it wasn't used as a shock scene for any climatic end to this series which would have been more typical and dull rent this series at once let's hope its brought back from celluloid extinction
<START> i don't have a really solid thesis here so i'm just going to toss out some observations br br first of all the film is absolutely gorgeous it's shot in high contrast black and white and some of the scenes are so well composed that they're almost distracting br br there's a sequence early on of some intense protests and some of the shots were amazing three guys launching tear gas at the protesters etc br br second of all i think that one of the biggest signs that this is a recent film looking back on the 60's is that it's really about how the idealism of the revolution morphed and shifted into something different the take on this shift is really interesting i think that both the political phase of things as well as the artistic and more self indulgent phase have strong points and weak points the film doesn't necessarily take the position that things decayed br br third i think the romance works very well br br finally i really really really hated the ending it was way too melodramatic you could even say that the ending is unworthy of the film that preceded it
<START> look i've come to expect this level of acting from william macy the guy just keeps putting in terrific performances but meat loaf just when did his decide to leave jim behind and throw his decidedly lower weight around in the wonderful world of stanislavsky well what can i say i'm duly impressed to paraphrase an old adage it ain't the meat it's the emotion and the loaf is quietly buffing up his acting chops of late br br laura dern carries off the 40's look perfectly here great job by the costume and hair departments david paymer is typecast but right on the money solid camera work throughout the flick the plot line is reminiscent of gentleman's agreement post wwii anti semitism well worth your time particularly for the growing legions of bill macy acolytes br br
<START> or safe journey is the second film in tony trilogy of the romany people the film is a visual depiction and historical record of romany life in european and middle eastern countries even though the scenes are mostly planned rehearsed and staged there is not a conventional story line and the dialog does not explain activities from scene to scene instead the film allows the viewer to have sometimes a glimpse sometimes a more in depth view of these people during different eras and in different countries ranging from india egypt romania hungary france and spain br br the importance of music in romany culture is clearly expressed throughout the film it is a vital part of every event and an important means of communication everything they do is expressed with music dance is another important activity like romany music it is specialized and deeply personal something they alone know how to do correctly we are provided glimpses into their everyday activities but the film is not a detailed study of their lives rather it is a testament to their culture focusing on the music and dance they have created and which have made them unique br br mr portrays the nomadic groups in a positive way however we also witness the rejection distrust and alienation they receive from the non romany population it seems that the culture they have developed over countless generations and inspired from diverse countries will fade into oblivion because conventional society has no place for nomadic ways br br the other films in the trilogy are les princes 1983 and 1998
<START> a pointless cash in with nothing to contribute except nastiness this is a definite case of sloppy seconds for robocop irvin numbing plot less and tired mess of a sequel is watchable and even mildly entertaining in a dubious unpleasantly trashy way but it has virtually none of the original's flair emotion intelligence or excitement instead we have just another empty spectacle of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to the viewer with relentless violence which is far more brainlessly gratuitous than anything in the original omni consumer products who made the original robocop cyborg have turned into more of a totalitarian force than ever second time round what with the suspicious nazi esquire banners guards and tanks for hire at the end as for the anonymous old man daniel o' herlihy he's less of a benevolent protector and more of a hideous mr burns type surrounding himself with moronic lackeys who genuinely believe that putting the brain of a murderous psychopath into the body of the all new robocop 2 is a good idea oh and the first robocop gets a look in somewhere amidst all of this mess though you wonder what on earth a fine actor like peter weller saw in the script the droll tom noonan has nothing to work with as the villain while nancy allen is badly wasted as partner there are some hilarious moments throughout the opening commercial for instance but this is a poor follow up to the truly great original
<START> rainy day with not much to do we were surfing the movie network channels and found this one just starting so we gave it a chance br br the more we watched the more we became engrossed in the story its the old story of working class underdog trying to make it in a sport which at the time 1913 i think was usually played by the wealthy upper class but this movie was every bit as interesting as and this is also based on a true story br br the acting is believable and the casting is brilliant and we are not golfers so please don't miss this one just because its about golf any individual sport would serve the plot because it's about the people golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the game br br bottom line its a feel good movie it's well put together and isn't it always fun to see those who think they are better than others get taken down a peg or two
<START> i haven't laughed so much in a theater in years the only problem is that it was not the intent of the movie to make my throat raw from laughter br br this movie is absolutely overflowing with bad cgi absolutely terrible duologue absolutely terrible acting and enough geek references to make the whole thing come off as nothing but complete cheese br br as a gamer and a geek type girl myself i did recognize all of the obvious game references in this movie as well as the geek stuff that was just thrown into the background as eye candy the poster the t shirts from com and j list com and that didn't redeem the movie at all br br the only thing that might have been good at all were the ghost children type characters that were purposefully badly done in cgi to make it look like they were from a game and who were obviously stolen from japanese horror movies br br to be honest it was hilariously bad and something i'd expect from a midnight showing of a made for tv b grade sci fi channel movie don't expect more than that and you'll have a great time just don't get a soda or you'll spit it everywhere when you get great lines like why did you bring that game into our lives why
<START> i very much enjoyed bruce almighty but the minute i found out that there was going to be a sequel without jim carey i knew it was bad although steve carell was hysterical in the first film the babbling scene is one of my favorites and in my opinion deserves an emmy for his role in the office he is pretty weak in this dull comedy i'm curious how much work the script writers put because we could just as well do without the story but even if we discard the huge plot holes why did elephants and lions come to aid evan when the flood only concerned that particular area of washington the film is simply not funny i did not laugh once and as far as i remember a comedy is supposed to make you laugh or giggle at least not this one br br there is small hope however evan almighty has family written all over it and maybe a family viewing might be enjoyable kids might be entertained by the variety of animals and the silly jokes but for me evan almighty simply doesn't cut it br br i give it a 4 10 and hope that carell will be more careful when choosing his roles in the feature
<START> this is the ultimate of horror movies this year house of wax is one of the scariest movies i've ever seen this version really puts the vincent price version of the movie to shame i only know a few of the young cast in the movie the ever troublesome paris hilton the pain in the you know what seems to be more seductive than ever at least she didn't try to copy her infamy well if she likes to do horror she's better than wheel of white she beats hands down and the scene of where house of wax was made was no joke the house was made of wax and the victims were able to get out of there before the get waxed like their friends those two twins bo and vincent the deformed twins were maniacs from the get go the parents raised them well except for vincent and i think they became equally warped how come the the one in the other pick up happen to be creepy but not as bad as the other two that's another story in the book i guess he had to follow his heart and not the other twins who turned ambrose into a tourist trap for unsuspecting victims this movie is like the phantom of the opera meets the rocky horror picture show and this movie is one of the scariest one in 2005 rating 4 out of 5 stars
<START> i tried to like this movie i love kevin spacey and i knew the other guy from his role as big brain on brad in pulp fiction but i just didn't care about the characters at all kevin spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him i didn't like him especially the ending that made me hate him even more this was like watching a bad car wreck spacey played a prick well he does it all well but other than that i don't recommend it
<START> in this film gary oldman plays a defense attorney who was formerly a prosecutor he is a bit tormented but is more or less playing a regular guy rather than some sort of figurative or literal monster funny thing is he doesn't quite pull it off i guess you can't quite get to normal from there kevin bacon was sufficiently creepy the scene in the park was way too long with way too many false scares and the odd sex scene with oldman and karen young seemed to have come from a different movie although the rest of the time miss young did just fine this film suffers from oddness trying to cover up the predictability and failing don't bother
<START> i agree with the user that this episode is awful thr worst of the entire show now i'm not keen on many episodes of the later series but this one takes the biscuit it was unfunny and as for the ending i'm sorry but it disgusted me more than any other episodes combined br br i mean the boys think they meant well but the ending was so upsetting that they think the whale belongs on the moon and over the credits we see it has died could have saved the episode was if the pranksters were able to confess for what they did br br there seem to be no outgoing message okay south park may be guilty of preaching too much and its always nice to see an one such as make love not but this episode was just wrong avoid at all costs helen
