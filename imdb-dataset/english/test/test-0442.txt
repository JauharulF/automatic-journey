<START> br br br br 5 years ago if you were to watch an australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters stories of war drag queens and and australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land saying words like and generally being the classic underdog br br luckily australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day such as moulin rouge chopper boy and sample people br br in this evolution of film we also find two hands br br set in kings cross two hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town played by bryan brown is a sydney mob boss he's the king of organised crime wearing thongs carrying a stubby and helping his son with his origami he's vicious but real as are his holding gun's to someone's head in one scene and then playing in the next they are well respected and if they ask you for a favour you don't say no br br enter jimmy played by heath ledger jimmy is your average aussie guy in his early twenties he's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on anyone's bad side so when asks jimmy to deliver 10 000 jimmy accepts br br things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal the money while jimmy is at the beach so now jimmy is 10 000 in dept to a major mob boss from here we start to see all the interconnecting stories with jimmy and his attempt at a bank robbery to recover the money jimmy and alex the love interest played by rose byrne trying to find jimmy and of course the two teenagers and their new found prosperity the concept is deepened by the narrator jimmy's dead brother michael who was killed by and his gang years earlier br br in the end all the storylines connected really well with a surprise twist to shock and stun the audience i thoroughly enjoyed it br br
<START> i've enjoyed this movie ever since i first saw it in the theatre some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy and this is one of them the characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people working together harmoniously building a team and achieving goals without ever preaching morality the situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise the tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout the movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters and to laugh pretty well all the way through this is a feel good movie as good as they come br br what amazes me is that a movie which appears so simple can be so long term entertaining the music is a perfect copy of music in the typical serious post war navy movies which helps to create the humor and point out that greatness is in the eye of the beholder the scenes in the credits are a great music video of in the navy which deserve their own full screen special feature the scenes and cuts are crafted well and the casting and acting is right on br br this movie is a classic as great as any ever made without any pretensions in fact the lack of pretension is what makes it so much fun to watch i love these guys and gal br br the other day i thought of the film and wondered whether it was available on dvd good fortune has come to us and the dvd came out in may 2004 i headed to the store and snapped up a copy then my wife and i enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen i've rated this movie as a 10 because it comes together on all levels far better than many high budget films and oscar winners this is entertainment br br listen up fox home video you have a great movie in your vaults and it's a shame to find a cheap shot dvd with badly degraded off tint colors only 8 years since release so why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen i'd gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right i'm grateful to have my own copy now give us the eye candy that the film deserves and how about recreating the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature
<START> i agree with the aussie's comments for the most part however there id seem to be a fairly decent plot if unoriginal christina kelli inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge she gets reacquainted with chip bobby johnston whom she had known when she was growing up in there the plot thickens when james paul logan arrives with his new stripper friend lane because christina had been james' stripper friend in years gone by and the implication is that james had done her wrong somehow to add interest to the movie sophia linn monique parent a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge as do eric sebastien guy and linda flower pair of lawyers from the city james the local building codes inspector on business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down so the question is how far will james go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed br br watch for lane here and in beauty betrayed she seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the r world another notable is samantha mcconnell playing the role of bait clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies
<START> i know if i was a low budget film maker i would probably be checking this page to find out what people are saying about it so i really hope the creators of the movie actually read this i think you should find a way to repay me for the hour and a half of life i just wasted watching this garbage please stop making movies about something you probably fantasize about just stop making movies all together you are one of the reasons it is so hard for indie filmmakers to make it big do the world a favor and get a job a mcdonalds or something so you can do something productive with your life i feel like calling blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this film in their store
<START> a movie about a french girl who gets raped by street hoodlums the rape scene itself is shot in all it's gory detail with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera in a fit of rage the victim grabs her friend's or was it brother gun shoots him and runs off with the weapon she meets this prostitute who has just seen her pimp shot down they team up and make off towards paris a series of crazy meaningless and wild killings follow the girls seem to enjoy every murder more than the one before one poor guy gets shot in the hole there are good doses of sex thrown in between the numerous killings br br the movie is not the most violent i have seen i would say saving private ryan probably had more violence in it if violence is what you are looking for then there are lots of other movies out there and if it's sex you are out for then i would suggest one of those xxx ones br br i went to see the movie because of all the hype the media was giving it the movie itself is no big deal just a lot of violence and sex shot with something like a hand held camera i was surprised this movie had a 15 year age limit in sweden if 15 year olds can watch this movie they should be able to watch xxx movies too
<START> ok chuck norris has shown up in many an entertaining movie over the years this is not one of them i won't even bother trying to get into the plot about a bible shipment gone wrong the acting of the main characters is so wood like pinocchio would have done a better job the synthesizer based soundtrack is even worse than the one in deathstalker whereas traditionally low budget spooky movies are often trying to catch their audience by adding plenty of graphic violence this one is trying to catch an audience by throwing religious mambo jumbo at the spectator the plot boils down to different versions of the bible
<START> anderson's animation easily rivals that of pixar and goes well beyond most anything i've ever seen disney do while some say the story is a bit too abstract i find it a thought provoking and refreshing change from the exaggerated characters and bumbling animals typically found in animated shorts it's an interplanetary version of castaway anyone who has left the safe harbor of home and gone off to a lonely frightening place by themselves will readily identify with this forlorn excellent work mr anderson br br
<START> my mother and i rented this gem a few years ago while she was here visiting for thanksgiving i have rarely laughed so hard this is a typical low budget horror movie with dumb special effects a worse plot and even worse acting but are you really expecting a classic when linnea quigley receives top billing i thought not br br since this movie does have some entertainment value i give it a 3 out of 10
<START> this is one of the worst mini series i have ever seen on tv i sat through the first half hoping it would improve but it only went from bad to worse needless to say i could not bring myself to sit through the torture of a second nights viewing what was jon voight thinking when he made this
<START> so we saw this on dvd at our apartment here in paris we're all here on an exchange program we all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us i mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichÃ©d but still true know what i'm saying br br i think i related more to the quiet guy the italian than xavier because i'm more of the observer in our group anyway i wish i had a hot roommate like cecile de france she seems like a cool chick in the movie and for real after i saw her hosting the cannes festival last month br br now i'm thinking i wanna go to barcelona next summer after seeing this movie i gotta check out the sequel too which just came out here in france
<START> the story is derived from king lear the setting is a farm in iowa here's a test for this kind of thing if you find yourself asking why did so and so do such and such and the answer is because that's what happened in 'king you know that the film has failed well that is what happens here the father figure in this story isn't living his own life he's mimicking a fictional one but there's more wrong with the film than this br br jocelyn is ambitious far more ambitious than i think she realises she's trying to take the king lear story and completely change the setting this is a task in itself the result is that the transplanted story will die and nobody will quite be able to work out why although there are enough successful transplants like west side story to make it worth trying but she's also attempting a revisionist retelling in the version of king lear she wishes to create reagan and command our sympathy and is a villain this is a task in itself too br br succeeding at either task is hard succeeding at both at once is impossible in fact succeeding at one while so much as attempting the other is impossible if we are to look on the very same events from a different moral perspective then the events must be the very same events which means there can be no tampering with setting if the story is to be transplanted alive into a different setting its moral heart must keep beating the whole while which means there can be no tampering with ethical perspective was bound to fail in not just one but in both of her endeavours and so she did naturally it's possible to attempt both tasks fail at both tasks yet by some fluke hit upon a work of art that's good for independent reasons i mention this because i haven't read jane smiley's novel which for all i know is good for independent reasons but the film isn't if there was nothing else wrong with it there would still be no getting around the fact that it's just so thoroughly excruciatingly dull the very fields of corn are even more boring than they would be in real life which needn't be the case since off the top of my head i can think of four films the wizard of oz north by northwest the straight story in which the cornfields aren't boring at all
<START> i thought that one dark night was great it deserves a 10 as to a statement made by one user the dead were actually zombies in this movie a dead person brought back to life is a zombie regardless of the method or cause for of being brought back to life the zombies in this movie are used to frighten the girls not to feed off of them like traditional zombies this movie is a definite star among horror flicks of the 80's the score and atmosphere are quite eerie and the audience is kept in suspense throughout the mausoleum scenes the acting is actually convincing with genuine expressions of horror at the sight of the undead although i enjoy all zombie flicks this movie is a refreshing change from the typical flesh eating zombie movie
<START> this stinker is in mystifyingly frequent rotation on one channel here and i've found myself watching in horror again and again the script is like something one would come up with friends over several too many drinks and the production values match admirably br br it's meant to be a children's movie but features a grotesque and poorly explained kidnapping scene the star dog has a lack of star quality equaled only by the other actors and it in general has the look of being filmed in someone's backyard the climactic soccer game features no more than three dozen extras sadly cheering in the background br br it even all wraps up with a budget ran out voice over sequence when the story to one's relief simply stops the high raters here must be either the producers or the majority of the extras from the soccer game
<START> what can you say about a film that makes the erotic witch project look like the english patient again the plot and characters are secondary but the plot is almost an exact copy of br br four buxom sorority sisters and a goofy male guide enter a forest to look for the bare wench and the women become sexually charged the bare wench leaves porno devices and a blow up doll just like in they get lost the doofus gets lost and the girls find their way back to their hotel there they reenact the end of the blair witch project as cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing a game integral to the thin plot br br at least three of the sorority sisters here have unnaturally large breasts full of dimples and stretch marks along with the rather obvious surgery scars the one natural gal here is humiliated by the director in a very unfunny and overlong end credit segment outtake scenes where she could not get a line right is played over and over again ad nauseum br br julie strain shows up in a fright wig to play the bare wench this one scene seems to be added later since no one could possibly be credited in the cast with shooting it in the background as the women cavort and stroke you can see someone's picket fence this may be director jim backyard br br this is just bad stuff the lesbian love scenes are kelvin degrees cooler than the erotic witch most of the lovin' consists of the four women mashing their eight collective breasts together i think they are trying to form a silicone based that would rescue them from this bad career decision no such luck if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then the makers of the blair witch project should be really really mad br br this is unrated and contains mild physical violence strong profanity female nudity sexual content and sexual references br br
<START> a young frenchman himself as he becomes an erasmus exchange student in barcelona and comes back a better man sounds boring no way the movie is filled with colourful people all of them stereotypes the british and her racist brother the sexually liberated dane the ultra organised german in this case though the stereotypes are brilliantly done you feel like you know people like that i for one know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife and they're just like the characters in the film they feel like real people br br go see this movie and enjoy the subtitles
