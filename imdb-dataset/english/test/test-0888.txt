<START> i thought it was brilliant it was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down dwight schultz still looked the same he had hardly changed in looks neither had dirk benedict he still looked just as dishy i thought that mr t looked thinner though but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time i thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast such as the one who played decker and the lady who played amy it was just a shame that mr t could'nt make the actual reunion also it was a great shame that george peppard had died thereby leaving a gap so to speak i only wish now that i had taped it to keep let's hope that they repeat it again

<START> have you ever found yourself watching a film or documentary and having to hold yourself back from screaming things like no don't do it no well it's time you do and undoubtedly deep water is the one to get you started br br the story is based on that of donald and his entry into the first round the world yacht race to be undertaken by individuals in 1968 that word individuals is important as the men who set off on this nearly suicidal escapade head out alone br br most of the men are well knowns in the sea faring communities of england where they launch from but one of them is the unknown dark horse and his name was donald struggling financially enlists a backer who can take everything from him should he fail to at least attempt to make it through a large portion of the race he could take his home his property everything br br now finds himself between a rock and well deep water either attempt the race with an unproven ship and an unproven captain or lose everything you own which was significant since had a wife and several children you'll note the term unproven captain in there too not only was he unproven he'd never been out on the open sea did i mention suicidal flicking between archival footage of the pre and post race and those of friends family and acquaintances of today deep water is put together masterfully initially seen as a poor sap who got in over his head the film gradually shows you the limited choices had after months and months out on the water his ship leaks equipment breaks psyche stretched to the breaking point and beyond finds himself lost in an internal struggle with no successful way out it is interesting too to see the psychological breaks that other racers have as they deal with their solitary confinement on board their respective boats br br the wave like emotions that you'll feel as you watch this astounding documentary may make you a bit ill not unlike trying to get your sea legs and you'll probably be frustrated at the choices being made perhaps just as frustrated as poor mr br br the ending is also amazing in that we get to see the actual ship that sailed sitting deserted and rotting on a caribbean beach not unlike other things that felt deserted and rotting toward the end of this poorly thought out race br br incredible
<START> i didn't like as good as it gets very much but i am a big fan of william hurt and holly hunter's work so i decided to watch this movie and the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of albert brooks here in spain he's little known and only as a 2nd division version of woody allen in the west coast he played a great part but hunter and hurt were good too specially hurt in an relatively unusual role for him hunter played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in once around lasse 1991 br br finally the rest of the cast is great too robert one of these familiar faces of the american cinema the ex bond girl lois chiles pretty good placed on that role i think the always perfect joan cusack in her early years and specially the brief of jack nicholson maybe he doesn't have any good scene but it's jack nicholson anyway the best movie by james l brooks great story well resolved and superb cast for one of the surely best movies of the 80's
<START> the expert starring jeff speakman is the definition of dull br br dull characters dull situations dull direction dull actors dull cinematography dull music br br i don't really understand this movie is it supposed to be an action movie it's almost as if speakman wanted to be in a serious movie but the level of acting and writing found in the expert is below your average tv drama and there are some typical speakman pummeling bad guys scenes here and there but the main aspect of the movie relies on some sort of believable drama which is totally wrong for speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with the action star in the end this confused movie looks and feels very nondescript and bland the worst aspect of the expert is the music the composer is a jerry goldsmith wannabe with his pompous and melodramatic score which simply doesn't belong in this kind of dull movie it's as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film feel more compelling and dramatic with his score which makes the entire movie look even more confused goofier and dull br br don't waste your time watching this even if you're a jeff speakman fan
<START> here in germany king of queens has a big big cult status nearly every teenager and adults watch this sitcom it's really awesome better than the other horrible american sitcoms like full house or set by step the only series who is still ok is al bundy there haven't been an amercian sitcom in europe who was as effective as this really funny show kevin james and leah as doug carrie are the craziest couple i know jerry stiller as arthur is the funniest grandpa i know and victor williams and especially patton as deacon spence are the most different but funny guys i know i watch it as often as i could and i still haven't enough good humor
<START> i purchased this film on dvd for Â£4 but it was a waste the film is very bad the plot is your average monster film where it kills a few people the mayor chief doesn't believe it and they fight it at the end br br on the plus side the film quality is very good and the setting of new york is impressive for a budget film as opposed to a small coastal town the acting is reasonable too br br however the special effects in a monster film are laughable and the addition of a random bus load of kids to the plot half way through just gets weird the ending is just bad br br in summary whenever you have a chance to see this don't there will be something better on br br r t c true horror films don't have a pg rating
<START> after a couple years of searching for the humphrey bogart film two against the world it unexpectedly showed up as a tcm offering under the title one fatal hour a first national film from 1936 bogey's character is sherry scott the man who runs a radio station whose program lineup is losing listeners the owner bertram reynolds robert is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station but hides behind his decisions by pawning them off on scott br br in an effort to boost the audience base and revenues reynolds has the idea of reviving a twenty year old murder case and offering it as a fifteen chapter radio play scott enlists the aid of dr martin leavenworth harry hayden to write the play and present it on the air br br the murder case involved a woman who was acquitted of murdering her husband the circumstances of which are not made clear however gloria has married and is now living as martha helen married to a successful banker henry o'neill and their daughter edith linda perry is about to be married on the same day no less as the radio play is to reveal the identity of gloria about to be faced with the devastating effects of this revelation martha and jim embark on a crusade to have the program stopped simultaneously edith's future in laws respond by demanding that the marriage not take place br br without revealing the final outcome the film takes a devastating turn to jolt the viewer edith confronts the principals of the radio station vigorously admonishing scott and the sniveling reynolds while accepting his share of the blame for the outcome scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job firing his secretary and hauling her out of the office recognizing her for the conscience he once had with an entirely abrupt finish the film leaves one as disoriented and unsettled as any movie that doesn't have a happy ending br br with about a dozen films under his belt humphrey bogart gets a chance to take center stage here with intriguing results with no name supporting players bogey rises to the occasion by taking charge in the confines of the radio offices and runs the show as if it was his own in an interesting bit of characterization he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands over his bowed head predating by a half dozen years a similar effect we'll see him do in casablanca for bogart fans it's a genuine treat to catch an unexpected nuance like this
<START> i own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with patti and george with the san francisco symphony orchestra george is fantastic in my book as are angela lansbury and the composer stephen sondheim this musical is operatic in scope and shows much ingenuity in composition i certainly hope that this vhs becomes available on dvd performance is spookily sympathetic the one annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of joanna i believe this performance was at the dorothy chandler in los angeles rather than on a broadway stage and am not sure that the minimalist set was utilized in new york as it was in this production but i found the scaffolding being dragged across the stage to be quite effective to portray the streets of london i highly recommend this movie
<START> ostensibly hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother a nagging wife and a lover's rejection and despite the complex portrayal hans himself doesn't precisely make these claims the above must be a substantial part of fassbinder's thinking as well his use of freud and marx but the viewer may look no further than gender and sexism to locate the truer cause of his crushed spirit br br first it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into signing up with the foreign legion it was far more likely and is in part indicated that it was a quest for adventure male camaraderie escape from the female world of mother and sister and male identity itself which both the legion and war offered br br second hans loses his successful job as a policeman because of his own sexism by falling for a prostitute's wiles at work he not only rubber stamps prostitution as an oppressive institution but shows that he cannot even control his sexuality in a professional arena and is even willing to jeopardize a desirable career br br third he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheep like male buddies making no distinction at all between her absence or when she shows up looking for him presence in fact he is more brutal in her presence br br a few hours later in a violent and drunken state he beats his wife in front of their daughter who intervenes on her mother's behalf the terror he instills in her and his daughter are palpable but both he and the audience move on with nary a whimper of conscience or protest why because his wife is cruelly characterized as both nagging and sexually promiscuous yes this this may be fassbinder's view of what capitalism does to women owned insecure and a commodity but this hardly brutality nor fassbinder's exploitation of her in the battery scene br br and then there is this male role pressure which hans could choose to reject and protest but instead accepts he's too short for a male and too un heroic to achieve the worldly success the male role recommends but how can these be causes of despair when he not only gains his lost love as a mistress but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than himself finally hans allows harry his war comrade to remain over his wife's convincing plea to the contrary on in their house by this decision he not only makes it clear that he is more tied to harry than to his wife but that male bonding supersedes his love of women and supersedes in the end his own life because it is harry's superior competence and spirit around the house that causes star to fall hans the merchant may be to a degree the victim of capitalism but more to the point he is the victim of his own allegiance to his own male identity his inability to let it go is the ultimate cause for his isolation and despair br br this is something that is lost i think not only on fassbinder but also on han's sister anna although only to a degree lost for anna's and fassbinder's support of her brother over her mother only goes so far she is quite insistent that only he can save himself that her support and love cannot it itself end his self loathing unfortunately she does not offer any of this same support and love for his wife who must be much more embittered than hans but who in the end is able to pick up the pieces and save herself and daughter and present a marked contrast to han's fall
<START> walter matthau is wonderful as the philandering dentist dr julian winston whose frequent to girlfriend goldie provide textbook proof of the dangers of lying goldie hawn's touching kook toni simmons certainly deserved to win her oscar ingrid bergman's work as the stiff as nurse stephanie is also touching to watch as she comes out of her shell slowly and nervously this is a great movie to watch in the springtime or any time for that matter it's very underrated i never heard about it until i found it in the video store and what a find
<START> the dvd movie the tempest directed by jack bender was published in 2001 it didn't make its way to german cinemas and neither the director or an actor were able to receive an important award for this movie the movie refers to the shakespearean play the tempest which was published at the end of the 16th century the director tried to create an modern version of this play but failed at the beginning of the movie the plantation owner prosper gets in a conflict with his brother antonio about the treatment of their slaves antonio sets his brother a trip and tries to kill him but with the help of a witch prosper is able to escape and flees with his daughter and a slave called ariel to a small island nearby the mississippi river for over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island till a lucky chance enables him to take revenge on his brother if prosper will be lucky you have to find out by yourself br br in my opinion this film is really a bad try to create a modern version of the original play by william shakespeare the story of the movie is confusing as well as the characters prosper doesn't have the same powers as in the tempest end of part i
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen what were they thinking stop preaching to me already this is why all of us watch walker texas ranger and wont admit it to our friends terrible acting and a extremely phony plot while the movie is unfolding the story stops and the actors start preaching to the audience the director somehow believed the two meshed well it looked like crap when i saw the title at my local blockbusters it looked interesting their should have been a warning on it saying it was religious instead of the false advertisement of an action adventure first time in a long time i stopped a movie and couldn't tolerate finishing it
<START> though i strongly feel that is the best gene kelly movie but this a pretty good one i liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how gene got the girl my favorite part though without a doubt is gene's dance with his alter ego i love watching two gene kelly's for the price of one it shows what talent mr kelly really was it is a movie that i think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time so you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today i'm sure that everyone out there has a gene kelly friend that has this movie in their collection so go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy
<START> certainly this film has the ring of truth about it as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a marine base it deals with the attempted cover up by the local marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend a marine captain the man and woman had been lovers but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married he continued to stalk her going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time finally he broke into her home attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed the civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense but the marines decided to charge the captain with murder the major you see was a decorated hero from vietnam and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the marine base the captain too had made some enemies in her motor pool command rejecting some male advances in a very butch style br br there is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama which the very capable cast gets across nicely the director and editor however seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view you're lucky if you know where you're at most of the time bear with them though it's a worthwhile story as the captain's court martial trial unfolds and it seems every man's hand is against her even her attorney at times br br the verdict well after all this is rather a suspense story so you'll have to see for yourself there is a kind of pacifist message folded into the film but forget about that sure war is hell but sometimes it can't be avoided we'll need those marines then even if they aren't always the best champions of fair play internally as kipling says in his poem tommy atkins br br it's tommy this and tommy that and tommy wait outside but it's room for mr atkins when the on the tide
