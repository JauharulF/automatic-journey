<START> if you're a long time fan of the doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series rest easy it more than meets the high expectations of the original the pacing is much quicker than the original shows fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes the writing is excellent the acting superb the hardest and best thing to get used to is the production values of the new series compared to the original it's got some now although i will always have fond memories of bubble wrap and hand puppet monsters if you're not a fan or if you tried the original and couldn't get a handle on it jump in with both feet now everything you really need to know about the doctor they'll tell you as they go along this series was written with minimal references to the doctor's enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers admittedly i'm only seeing the first new series now as it's being shown on the sci fi channel in other words probably cut to ribbons for time constraints but i'm looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast tv or on dvd july 4th can't come soon enough
<START> this is a new barbie movie the graphics were really good they made the movie seem partially realistic i used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it this movie was kind of like a cinderella movie but a little bit different a father of 12 princesses gets very sick his cousin poisons him and wants the throne the girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories its up to them to save their father and society with the help of their handsome prince it was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it we enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the indian talking parrot the music was very nice and made the movie even greater it had a great classical orchestra the voices were great and the characters were adorably sweet and cute i liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family all in all i'd watch it again
<START> after watching desperate living i was hooked on john waters films i heard about pink flamingos and had to watch it and boy was it worth it believe what you hear it is trash it is packed with everything filthy which is actually the main plot of this film it contains the following incest cannibalism rape chicken shagging nudity like you never seen before beware of baby's birthday party entertainers poo eating arson trailer trash perversion egg cross dressing you get the picture above all this is a definite must just beware of the birthday party entertainer and divine wondering around the park
<START> paul who plays hercules in this tv film has to be the hottest thing on two legs ever wow br br but this film is a 100 distortion of the hercules story just like troy this film has nothing to do with the original story zero what makes it especially insulting is that they actually contrived a gay character just so people could hate him making him as dastardly and evil as any character in the history of tv or cinema this is insulting since hercules may have had a wife since that was the expectation of those olden days but he also had at least a dozen male lovers so it is ironic that they should create a gay royal adversary character for this film no not ironic evil the creators of this travesty should hang their heads in shame
<START> i remember watching police squad when it first came on abc in 1982 and i thought it was a very funny show thanks to the many sight gags non and scripts filled with word play in one episode there was a line where a man named once was shot twice br br but unfortunately abc canceled the show after only six episodes i felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode one that i remember was in the opening where the episode's title was different from the one shown on the screen br br leslie nielsen's portrayal of frank was deadpan yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of jack webb of dragnet alan north did well and peter lupus in one of his few roles since mission impossible wasn't bad as but the one character that stood out was johnny the boy played by william after giving advice to there were cameos from dick clark dr joyce brothers and then dodger manager tommy lasorda br br even though police squad had a short life on abc the zucker brothers didn't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the naked gun movie franchise i'll close with a regular closing gag freeze the ending right here
<START> i have read the last comment made on this film and have to utterly and totally disagree with it br br you see i am of portuguese nationality and even though this film may say little to someone coming from boston it surely says something to both portuguese and brazilian people as well as immigrants everywhere br br and why you may wonder well firstly this film deals with two sibling nations portugal and brazil brazil gained its independence in the early 19th century by the hands of the heir to the portuguese throne and since then relations improved greatly br br however meaningful as this may be there is still a lot of prejudice because of the economic climate in brazil during the 1990's immigration to portugal grew massively you see portugal is not only a country sharing a similar language culture and beliefs as brazil but is also a gateway to the rest of europe some people were thus forced to make the decision to cross the atlantic and look for a better life and portugal was the first logical place to try to immigrate to br br as it happens still with a lot of immigrants they were paid averages below the minimum wage and were treated like dirt only in this case because the language is similar they were constantly made aware of their status as immigrants br br another curious thing in this film is the idea it conveys of how a man so knowledgeable of the history of his own country still tried to make a quick buck through coveted national resources it is exactly people like this that keep brazil in a constant state of arrested development as the country is well endowed in natural resources and could easily climb the economic ladder should it be given a fair opportunity br br in a sense this goes to show how colonialism still exists pablo representing the exploited people igor the man whose status as a nobleman or at least rich or well off is assured by the foreign colonialist power which is in turn represented by kraft br br if you have seen other films by salles you will recognize this as a recurring topic the struggle against an oppressing power i do not mean to lecture or be patronising as to teach anyone history but i thought this film was symbolically speaking very powerful i am not saying there wasn't room for improvement as there always is but i think the last comment written on it was not only narrow minded but hands down ignorant br br one last thing to be said on this i have to assume you have watched this film with the eyes of an american film watcher no harm intended by this remark but i mean foreign films cannot all be about beautiful scenery art deals with the problems of its time you would not expect otto dix for example to paint all the lovely places in and the black forest why should you expect a film maker to focus exclusively on scenery when he feels there are more relevant issues to attend to br br in a nutshell do not judge films lightly and with only two or three criteria in scope this film is very interesting its photography is quite good and even the idea the black and white colouring conveys goes hand in hand with what it deals with i believe the image is purposefully grainy like reality no br br watch it and reach your own conclusions
<START> ok so i saw this movie at this year's sundance and i was sorely unimpressed it took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense and it took another 30 minutes before the ham fisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a close up of ryan smile or contrived moralizing after the first 45 minutes however the script blossomed into a watch able albeit not completely entertaining or thought provoking the highlights certainly include both gosling and acting gosling being an up and coming star and morse being an extremely well established character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions as a sidenote after the screening i was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when david morse walked right behind me he looks like the nicest guy in the world but he's a solid and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds i removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject
<START> great film from the late 1970's says much about corporate corruption at the expense of the common person so that the powerful can gain gain huge profits and disregard the environment and safety of others br br nearly 30 years later this film is compelling about the power of certain corporate entities that since the films release have gained ten fold in their ability to control it shows the need for regulation of the public against powerful business interests whose primary goal is profit br br jack lemmon is brilliant while jane fonda and micheal douglas are as equally compelling in their roles the frivolous 70s where damned for much this film redeems the decade br br a film that becomes better after each watching
<START> dramatic license some hate it though it is necessary in retelling any life story in the case of lucy the main points of lucille ball's teenage years early career and 20 year marriage to desi arnaz are all included albeit in a truncated and reworked way br br the main emotional points of lucy's life are made clear lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character lucy ricardo a legend her turbulent romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to desi arnaz lucy desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as tv's most memorable sitcom couple br br as lucille ball rachel york does a commendable job do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one judy davis made when playing judy garland but york makes ball strong willed yet likable and is very funny in her own right even though her comedic timing is different than lucy's she is still believable the film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early i love lucy years but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion br br daniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desi's accent especially in the opening scene madeline zima was decent if not overly memorable as the teen aged lucy br br vivian vance and william frawley were not featured much thankfully since rebecca hobbs and russell newman were not very convincing in the roles not that they aren't good actors in their own right they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing most of the actors were from austrailia and new zeland and the repressed accents are detectable at times br br although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact there are many deviations some for seemingly inexplicable reasons jess oppenheimer the head writer of lucy's radio show my favourite husband which began in 1948 is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with i love lucy in 1951 completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator this movie also depicts marc daniels as being the main i love lucy director for its entire run completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by william asher after the first season also though i figure this was due to budgetary constraints the ricardo's are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in new york when in reality they changed apartments in 1953 the kitchen set is slightly larger and off scale from the original as well the connecticut home looks pretty close to the original except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured br br there's also desi talking about buying rko in 1953 during lucy's red scare incident even though rko did not hit the market until 1957 these changes well could have been for dramatic license and the film does work at conveying the main facts but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to oppenheimer and asher two vital figures in i love lucy history the biggest gaff comes in the i love lucy recreation scenes at least a few of them it's always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people but even more so when obvious changes are made the scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away the we're having a baby number was shortened as well but other than that it was practically dead on by far the best was the grape stomping scene with rachel york really nailing lucy's mannerisms the producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the vitametavegamin and candy factory bits instead showing the actors rehearse them these scenes proved effective because of that approach br br the film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about lucy's life since much is skimmed over or omitted at all overall though it gives a decent portrait of lucy desi's marriage and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively
<START> ha ha first of if you've never seen a dimension film your in for a real treat known primarily for super low budget horror slasher films beowulf was no exception br br however this video was more in the style of ultra cheesy i missed the k r a f t label on the side br br consider the anachronisms something out of place and time br br we had candles armour swords br br yet we saw telescopes soled shoes cigarette lighters loudspeakers electricity body bags aluminum foil tins and spoons forks br br not bad for something that takes place in like the 8th century br br this is not a horror film is a horrible film its very laughable its really a comedy made to look like a horror film i couldn't stop laughing br br christopher lambert the highlander series must have really taken a tumble in his career if he's working for dimension films br br i've learned my lesson though i'll be looking at the film studios on the videos a lot more closely now br br rated no reels out of five if you want a good laugh though its hard to pass up on this piece of work br br this move had some cleavage in spots i especially liked the blonde br br wayno br br
<START> i saw dark harbor at the '98 seattle film festival filmed against a autumnal maine backdrop this movie boasts an excellent cast and a plot that keeps you guessing throughout at times eerie at times funny i have to say that it stayed with me for days after seeing it rickman and walker are wonderful as the icy and reedus is someone you'll be hearing more from i'm sure the opening shot of a winding deserted road in a downpour at dusk and the score that accompanied it set the tone so well just terrific nice nice work from a new ish director screenwriter and his talented crew
<START> but it definitely still only deserves 4 10 stars and no more a moronic dumb kid's father is a fighter pilot who gets shot down by some arab country they never name the country in the movie its really ridiculous they just vaguely refer to some arab nation this movie is really ignorant like that but lamar from revenge of the nerds is in here he is friends with the main character doug masters well doug masters who lives on an air force base his father is an air force pilot yet he fails to get into the air force academy conceives of a plot with help from his retarded friends to steal two jets and go rescue his father yea exactly this is one of the greatest films ever made louis gossett jr is fantastic in his role you can tell he basically wanted to smack the hell out of doug masters the whole movie well anyway you can probably guess how the plot ends i can't believe they made 3 sequels to this movie
<START> you can generally ask two questions concerning 80's low budget horror films and this demon wind' in particular 1 is it a good film no 2 is it a fun film you bet demon wind is a gruesomely filthy and nauseating tale filled with cheesy make up effects and nasty violence the story is pretty much non existent and involves a group of young people revealing the horrible secrets of one of the ancestors apparently his grandparents used to live in a devil worshiping neighborhood and evil in the form of demons and fog still dwells around there but i got to hand it to this film from start to finish it breathes morbidity the diabolical undertones the playful gore and the relatively decent acting all together make this film raise high above the mainstream uninspired 80's slashers for sure it shows some creativity and guts literally where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily this creators clearly got inspired by the success of the evil dead' and perhaps even lamberto bava's demons but what the heck it's fun and made with lots of enthusiasm although this film does have a pretty high what the f ' standard at times especially near the end when flashbacks and laser shows are happily being mixed and what the hell is the story on those two wannabe magicians nonetheless demon wind' gets my recommendation if your likes aren't too high concerning crap horror
<START> what looks like a ho hum porky's rip off turns out to be quite a touching film about being young and in love br br the story concerns three friends gary ricky and david who spend their after school hours looking for sex when a new girl arrives in town gary falls head over heels in love with her br br the film goes from being a sleazy sex film to an examination of teenage insecurities it is funny and sad at the same time it never completely gives into that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made you know the guy meets girl guy loses girl guy gets girl back in the final frame formula that formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl maybe that is why i liked the film so much br br the soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a definite tear jerker it also might be one of the most realistic endings i've ever seen in a love story br br
<START> this story had the potential of a good film the difficult choice of love versus money and the angst and regret of making the wrong one however the movie was ruined by the horrible miscasting of robert redford as the villain who offers 1 000 000 to sleep with demi moore like redford has to pay for it redford's boyish good looks and all american charm just don't cut it as an unlikeable threatening boor redford's acting are insufficient to make his character menacing i can see it now 1 000 000 to sleep with robert redford ok says the lady but you will have to give me some time to raise the money jack nicholson would have been perfect as the sleazeball
