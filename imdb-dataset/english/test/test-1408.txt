<START> a wonderful film ahead of its time br br i think so in the it was all about winning greed is good remember that one i have seen this film more that 20 times to me this is a real desert island film i keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that i just love jessica tandy and hume are simply wonderful also beverly d'angelo beau bridges come in at a close second don't get me wrong there are many more great in this film and it is also the way it is written that made it for me and i hope you a film that you will want to see over and over i think tv shows like exposure and now earl owe a lot to this film but remember it is not a tom cruise film
<START> years ago when darling lili played on tv it was always the pan and scan version which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all br br boy what a terrible film it's so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now it's obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing br br mind you the version on the dvd is the director's cut or in this case let's salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someone's death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things aren't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings there's no catalyst in this story br br one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews' and edwards' previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music it's no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment i'll give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julie's mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending bird's eye view of julie running towards hudson's plane is another wink at sound of music br br the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly off in mid sentence i'm like what happened here br br the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where's peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson's squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that's one slow moving train there br br the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 stars but it's effect is diminished considerably because it's repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man's land is ok even if it's bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying br br the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100 unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like she's on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie she's no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute br br how bad is darling lili even after 37 years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release
<START> i saw this mini movie when it first aired and loved it it kinda funny to see how far people will go for money it's also funny to see how much a boyfriend can be whipped whipped enough to kill i think the cast was great especially the character kristin without her smooth talking and deceptive looks the movie would have not been the same br br i never use to watch usa but now it is one of my stations br br
<START> jack lemmon was one of our great actors his performances in days of wine and roses the apartment some like it hot missing to name the first ones that come to mind were all worthy of best actor nomination his only win was for save the tiger and that's a shame he gets melancholy down to a science but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character he actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one note glengarry glen ross br br as for the movie wonderful supporting work by jack gilford as lemmon's partner and thayer david as an arsonist go for naught because the rest of the script is a muddled jumble of cliched vignettes angst neurotic nostalgia and pointless moralizing worth seeing once as a time capsule into 1970's style experimental direction by
<START> well killshot is not awful but it comes close production values are decent and the main actors do a pretty good job except for rosario dawson in a wasted role but the story is just pathetic i don't know if the elmore leonard book had such dumb characters since i haven't read it but i'm guessing that the book was supposed to be at least slightly humorous the movie has no detectable humor after the first twenty minutes you'll be yelling at the screen oh come on nobody's that stupid in a nutshell and without any spoilers everybody acts in a manner convenient to the plot which makes no sense anyway a very frustrating and unrealistic movie which may account for it sitting on the shelf for as long as it did
<START> i know it's a movie but when it comes to portray real life in any matter it should be as faithful as possible i'm sorry but el isn't as accurate as it seems nor is the dominican republic depicted as it really is in fact it shocked me to see that the filming location for santo domingo was actually cuba and incredibly enough movies with cuban themes havana the lost city bitter sugar the godfather part ii were actually filmed in santo domingo so what happened here why did they shoot the movie in cuba instead of the d r the spanish dialogs with the cuban accent are horrible those are not dominicans on the historic level would have never been hanged he might as well been shot decapitated or died from the inhumane torture he'd been receiving then thrown his body in the caribbean sea but would have never ordered death by strangulation his sick mind wouldn't have allowed it br br acting isn't delivered as expected harvey keitel looks like he's just expecting a paycheck i prefer the leading actress in deep blue sea the rest of the cast would have been excellent in some cuban movie and the same goes for the selected shooting location br br i suggest la del chivo the feast of the goat from bestselling author mario vargas llosa directed by his cousin luis llosa it's a bit more realistic with dominican history the character is very well portrayed and the incident is treated very briefly in this movie
<START> black day blue night was actually good modern noir three young nomads on the run from their own lives team up on something of a road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere as most modern noir does one woman finds that her husband is cheating on her and after finding him in a hotel room decides to head off and start anew strangely enough she travels with her husband's mistress who is forgiveable given that the sleazebag never told her he was married and together while driving in the pouring rain they meet a third very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets while they're giddy and free and all suspicious of one another the cops back at town have them marked as suspects in the death of a policeman br br black day blue night starts out with immediate confrontation and throws in a pretty good story with all it's twists meant to mislead your suspicions of one character after another leading to a very unusual ending that is the movie starts with immediate action confrontation and once you think the story is solved you are immediately thrust into yet another turn in the plot revealing just a little more than you expected before the movie is over br br but as some viewers have written the ending is slightly confusing and a bit of a let down the killer is not who you would immediately expect and once revealed becomes somewhat confusing due to a rather thinly explained flashback which reveals all of the necessary motive to solve the mystery but actually there is a finale beyond that which i would think is the most interesting of the film because modern noir always involves a circle of criminal suspects almost always all of them guilty of something it is also a genre that always involves money and thus the question in these movies always becomes how far are the characters willing to go for money br br if you like this rendition of modern film noir i would suggest watching red rock west it's also got j t walsh and some going ons in the blasted desert
<START> thomas mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film a death in venice although in the book the hero is an author in the film the director luchino visconti who also wrote the screenplay transforms him into a composer as such the author composer gustav von dirk bogarde on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned out artisan after a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life he decides to go on vacation to venice where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition however while staying at the picturesque seaside resort he captures the attention of a beautiful young teenage boy who eyes him with curious interest and is immediately smitten by him although gustav is captivated by the wondrous youth he nevertheless must find some private time away from the boy's governess nora ricci while having to cope with a invading plague which seems to have infested the city the movie dialog like the novel remains subtle as are the few brief encounters between the boy and the artist in the end the audience unlike the book is hampered with innuendos and imaginative flights of fancy their affair is never given wing substance or opportunity and were it not for the brief resolution in the book the film allows only the possibility of 'what if ' nevertheless one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment's peace to obtain that which is forbidden elusive but definitely criticized by prying eyes great story and a bogarde classic
<START> please if you're thinking about renting this movie don't if you're thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips don't if i had my way nobody would even have to read this summary br br the acting despite being one fo the high points of the movie was still pathetic the director was probaly a sadist the witty one liners were something you'd expect from a room of highly paid anti social 7 year olds that eat paint chips for breakfast br br the problem with this movie is that it tries to be a movie like evil dead 2 do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies in that it's so bad it's funny but it also tries to be funny at the same time and fails so overwhelmingly to do so that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag reflex in an to save itself br br i could go on for much much more detailing just how awful it really was but i think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it if you need me i'll be off trying to boil myself so that i might feel clean again
<START> the cover of the vhs says it all without doubt the most powerful movie of its kind since the texas chainsaw massacre i'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and i have to say i agree 100 the characters are believable the actors have an excellent charm especially george kennedy as the forest ranger there's the twisted atmosphere that only tcm has an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror this has to be one of the most beautifully shot horror films of all time jeff as a director of this 1981 low budget film does and excellent job and with his other works blue sunshine wrong turn added he must be one of the most underrated directors in the today
<START> after seeing the 'oh so fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average i was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another coen 'masterpiece' this time i was much less disappointed than i was with fargo and i must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of george clooney well done mr clooney make more of these and less 'perfect movies you can act and you showed it here br br 7 out of 10
<START> 1st watched 10 29 2006 4 out of 10 dir john stephenson mildly entertaining story of a group of five kids who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight work in world war i as england entered the war they are told not to go in the greenhouse of the uncle's mansion which of course they do over and over and they discover a sand fairy who them daily wishes that only last until the sun goes down this is the it referred to in the title created by the jim henson group and voiced by eddie izzard the problem is their wishes usually bring about other problems that they are supposed to learn from this part of the movie is not done very well because it's obvious the children primarily the freddie character do not learn from them but instead keep going back to it to solve their next big problem it is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian eddie izzard really not given much opportunity to improvise and kenneth branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle although he is the best character the children are fine as far as their acting abilities but the story probably would have been much better going into the fantasy realm but they did have a human story to tell as well which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers so all in all this was an ok film but could have been much better
<START> as the above suggests i was ultimately unimpressed with this movie it is lovely to look at the scenery is lush but the detail of the story in particular the characters are totally unbelievable films don't have to be believable but films like this with a political edge and social commentary do br br similarly i have no problem with commercialism as such but once again films like this shouldn't be making casting decisions purely based on box office draw this is absolutely the case with sutherland who is frankly rubbish as doyle his accent was far from authentic but he fell into the biggest trap of all his accent is his performance and we end up with a caricature of with no personality outside of his nationality i find it totally implausible that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job all in all this is a clear case of commercial interest over quality and when you're trying to be the mission this kind of thing wrecks your chances of success br br speaking of accents there were a couple more problems one being the striking modernity of boy's accent which acted to dispel the feeling of being transported to another time more surprising was samantha morton's much lauded irish accent which was variable to say the least her voice meandered between strong north and soft south even in the voice overs where i would've expected any such discrepancies to be picked up br br however these are minor gripes compared to the motivation and actions of sarah she never seems at home with the english and almost instantly at home with her son and his tribe the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she if offered just seems like a no brainer perhaps a lot has been lost in editing perhaps this was meant to be a three hour film or a mini series where these things could've been fleshed out but i can only judge what i've seen br br now the biggest problem sarah's morton relationship with doyle sutherland is incomprehensible the fact is that her affection for him is not conveyed in any way until her having to choose between him and her son the conflict she goes through at this point was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me br br as you may have guessed this movie didn't work at all for me but it is top notch to look at you really won't see anything more stunning in terms of scenery there are some good performances and my wife liked it
<START> i remember seeing this film in the theater and liking it i happened to stumble upon it on fear net last month and watched it again and found it better with age first of all for those of you who describe this as 80s cheese if you objectively compare it with the horror flicks of the past 2 decades it compares quite well if stacked up against films in its unique horror sub genre which i would term action horror as opposed to psychological horror such as the shining or the exorcist br br furthermore for its budget this film really delivers the goods or in this instance bad the film actually has some character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door the film also has several hilarious one liners and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horror flick should have if you compare nod to contemporary big budget horror films such as i am legend the vincent price version was much better this film really stands out modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by cgi most have no plot or character at all and are completely predictable the special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are plastic if this is 80s horror cheese i'll take it over 95 of current entries in the genre br br on a closing note seeing nod again made me remember the beautiful jill and wonder why i have not seen her in more films horror or otherwise jill on the odd chance that you read this i think you are gorgeous and should have been in more films lastly if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a lot
<START> an untidy man known as bill lives in a small dreary flat with a poster of marilyn monroe on the wall and his typewriter for company only the man can't think of anything to write he wanders around the streets following people just to see where they go maybe this will give him some inspiration to write he begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag he follows him for a few days while in a cafe the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of bill and inquires why bill is following him the well dressed man says his name is cobb cobb then surprisingly informs bill that he is a burglar and even starts to take bill with him into houses to steal things although cobb insists he doesn't go into other people's homes to just steal he says he likes to let people know he has been there and interrupted the things they take for granted he puts knickers from another burglary into a man's trousers for example br br the film is told in flashbacks at times too the director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature memento bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit on the advice of cobb he meets a blonde lady in a club who used to date the owner a bald man who is very dangerous she says we see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man's hence men on a man's fingers in the blonde lady's flat these are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion
