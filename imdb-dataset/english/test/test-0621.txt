<START> problem child 2 was a complete waste of my time the original film wasn't very good but its a classic compared to this film the first film went over the top with its scenes of a devilish child wrecking major havoc in the lives of everyone he's around here it goes even further over the top and one scene in this movie proves that theory that carnival ride sequence was too much for me to stomach it's awful this movie shouldn't have been made br br 1 2 out of four
<START> a very insightful psychological thriller footprints is a stylish example of the 70's powerful italian film making and luigi a wrongly underrated director and visually amazing the movie develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints especially in its sad and dramatic finale florinda bolkan delivers an excellent performance rich of nuances and touching sensitivity being able to portray a dark lady who is not only fascinating but also painfully real and tragically lonesome but the all cast is a treat as well lila kedrova the mysterious kid by the beach italian screen legend caterina and stunningly beautiful b movie queen evelyn stewart in the brief but haunting role of the protagonist's friend and klaus kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo it's peculiar to notice how incredibly well done movies like footprints were vittorio moody and creepy cinematography stylized locations and sets nicola piovani's haunting score and first of all the story so intense and disturbing so intelligently layered and structured a thriller with fantastic elements but especially with a soul and a personal vision i wish movies like footprints would not be forgotten i wish the movies were more insightful and personal today as they were back in the 60's 70's and yes i wish somebody will soon make a digitally remastered widescreen dvd out of this little masterpiece

<START> in a world where humans can live forever you spend the entire movie wishing they would die first off if you insist on watching this movie do two things first put it on mute don't worry you miss a plot hell they don't even talk for the first 70 min of an 87 min movie after putting on mute you must now hit fast forward till the main chick dies don't worry even if your paying attention you won't know why or how she died once you get to the good part take it of mute oh how will you know the good part wait for an elevator scene with two morons in space suits with wwii weapons these weapons won't seem like much till you realize that the first protagonist had a laser tag pistol and a of co2 cartridges the only remnants of a plot take place between a glowing ball and a semi hot chick who looks like she was attacked by wolverine after listening to the plot you will wish they went back to not talking of the four people that are in this movie none of them can remotely act not even a little bit you will have better luck witnessing acting at a kindergarten theater br br to comment on the special on the special effects let me just say wow no really you will spend the entire movie saying to your self where did this movie's 1 8 million dollar budget go seriously it will leave you in aw of the magnitude of ineptness the best sets are basically windows wallpaper backgrounds the ships are basically flying wrenches wait some are that kinda look like whales i have never heard so many made up words in my whole life they have buttons on their wrist large that can put them in fight mode and super mode makes them super blurry this will seriously drain their power reserves but they find bits of wires to chew on to regain their strength the explosions were less impressive than my fourth of july i only had sparklers br br so the plot as far as i can figure goes something like this mother is a space ship captain and goes to the desert for a while rides a rocket dies then her daughter 6000 years in the future no i am not exaggerating recalls her mother's memories through some sort of capsule anyways they jabber on for another 10 min and then the cause a big bang yes the same big bang that started our solar system it's explained how she goes back in time or something it does not really matter it happened i guess roll credits seriously the whole script was mercifully on one sheet of paper unless that actually detailed any of the dreadfully fight scenes br br after watching the credits i have now laughed more than i did the entire movie the jobs the created like catering supervisor sarcophagus and then the special thanks to george lucas was just the best br br i really wasn't expecting that much for a movie i paid 99 cents for but seriously some body owes me for this most frequent comment heard after the movie i want my life back you have to admire that some but put time and effort in to this movie but seriously why
<START> the movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black and the agency needs a token on the board is ignoring the meeting reading jet magazine at the big table and everybody is ignoring suddenly the ceo on the spot no time is wasted a janitor is called to haul off the corpse and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new ceo and as the votes are one by one the tension is built up and then finally snapped in a hilariously ironic climax to the vote that gives the viewer a delicious dish of logical implications to savor for the rest of the movie if you've ever talked back to some stupid television commercial you'll like seeing this movie too bad there don't seem to be any real in the world
<START> director j s cardone presents something a little scary and a little creepy but nothing more a widowed mother karen lori inherits a home in the pennsylvania mountains so she takes her two daughters and moves into the sprawling estate in what seems the middle of nowhere but it is somewhere somewhere ninety some odd years ago a tragic mining accident claimed the lives of numerous children who were forced to labor in the dark and dank the area and especially the estate seems to be haunted by the spirits of the tiny little wicked souls the legend is the screaming children come out in the moonlight to seek their revenge and you better believe it also in the cast ben cross scout taylor compton chloe julie rogers and geoffrey lewis
<START> bloody birthday opens to a shot of meadowvale general hospital there three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse a caption informs us that it is now california june 1 two teenage lovers duke benson ben marley and annie smith erica hope are getting down to business in an open grave they hear noises and duke investigates both duke and annie are murdered sheriff jim brody bert kramer is baffled and only has the handle of a child's skipping rope that annie was holding as a clue unfortunately before sheriff brody can solve the case his youngest daughter debbie elizabeth hoy and two of her friends curtis taylor billy jayne as billy jacoby and steven andy freeman murder him just as they are finishing sheriff brody off another young boy from their class named timmy russel k c martel turns up the three killers are unaware of how much he saw soon after the incident timmy plays with steven and curtis in a junkyard curtis locks timmy into an old locker timmy manages to escape and tell his sister joyce lori but she doesn't believe him at first the three children carry on their murder spree their strict teacher miss davis susan strasberg a lovemaking couple john avery and sylvia wright in a van and debbie's older sister beverly julie brown are among their victims joyce begins to have her suspicions about debbie curtis and steven which makes her and timmy a target for the evil trio will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers br br co written and directed by ed hunt i have an intense dislike for this film i think it's absolutely awful and doesn't have a single enjoyable aspect to it's 83 minute running time the script by hunt and barry pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children don't have any conscience so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse if that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth before starting their killing spree i guess it just suddenly kicks in right to it's credit it is reasonably well paced but i still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through the film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as i've mentioned next to no motive is given it's very silly at times too check out the scene where debbie stops steven by throwing a bowl of water over him the sheriff's death is put down to him falling down some steps yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident aren't going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality any competent doctor or pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds there isn't a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative there is some out of place looking nudity as debbie charges to let boys peek through a hole while her sister beverly strips there is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing the general incompetence continues throughout the film the whole production is bland and instantly forgettable the acting is poor throughout those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore especially curtis in his geeky over sized glasses i just hate this film really simple as that i can't think of a single good thing to say about it definitely one to avoid
<START> possible spoilers from dreamworks and director peter chan the love is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque new england coastal village where single mom helen kate capshaw owns a quaint little bookstore one day at work helen happens across an anonymous letter the love of the title that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch upon reading the amorous prose therein she believes it has been written to her purposely placed in the couch for her to find and for reasons of her own thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer inadvertently however helen leaves the letter out where her employee janet ellen degeneres finds it believes it to be for her and of course thinks she knows who wrote it circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named johnny tom everett scott who thinks helen has written the letter to him and before it all gets sorted out you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast and i do mean imagine because the way this movie plays out the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself there are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably it simply isn't very romantic and it's not funny and that is a potent combination that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits once the setting and main character helen have been established it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so by the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter and to whom you could care less rounding out the cast is tom selleck blythe danner julianne nicholson gloria stuart and geraldine mcewan it's a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this and looking bad in the balance kate capshaw who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up looks tired here while selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender that's lasted a week ellen degeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch it is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination in the case of the love letter ' however it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place i rate this one 1 10
<START> okay let me start off by saying that on the whole i don't like anime very much i've enjoyed a couple of the oft cited classic series but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that i do american television namely that a good 90 95 of it is utter tripe with the remainder falling anywhere from watchable to decent this being the case it's no wonder that i don't like the self deprecating anime parodies out there i don't get most of the jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all loud hyperactive lowbrow and completely over the top br br so when i started watching this series at the behest of a friend i was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes i figured that the characters were supposed to represent clichÃ© characters from shopworn story outlines and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical i could kind of see where it was coming from but didn't think that it was all that clever lots of wacky fun filled high school shenanigans and goings on only now we're being ironic about it at about the third episode my opinion drastically changed br br it was at that point that the strengths of this series started to manifest themselves the quirks of the non chronological episode order its snarky sense of self awareness and above all clever humor with gasp a well executed straight man br br in what i consider to be a rarity in any medium this show presents well thought out witty interactions between diametrically opposed characters protagonist perpetual sense of vaguely annoyed resignation provides the perfect foil to the actions of title character generic anime like exploits it's a break from formula and it works incredibly well br br based on that strong foundation the series further succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail as previously stated the episodes air out of chronological order i considered this to be a gimmick at first but it works surprisingly well the chronological sequence of events makes sense logically but the aired order of the episodes more closely follows the traditional structure of aristotelian drama the order chosen leaves no narrative gaps that cannot be filled by simple inference but while it is possible to guess what happened in an unaired preceding episode one still feels compelled to watch exactly how those events unfold and superb planning prevents any plot holes or contradictions i watched this series a second time immediately upon completing it the first time and i was amazed at how well even seemingly inconsequential events were all tied together br br the last point is indicative of the extreme attention to detail in every area of the series while the stock anime character designs grate a bit the background art is exquisite realistically rendered based upon actual photographic references animation quality is also excellent at important points for example there is a musical performance late on in the series in which the characters are shown actually playing a song this may sound trivial but the subconscious effect of watching film quality animation which actually corresponds to the soundtrack is incredible br br in short i love this series for some reason by its very nature it is something that i generally dislike but its execution is so unique and well carried out that i can't help it
<START> or vice versa br br this is a french film noir directed by an american film maker jules dassin who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by hollywood thanks to huac the premise of the story is rather familiar one last jewel heist for tony le and his buds and so is the ending with everybody getting well no spoilers here for sure since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important br br dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous the engaging sometimes intruding score by georges nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from american film noirs from the forties and early fifties jean plays the hardcore consumptive lead in a fedora much as humphrey bogart might have played him tony's recently out of prison past his prime but still tough and decisive when he has to be his mind still sharp when focused the kind of anti hero whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall br br dassin plays the italian and would be ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless br br in film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys often there are levels of bad guys the good bad guys we are identifying with and the bad bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys and then maybe there's a really bad bad bad guy or two here we have remi played by robert hossein a slightly sadistic druggie then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so in more modern film noir the bad guys are not even good bad guys and they get away with it or something close to that in the old film noir which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties the usual motto following the old hollywood code was crime doesn't pay with every criminal having to pay for his or her crime before the end of the movie br br probably the most impressive feature of rififi is how nicely the film moves along the plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly much the way the great film directors always did it directors like stanley kubrick louis malle and the best of hitchcock some have actually compared this to kubrick's the killing 1956 and suggest that kubrick stole a little well directors always steal if need be and there are some perhaps telling similarities such as it being one last heist for the protagonist and having the girl gum up the works the similarities may go deeper because as this film was nearing its end i suddenly thought oh no the suitcase in the back seat is going to fly out of the convertible hit the ground burst open and all the money is going to fly into the air those of you who have seen the killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money oliver stone's u turn 1997 starring sean penn there the money in his backpack gets blown to smithereens by a shotgun blast ha ha ha getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue when there is some the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue about 30 minutes worth is terse and easy to follow requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles which by the way are quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out br br one other thing all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film that is off camera a guy gets his throat slit we don't see it i kind of like this approach we don't have to see the gore you could almost let your kids see rififi almost br br catch this one now and be on the lookout for a hollywood reprise starring al pacino and directed by harold becker coming out next year in which you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played out in full
<START> you know i've seen a lot of crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good but running out of time was great br br i guess what made it so good was the fact that andy lau and ching wang have such great chemistry the film at first is really fast paced but slows down not enough to even notice which is also good we don't want to have a heart attack lol in terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested lau has some pretty good moments as he uses make up to impersonate people from the underworld also the movie has the best oriental supporting cast since house of flying daggers br br the movie is great because its so unpredictable and leaves you wondering at every corner definitely a good rental with tons of comedy action and thrills pact in to one 8 out of 10
<START> this is a very underrated movie to say the least as has been pointed out in previous posts this movie has a somewhat loose and highly implausible script but you find yourself saying who cares while shooting milk or insert beverage of your choice here through your nose it was indeed due to a rare mix of actors in sync while kelsey grammar is obviously a gifted actor reference this movie the supporting actors actress play their roles quite well i found in interesting how they threw in the part about duane martin blowing the shot in the 'big game' for navy's basketball team if any of you is a basketball fan you'll remember martin from 'white men can't and 'above the and you'll know that martin had a short stint in the nba with the nice how they threw in believable character attributes such as this rob schneider's anal retentive character was the perfect offset to grammar's calm demeanor lauren holly played the gutsy sexpot with a brain well enough to make you want her to succeed this is a movie that will make you laugh even if you've seen it many times before the comic bits in this movie definitely last i still find myself laughing 12 years later br br is that one of my chickens uhhh no this a parrot from the caribbean well don't let it fly away that's supper
<START> luis bunuel's will always be remembered as a great film because it is absolutely honest in its presentation of comical assault on religion it is one of those outstanding films which must be shown to all people especially young children in order to them with the notions of good and bad sacred and evil the toughest question asked by is about the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion it has been tackled by involving numerous ordinary people who are not at all above petty affairs in their mundane lives especially sins bunuel scores tremendously by showing us that various questions related to class differences deserve frank honest and reliable answers appears credible as it has been made in a light comical vein this is the sole reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely true to life to all audiences it is amazing how bunuel approaches quest for true love issue in his film this black white gem was shot marvelously by gabriel figueroa one of luis bunuel's favorite cameraman film critic rao saw at india during 13th international film festival of kerala 2009 was introduced by eminent indian cinema personality mr p k nair as part of a special package called 50 years ago this is a film which should be with any discerning dvd collector
<START> let me say this new he man cartoon is not destroying childhood memories as i didn't like the old he man cartoon either i loved the action figures but i found the cartoon to be corny and i hated the storyline the he man i liked was the one from the very early pre cartoon mini comics included in the figure boxes where he man was a barbarian the sword of power was split in two pieces and there was no prince adam no ripoff premise and no anyway let's leave the old stuff alone br br the new he man cartoon or at least this pilot is a disgrace on its own s it represents both the worst cheesiness of the old show and the worst of nowadays i watched it because i had heard the in your face morals of the old show were thankfully gone and this one had more swordplay and character development but i encountered an awful mishmash of the worst clichÃ©s of the genre characters i couldn't help but hate and the sadly inevitable matrix esque visual style br br i think it was a good idea to give a bit of a background to the characters as it was showing a pre face peeling skeletor but that's how far the character development goes aside from the usual coming to age rubbish i see coming in the subsequent episodes where this teenybopper adam will be learning the responsibility of his new acquired powers blah blah at least in the old show adam was not a spoiled brat i found myself hating his guts that's what we get when they put out an adventure show aimed at pre teens pretty faces and wanna be cool and look juvenile clothes i should check new episodes to see if n'sync make a special appearance man does this show remind me to the 1996 flash gordon stinkbomb cartoon br br dialogue ha it follows absolutely every clichÃ© in the book from the goody lil two shoes in the opening scene to immortal oh and he man i lied in the ending and voice is still the same high pitch kind than in the old series 20 years and nothing we have learnt br br and sure nowadays there can't exist something remotely action related that's not matrix style leave anime to the japanese folks think fresh ideas and seeing the characters' poses while fighting didn't help either br br of course we have our usual dose of evil lyn now i think about it who the hell comes up with these names has no yellow skin now but grey ish oh so no asian people will be offended i bet won't appear in the show either shades of the 1996 again where ming the merciless was a green toad like alien br br people are complaining about lack of speech i don't think i would have liked this more or less if cringer spoke he's corny enough this way and you have your extra ration of cheese with the shocking thing is probably many of the people who rightfully hated jar jar binks might be huge fans br br i watched the feature lenght pilot and i've had enough leave the series alone 2 out of 10
<START> i would not deny that i have quite enjoyed watching any japanese horror films but everyone must get quite fed up with them after you have seen the same thing over and over br br the film follows the story of the grudge audrey as requested by her mom is going to get her sister back but when she arrives something strange happens to her sister and then her sister is killed she wants to find out the truth behind the curse and later a photographer eason joins her on the other hand there's also something happening to a family and three girls but they seem to realise it too late br br in fact i can't see the points for the three girls from international school to appear in the movies as they're not quite related to the story the reason why the woman holding the grudge keeps killing people is still not very clear it seems to me they're just telling the same things i saw in the grudge and the sudden appearance of audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly odd which i suppose is an attempt to make the story about the family related the killing scenes are absolutely the mixture of those in the ring and kaidan the acting would be another bad point as a hong i would really like to support edison chen's first effort in hollywood but as a film lover i really can't find any point to support bad acting other actors like the father though he just appears in a few scenes should also have done better what is kept good is the atmosphere of the film especially when i watched it in the middle of the night alone br br if you have time really enjoy any horror films and have seen all the possible horror films except this like me you can go for it to kill some time but if you really like japanese horror films of this kind you should spend some time watching the japanese version of the ring
