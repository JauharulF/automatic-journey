<START> an epic story of hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition seeing as terrence malick produced this i expected something haunting and lyrical instead we get a typical norwegian co production revolution with al pacino anyone where quite possibly good intentions are scuppered by a dreadful screenplay and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes the me tarzan you jane english dialogue between the non english speaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy Â one could speculate whether nick nolte and tim roth ad libbed their own as they almost sound like real people the story is loaded with implausibility we are expected to believe that can speak a smattering of english after having spent his entire life living as a peasant slave his vocabulary but unfortunately not grammatical command increases impressively in the refugee camp without the benefit of night classes coincidence is rife i wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third he tracks down his mother in ho chi city almost immediately after bumping into his thirty year younger half brother who nonchalantly recognises him mum gives him a gold or something similar of great value as they part but this is never referred to again his relationship with me dead inside ling is supposed to provide the obligatory love interest but feels as artificial as leonardo and cameron in gangs of new york br br the voyage in the rust bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails indeed the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable is the jerky hand held footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions incidentally a boat cruise from malaysia to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast without stopping for fuel or supplies is certainly an epic journey the beautiful shot of the new york skyline echoes malick's use of magic hour but i want to know why the coast guard didn't show up perhaps they were watching the super bowl or something of course manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in texas with the same flair he displayed in ho chi city i was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick for demonstration of how a story about the travails refugees could be structured and shot on a small budget check out michael far superior in this world
<START> the first movie of this series was well written and original this show drags on poorly written gags boring flashbacks not the comedy that i expected even the young folks found it boring there are certainly bright moments historical elements and some good acting but overall i can only recommend this for dvd tape at home
<START> is this a bad movie don't take my word for it consider the following press reports of people who tried to watch this movie br br Â· while he was watching this movie the brain of mr harold of ohio forcibly ejected itself from his skull at over 200 and preceded to squirm across the floor shrieking noooo nooo noooo br br Â· mrs louise robbins of enid oklahoma a 69 year old retired homemaker committed ritual with a butter knife while watching this movie br br Â· ms janine of columbia south carolina gave birth to a severely deformed baby while watching this movie although she had not been pregnant br br Â· while watching this movie together mr and mrs lawrence wells of san franciso california spontaneously exploded with such force that mr wells's left was later found embedded in the wall of a house in marin county br br there have been many similar incidents br br of those who did not suffers more serious effects such as those detailed above at least 75 became incurably violently and understandably insane after viewing this movie of the remaining 25 most had already been insane before viewing the movie the remainder were either blind and or and deaf or in a persistent vegetative state br br i'm not saying don't rent it if you want to i'm just reporting what was in the papers
<START> in the 2nd of his historical martial arts films chiba portrays his real life sensei mas oyama the film even recreates incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands oyama did this feat over 50 times in real life dynamic fight choreography featuring authentic techniques ironically this is one of the rare sonny chiba films in which he doesn't tear out or rip off body parts of opponents a must see for sonny chiba fans definitely one of his top 5 films
<START> christopher nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out shot on a micro budget of 6 000 this is a student film with real class the film is shot in black and white and features people who you assume are friends of nolan's appearing in the movie this is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good you could see jeremy and alex haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago br br nolan's thriller much like memento does not play chronologically it shifts the scenes around much like pulp fiction the writing is fantastic it is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting i thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent br br for a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all this is so good it is superior to most that hollywood studios offer and nolan after three films this the superior memento and the not quite as good but still excellent insomnia has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times i can't wait for batman br br this film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch it is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising i also thought that the score from david was also excellent very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it he has gone on to compose nolan's other films br br overall i would recommend this i intend to get all of nolan's films this is a low budget gem br br
<START> this movie is over hyped i am sad to say that i manage to watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that i will have to force myself real hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie it's totally stupid and very fake the robot in the movie looks like a man wearing those steel suit and the acting is really bad especially the one playing the character alien he is totally annoying don't waste your money watching this sequel to the popular gen x cops i'd rather sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie 1 out of 10 if possible i'd give 0
<START> like most people i was interested in more solely because of the pink floyd soundtrack which has turned out to be the only pink floyd album that i still listen to after all these years it was quite a surprise to run across the film in a local video store in a digitally remastered version it was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie br br visually it is quite beautiful especially when the two main characters are cavorting on the rocks on the spanish island of ibiza and the use of the soundtrack music which as far as i can tell is exclusively by pink floyd is excellent it was a joy to watch the film with my copy of the album alongside me mentally ticking off each track as it was used in the film dave brief a spanish piece was the only one i didn't hear and several tracks are used quite prominently especially main theme and quicksilver that latter track is tedious on the soundtrack album but works very well during the title sequence of the film resurfacing at least once later on maybe now i can appreciate it on the album now that i have some visuals to accompany it in my mind br br the plot of more is a little hard to take at times especially in the early going when the film appears to be merely a vehicle to demonstrate the hipness of those involved in making it but eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer as the plot becomes more focused why does stefan take heroin why does anybody take heroin fully knowing the possible consequences the film does not attempt to answer that question directly but stefan's heroin use seems a logical extension of his single minded pursuit of pure pleasure br br i strongly recommend this film to any pink floyd fan who has an appreciation of the vastly underrated more soundtrack i also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in sixties counterculture and how it was portrayed in the media i have no idea how realistic this movie is since i am too young to have experienced the sixties firsthand but it does seem to capture the spirit of the times in a way that no other movie does
<START> i can't believe that i actually sat thru this entire film a friend rented it because the jacket made it sound good in it's defense the jacket was correct there was a supposed haunted room that someone slept in overnight from the jacket it sounded like this was on par with freddy jason or maybe the shining it couldn't be farther from the truth br br if you are a fan of minimalist and or surrealist films you may enjoy it if you're looking for a good fright movie or a couple of thrills go rent jason vs freddy iv you'll have a much better night
<START> might contain spoilers br br ok lets conclude this movie in one word bad two words really bad now why do i think that let me explain br br guttenberg leads a special ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms dealer stole it from a lab they do this by attacking the arm dealers in mid flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting however suspicions arise about guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name after debriefing the team members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved after deciding they cant trust their bosses they decide to once again steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackers br br in theory this is a plot that could have worked in a low budget movie that just aims to be aired on tv however the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts firstly the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes second the acting is really bad or the actors are directed to act as there aren't many emotions change of facial expressions at all etc i was especially disappointed in guttenberg that i believe can do so much more but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough action hero in addition though i am not by any means any expert on the subject i totally believe i could assemble a better covert ops team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week this seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible this go for good guys bad guys and bystanders as well then i sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants if any of the film for example i have poured liquid over my hand and i didn't break instantly br br don't know how to conclude this really but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do sorry can't be any nicer than that do not watch this movie it is not even so bad it is funny 2 10
<START> this is a 100 improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time this is a john hughes movie meets the devil's rejects i really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series i thought jennifer tilly played tiffany really well and brad dourif in chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine actually they're the only good parts of the movie i got rather bored with katherine heigl and nick scenes it's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day but chucky and tiffany were great to watch and i really liked the black humor to it i thought it made the movie stand out more if you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out br br 7 10
<START> frank clint eastwood is a secret service agent plagued with guilt over the assassination of president john f kennedy while he was on duty thirty years later and the current president is entering a re election campaign but he is receiving death threats and has been called in to assist in what should be a routine research operation john malkovich plays the professional assassin and master of disguise who is tracking the president and using the past he begins to torture in a psychological duel of cat and mouse br br malkovich eastwood and rene russo all give wonderful performances in this top notch thriller the direction is excellent and the entire picture is charged with tension and intrigue throughout br br a must see for thriller fans 8 10
<START> here's a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game turkey shoot gymkata and the running man br br certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work generally bland action sequences a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout br br take for example towards the end of the film when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep upon discovery of the said corpse the villains response bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all Â they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit br br however i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode even if his screen time is very limited br br not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b movie enthusiasts
<START> think like a dinosaur was an well produced executed show of the series the actor enrico as michael burr plays an impressively well and convincing protagonist role you can actually identify yourself with him and his feelings on what to do to the girl whom he has fallen for because he's been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until kamala comes to his life with a timid fear of performing the task of being transported he then consoles her and let's her know it's all going to be alright which ends up being an deception to both of them more so something bad occurs and she prototype comes back and her clone is sent to the other inhabitant planet although the dino and micheal have yet to find this out when they do it's up to michael to decide to either kill her or to let her live yet what happen to him prior upon meeting her kamala was very much related to what happen to his wife his wife died similarly this show professes and sorrow thru out most of it after the show you're left pondering about what should have been done and you're stuck with the 50 50 of what's right from wrong hence the balance equation being solely there is no one br br 10 10 highly recommend watching this show
<START> out of the handful of alternative titles in english the is definitely the most appropriate one since this is basically just a shameless rip off of william friedkin's classic horror film in which they replaced 13 year old linda blair with the 19 year old stella only so that she could gratuitously show her ravishing naked body i'm not sure what exactly satan tries to accomplish here but he exclusively seems to possess the young girl to play sexual tricks on her poor masturbates around the clock and tries to seduce priests and even her own father into having sex with her the young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious theology student with an odd looking boyfriend driving a stupid yellow car and loving albeit adulterous parents when she takes a peculiar crucifix home to renovate the ancient relic comes to life and no less than satan himself played by ivan rassimov of jungle holocaust and planet of the vampires starts to torment her the overlong masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three quarters of the movie and then finally director mario begins with the actual exorcism that final segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish the priests don't really do anything apart from saying some vague prayers but somehow seems cured all of a sudden there isn't much gore the dialogues are horrible and the producers seem to compensate every little flaw by adding more sleaze this is one of the strangest italian exploitation efforts of the seventies why the hell are they referring to the rocky horror picture show but definitely not one of the best if you fancy clones of the exorcist i recommend demon witch child beyond the door and the antichrist
<START> while many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic i really connected with it there is no plot as such rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them br br personally i thought the acting was mostly very good despite the roles being quite demanding at times and i felt a sense of warmth for the characters the situation they were in was quite terrifying and i really felt nervous for them i found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival br br the crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film and believe me i have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies the creature moved well and had real menace and although the audience i was with didn't seem too keen on the film as a whole they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared br br script wise i would have made a few changes particularly towards the end but this was not a major problem for fans of slow burning survival horror set within the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately i think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed
