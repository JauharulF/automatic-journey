<START> great 1980s comic strip comedy set in the south west of england it is a tale of sex drugs cream and murder by the seaside adrian french and saunders nigel hilarious in drag and robbie coltrane play a part dennis tries to impress girlfriend by boasting he is involved in a multi million pounds drug deal this leads to complications with hilarious results i am trying to find out the original picture ratio for this film but it does not appear under 'technical of the imdb site i spotted the dvd in the shop and it appears to be in 1 33 1 full screen format was the film shot in this ratio or was it originally a widescreen film with a pan and scan dvd it would be useful to know as i hate pan and scan films so come on imdb could you find out for us
<START> this is possibly the most perfect film i have ever seen in acting adaptation and direction it is self contained and of a kind so there is no point in saying that it is better or worse than other great films just that it can stand by itself as a perfect work of art br br and it was fun watching confused horror fans getting up and walking out
<START> i just adore this film i love all characters and i can watch it again br br and again and i use to listen to the soundtrack again and again br br although i have seen it about two years after it was made and i br br have never been such youngster as jip and company i can br br understand them and i love their stories and if somebody thinks this film is crap i disagree and i say it is br br full of positive energy and friendship and love and full of youth br br the weekend has landed enjoy it
<START> this might sound weird but i only got to see the first movie the emperor's new groove a week ago and only because of one episode of the tv show i simply adore character but isn't that bad either anyway eventually i decided to watch the second film just so i would've seen it hoped it would be as good as the first one but i'm sorry to tell this but the more the humour got american the more i yawned i agreed with when he started crying seeing all the cheesy footage br br still younger kids and probably veterans too will love this movie to bits if they like the old school moralising disney that is but i just had expectations that were an eensy teensy little bit hell of a lot higher than they should've been is a lovely character being good hearted and dumb all at once but it were and in drag that woke me up at the end of the movie i'll ignore rudy for as far that's possible br br anyway great movie just not my style and as they say you always have to be true to your groove
<START> in 60s hong kong a man and woman move in the same day into adjacent apartments with their respective spouses soon they suspect their ever absent spouses of having an affair with one another a strange bond emerges between the man and woman as they cope with their sadness by taking turns playing each other's spouse before a more complex bond emerges br br no summary can do it justice for hong kong auteur wong kar wai's in the mood for love is nothing short of a miracle a story about sadness that manages to be touching and at times funny a romance that never feels forced or fake no doubt the director's method has a lot to do with that br br directed from an inexistent screenplay though the concept largely flows from a japanese short story to favor improvisation the film is immediately set apart by the freshness of it's performances all the film revolves around that and the rest is pure enhancement at the core of the film are two characters that will ease into your heart and stay there long after the end credits roll maggie cheung and tony leung are simply amazing and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth they display the additional material is also top notch the films is magnificent to behold in part lensed by hero 's christopher doyle and the music is heartbreaking br br this is something everybody must see if only because it is by far the most heartfelt mature and authentic love story out there unmissable
<START> i went to see this on the strength of albert finney alone he's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver i'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly it's about a little boy who is about to be born but as his mother goes into labor he refuses to come out this sends god and the whole human being factory into a crisis and albert finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born so finney takes the unborn boy for an adventure in the big apple in hopes of showing him all the reasons he should want to live br br despite the ridiculousness of the plot i could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn this into your typical hollywood sentimental moralistic message film the film was rendered unbearable by a horrible soundtrack of the stock sentimental music that hollywood directors seem incapable of resisting br br he further butchered the somewhat unconventional story by giving away its hand at every moment whatever twists and turns were in store in the plot were completely given away by the way the story unraveled it was as if the director assumed the audience is just a bunch of idiots who cannot see the obvious hints coming from a mile away br br even finney in his performance though satisfactory seemed a bit awkward and out of place and the little boy with curly locks though he was supposed to be cute was in fact rather dull bridget fonda seemed intent on trying to duplicate demi moore's performance in 'ghost' shedding tears at a moment's notice br br i understand that the film has been unsuccessful thus far at getting distribution in the u s which surprises me as i think it has the box office potential to be a modest hit appealing to both kids and sentimental adults as far as the quality goes it's not an awful film it's just not very good 4 out of 10
<START> greedy land baron in the tiny western town of prairie city wants all the ranchers off their land using intimidation tactics and arson to get them to vacate seems the town is swimming atop oil and when a swedish farmer refuses to leave he's mowed down by the baron's hired gun the farmer's seafaring son soon arrives slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight another lawlessness in the west story with everybody under the thumb of the villain who naturally holds all the cards derivative and uncomfortable at times to watch with a long wait before our stoic hero finally gets his up sterling half hearted swedish accent is a big problem though he cuts a sturdy sympathetic presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth watching director joseph h lewis stages most of the scenes stiffly like a tv western and gerald fried's bugle heavy score is no help though the rich black and white cinematography by ray is excellent an independent production released via united artists the film has a bizarre start beginning with shots from the finale followed by shots from the movie's midsection yet it does have a certain power which most assuredly gets the viewer on side from
<START> no it's not citizen kane but would you expect it to be with a name like meatballs it's the best damn summer camp movie of all the summer camp movies does anyone quote little darlings line by line or whitewater summer br br this is just one of those movies that got into my brain when i was in junior high and stayed with me all these years every time i feel geeky i mumble spaz spaz spaz spaz or when we're hiking in the brush in the forest i tell my husband i'm da wabbit he doesn't get it it just doesn't matter it just doesn't matter i mean this stuff is classic br br disappointed with the dvd though wish there were special features maybe a commentary or a making of but the movie itself is a perfect snapshot of life as an adolescent in the late '70s maybe not my life you can't help but want to run around out in the woods in shorty shorts and knee high socks and feathered hair every time you see this movie
<START> rickman is sexy and good but the stranger is less convincing reedus is sort of sexy but he is not a consistent actor this could be the director's fault in this case we are supposed to find him alluring in the extreme just because he is pretty but that's not enough the thwarted wife is almost convincing 7 years marriage and she and character should be more settled with each other whether their roles are to be incompatible or not they must have patterns by now i get that although i think the wife is a bit stiff in her role and not convincingly attracted to the stranger so that's a failing the unspoken bonding between the rickman character and the stranger is better done even if we are not sure what it is i miss sexy english accent luckily he slips into it and out of the american pattern disappointing but with some great acting
<START> with the exception of the fine rack on clara evans this show was pretty bad so why did i watch it too much coffee and had to relax before hitting the sack watching bb change into his lamest big chief outfit was amusing at best downright laughable at worst br br i could have made a better and special effects on my dell br br boxlietner has seen better days this guy is a year younger than me and he's looking more and more like the scarecrow from his tv series days back in the early 1980 the women eye candy need to go back to acting school although evans size 40 and playing a 17 year old she's in her early 20s was a stretch the sci fi channel has done better that this but for us folks that don't get out to the bars much anymore i guess we have to take what we can get after all anything that gets you away form cnn and fox coverage of election 2008 these day is a good thing
<START> dungeon of harrow had a lot of things that could've made this quite a good horror film creepy mansion a torture chamber a paranoid host a henchman a ghoul in the dungeon etc but sadly to say this wasn't made very well br br a writer and a skipper get shipwrecked on an island owned by a count in a castle his slave and a mute maid the count becomes more and more suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates of all things and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them and the mute maid who befriends them to torture and imprisonment sound not bad right br br well not quite i used to call this one of the worst movies i have ever seen but now i hesitate because it had so much potential it can't really be called one of the worst however seeing all this potential go to waste is a really big hit against this film all in all it's not a very good movie br br there is a very gothic suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted by the insane and leprous rotting bride adorned in a tattered wedding dress this was both creepy and disturbing the first time i saw the horror unfold in this scene man i wish this was a better movie br br this movie had all the right stuff to make this a moody late night chiller but ultimately took all the wrong turns i suggest someone remake this one
<START> this movie is very well done although the ending is given away too early in the film the four elderly men in the restaurant are what makes this film fun to watch minnie driver is a very talented actress and comes across wonderfully on screen
<START> i put this second version of the man who knew too much to my top 10 hitchcock movies together with frenzy it's probably the most argued film among the fans of hitchcock i consider it far better than say rebecca which has gained unreasonably much appreciation br br the film contains many ingenious scenes most of them have been mentioned in other reviews but that's something to be expected from hitchcock it takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen but that time is used for preparing the following happenings which are full of intriguing suspense br br if you can ignore the clumsy rear projections the only weakness of this film is the main villain played by bernard miles who is a rather flat and undeveloped character luckily there is a creepy assassin in the form of reggie and hank the little boy isn't as irritating as most kids in old movies
<START> first of all let me start by saying that i have been a devoted follower of c thomas career ever since the outsiders and the hitcher he was an up and coming star in the 1980s with hits such as soul man also the future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really assert himself in hollywood put it this way tom cruise had a bit part in the outsiders while howell had the lead look at cruise today but picking material like this drivel will only denigrate career even more if that was possible why does he pick stuff like this a small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbish br br essentially the story here takes place in a post apocalyptic world where everybody lives underground where chaos reigns howell is a shepherd protecting the flock of various religious leaders by killing off any undesirables he's a hit man in other words br br the sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode the use of slow motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too br br i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie br br in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell come on c give yourself some credit and wrestle yourself away from these non hit wonders and try to knuckle down and get a good part however small br br 1 10 and only because there is no setting for 0 10
<START> this twisted comedy is well acted and directed very funny and the production quality is outstanding it is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards br br everyone can identify with calvin having a bad day bad week bad life travis davis plays the role superbly richard moll as tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right the old man adds to the humor of the story and who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish br br this short will bring lots of laughs and don't miss the credits as they are playing at the end
