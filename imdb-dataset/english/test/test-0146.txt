<START> i went to see passion of mind because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances i e sliding doors me myself i etc br br but this was the worst one i've ever seen i had to force myself to sit through it i didn't even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me br br the magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was two timing were guys who usually play villains though each was kind of sexy and appealing br br there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex maybe the magic shouldn't be explained for this genre to work br br originally written 5 28 2000
<START> when moviegoers hear two popular villains characters will be fighting they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end there's freddy vs jason in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other and more similarly to this there's godzilla vs insert name here but the very generic komodo vs python is just a horrible title and an even worse premise obviously the movie's a d list picture but at least come up with a more compelling name maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it with a name like this you know what you're getting in to br br a group of military men women including a 20 something year old sexy scientist woman are left for dead by the military on an island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon as long as they can make it off the island and to the boat they'll be fine but no there's a giant python guarding the ocean and the way off let's hope all these guys can make it off the island and that the python and komodo don't verse each other in some sort of horrible special effect battle br br really this movie is bad in almost every way the acting is pretty bad or maybe it's that the special effects are so cheesy that the acting is unbelievable because no one believes that these people are in any danger with creatures that look like they were made on an early 90s computer nonetheless this movie is actually pretty funny the creatures are so clunky looking and the actors really give it their all pretending like they're in danger br br i'd like to say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh squawk but i can't this pg 13 rated film actually bleeps itself out every time a curse word comes a parrot noise beeps out the word even words that can be said on network television how squawk ing cheap that they bleep out words and with a parrot no less eventually these parrot noises got to me and i couldn't help but laugh at the incompetence br br this movie is bad from the silly beginning to the ridiculous night of the living dead style ending but it's also kind of funny as a horror movie it fails miserably as an action movie it fails slightly less but still pretty bad and as a comedy it shines br br my rating out of 95 mins pg 13 for some violence and out cursing
<START> what a terrible sequel the reason i give this film two stars instead of zero because it's a movie that has violence and gore and critters yet it is planned out poorly and this god awful sequel was done by none other than bum bum bum bum mick garris the bonehead that brought you the remake of the shining which nearly got kubrick to nearly roll in his grave when he discovered it was actually made garris is also the man that brought you the sad sequel of the fly the fly which was a wonderful movie but garris's movie nearly ruined john getz career anyway if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in order don't that's the mistake i made rent the first one or the third one or better yet don't stoop to that level at all this movie sucked so bad that i can't believe it please avoid this crap shame on you mick
<START> i'm very disappointed first of all the german synchronization is bad maybe in the original version with subtitles it would have been better but the whole movie looks like if the director saw luna papa and black cat white cat and tried to produce something in this style too but failed in every aspect it's an incongruent mixture of a weird unbelievable story and very childish gags no atmosphere no life extremely primitive sex humor i voted 2 because 1 is the worst and the other point for she's really cute sorry i like movies but this one is really superfluous
<START> the seasoned actors in this do know how to act and have proved that before but the director who also wrote and produced this travesty is incompetent on so many levels o k it's low budget but i know films students with lower budgets and lesser known actors who can do much much better for example since there were people involved who should know better some of the gun rigs were totally out of place and never existed in those days the stunt work was clumsy the story stale and hokey if some one gives you a copy of this use it for a coaster by the way i love westerns and have known many stunt men and even went to high school with one of the actors so i was looking for it to be good
<START> david dhawan copied hitch and such an unofficial copy the film isn't even 1 2 as funny or amusing as the original it's boring with forced stories like the lara track of having a child and no hubby plus there is an unwanted stupid don and david tries to choke drama too but the film looks disjointed boring br br songs just pop in so does romance and everything barring some funny govinda scenes the dance before interval nothing else is worth mentioning the last few scenes are quite funny but there tend to get too long br br david's direction is as bad as maine pyaar kyun he needs to change his style or attempt something good music is saving grace some songs are good but the situations seem forced br br govinda looks overweight and seems too loud and screams his lines in initial reels but he gets into the groove and gives his best in the office and the scene with salman in his cabin and towards the end br br salman just plays himself and his nasal tone plus his fake style of acting is a headache br br lara is avoidable katrina is fake as usual br br the kid overacts
<START> this movie was terrible it was so very terrible br br most annoying was the way the trial was conducted the defense attorney is allowed to ramble on and on when questioning a witness without the prosecution making any objections he attacks the children brought to give testimony with cruel and repeatedly yells at them that they're lying these just aren't things that they subject children who have been sexually abused to the trial is silly and it ruins the whole movie law order has spoiled me for courtroom accuracy ness
<START> the great james cagney top billed in big letters doesn't show up till the movie's second third and probably has less screen time than dudley digges who plays the vill reform school potentate but when jimmy arrives as a deputy commissioner of something or other out to reform reform schools he slashes the air with his hands and jumps on the balls of his feet and spits out punchy warners first national dialogue with all the customary and expected panache the psychology in this crisp antique one of warners' many efforts to assert its place as the socially conscious studio doesn't run deep digges is bad just because the script requires him to be and there's the quaint notion that juvenile delinquents will turn into swell kids if they're just given a dash of autonomy but it's made in that spare fast style that the studio specialized in and it never bores frankie darro who got into all kinds of onscreen trouble during a brief tenure as warners' favorite rotten street kid is an ideal jd a handsome charismatic toughie with a pug nose and a hate filled stare that could wither steel no kid actor today can touch him
<START> not confusing in the sense that gee this movie is really complex and thus hard to follow but confusing in the sense that gee this movie really has no idea what it's doing br br dream of a warrior is a hong kong south korean collaboration but it's all utter nonsense a movie about parallel universes mixed in with time travel mixed in with love story mixed in with silliness br br the film has the type of concept that boggles the mind again not boggles the mind because it's so great and complex but boggles in the sense that it's so ridiculous and one can't conceive of anyone ever coming up with such an awful premise to begin with br br nothing in dream of a warrior makes sense and that's because the whole movie should never have been made it is quite awful the only saving grace is the actress who plays the female warrior not the female lead br br 3 out of 10
<START> it is so bad i can not tear myself away i keep asking myself why why with every scene br br there is no continuity but then again if you want to make a very overtly homosexual movie with a fetishistic attitude towards all things big big boats big boys big planes then you don't have to worry about things like plot or character i am baffled and very concerned that the looks so much like richard pryor it seems wrong to put a pryor look alike in such a terrible movie but i can't tear myself away this movie is the first movie i've ever reviewed that is how phenomenally bad and bizarre it is it motivated me to join this site i have counted 50 main characters perhaps if i was stoned i could follow this but as it is i feel like i'm in some kind of never ending bad dream where it is always 1988 and we were the greatest on earth
<START> i didn't see this movie when it originally came out but there has been a couple songs sharing the title and the term still gets used from time to time and i figured there must be something to the flick so i dug it up and gave a view now i would like the approximate hour and forty five minutes of my life back it seemed much longer there was nothing particularly bad about the movie the acting was good no large plot holes of course there wasn't much plot to have holes in there just wasn't a lot to the movie there was some chemistry between the two but nothing compelling about their relationship nothing interesting about their story near the end when he attempts to chase down the train to catch his fleeing romance neither my wife nor i wanted him to catch her honestly we figured they were better off with out each other and if they did get back together we really didn't care so what's that say about this love story when even a 25 year old sappy romantic like my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship i should have left this one in the missed category br br logan www com html
<START> this is one of my three all time favorite movies my only quibble is that the director peter yates had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene but the performances were so great i forgive him br br albert finney and tom are absolutely marvelous brilliant the script is great giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during world war ii and therefore what it was like in the 30s as well lots of great subtle touches lots of broad overplayed strokes all of it perfectly done scene after scene just blows me away and then there's the heartbreaking climax
<START> breaker morant and romper it has also given us watchable films such as and the odd angry shot unfortunately for everyone involved in this debacle the boy won't be joining appearing in either list br br i was looking forward to seeing this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on bbc 2 late at night the announcer didn't even mention the movie's name so i was expecting something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw was going to drop in disbelief it did drop in disbelief i found myself not being able to believe that the financiers thought this was going to be a major international hit br br the problem lies with the cast and the script i do know that australia with its small population doesn't have a large pool of actors so i'll be forgiving for the most part but this doesn't stop my criticism of nick as steve for this type of comedy to work you must be impressed with the comic skills of the lead actor and i'm sorry to say but nick g just doesn't have the skills i'd never heard of him and seen nothing else he's been in so perhaps he's much better at other performances here however he's just plain irritating unconvincing and i lost count at the number of times he mugged for the camera the jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and getting back to the script it seems very under developed i mean who thought a running gag about a female of work who's having it off in the back of a limousine was funny to begin with you do get the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said look mate this screenplay's not nearly good enough go and make it more subtle and structured br br i've been harsh and harshness has been called for in this review i gave the movie four out of ten and it would have only got three if it wasn't for the one genuinely funny sequence where steve is watching a current affairs show only for himself flashing up on screen and labelled a dole this shows that the screenwriters were aware of comic timing and social comment such a pity that they didn't come with a much better written movie
<START> as a documentary this is laughable in a campy sort of way a schlocky collection of re created biblical tableaux mixed in with solemn interviews of so called experts think of it as an which pushes jesus instead of thigh masters br br however the detailed crucifixion scene is in terms of historical accuracy superior to similar scenes in such widescreen hollywood extravaganzas as ben hur king of kings and the greatest story ever told rather than dragging his entire cross to for example john simply carries his strapped across his shoulders to his outstretched arms nails aren't driven through his palms but instead through his wrists his feet aren't nailed separately but one is placed over the other so that just one nail need be used incidentally flogging prior to his crucifixion ranks 35th in the book lash the hundred great scenes of men being whipped in the movies br br of course and the two thieves wear modest which probably isn't true to the shameful reality of roman crucifixions but allowances must be made curiously the good thief is positioned on the left hand of jesus which goes against a long standing tradition just why this thief is played by a pudgy overweight man is however a mystery especially in view of the fact that the bad thief is something of a hunk
<START> ok why complain about this movie it's fiction deal with it if you want to see the biography go watch it this is an original fictionalized version of what happened in wisconsin people who are obsessed will complain about this as they do every other deviation of the facts sad but true i think making kane hodder the man in which the film is named after was a great idea i thought it wasn't so good at first i'll be honest but that just made it even scarier if you like kane hodder ed gein or movies based on real events i think this is a good movie but if you're obsessed like some other people stay away from this movie and all others
