<START> there were so many reasons why this movie could have been great i'll give you three br br 1 sienna she is extremely hot in this movie and was the reason i chose to watch it in the first place br br 2 tim curry amazing bad guy and i always get excited seeing him in movies even home alone 2 br br 3 jason donovan for all you aussies and poms out there this is a rare treat former neighbours star 80's heart throb dressed in drag selling drugs br br however none of these things nor the fact that the movie is about the drug rave culture managed to make this movie even remotely interesting the script was dull the performances ordinary and despite the scenes with j d and any scene with sienna i found everything about this movie pretty passe br br 3 out of 10
<START> broadcast news is directed by james l brooks terms of endearment as good as it gets and has a great cast including william hurt albert brooks and holly hunter everyone gives a good performance but they're all too unlikable to really care about them br br some parts of the film are really brilliant such as the prologue and the short scenes with jack nicholson the main reason it doesn't entirely work is it's a film that relies on the characters being amusing rather than amusing things happening to them br br you could consider it nothing more than a drama but it's often too silly to be successful there as well still the script makes it worth a watch certainly not for everyone br br 7 0 out of 10
<START> this is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of china in the third century bc what makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the palace intrigue going on around him it reminded me a bit of king lear and some of the other shakespeare plays br br the king starts out with noble ambitions to unify the kingdoms under one ruler and to stop all the quarrelling so that the people can prosper and lead better lives he and his childhood sweetheart played beautifully by li gong concoct a scheme whereby she pretends to go into exile in a rival kingdom in order to recruit an assassin to kill the king thus giving him a pretext to go to war but while she's away the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and goes on a killing spree br br there are numerous side plots that keep the action going there is the marquis who pretends to be stupid and foppish but who's really very clever and wants to become king himself he fathers two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it secret for years then there is the prime minister a political rival to the king who turns out to really be his father br br the assassin is a complex character himself an adept swordsman and killer he is undergoing a when the king's lover comes to recruit him he wants nothing more with killing but is eventually won over by li gong who wouldn't be when he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become br br some spectacular cinematography especially the battle scenes that are carried out on a grand scale like they used to say a cast of thousands literally the acting is ok nothing special it's the story that's interesting though at over two and a half hours it pushes the limit br br definitely worth viewing
<START> sure most people will designate island of the as silly and trashy hokum but can you honestly name one other movie that brings forward this many exhilarating themes this italian gem stands for pure entertainment and features stuff like voodoo volcanic eruptions mutant fish creatures the mysterious continent of atlantis treasure hunting a remote island filled with death traps and utterly mad scientists all this and much more in one simple movie yes please close minded opponents of italian horror cinema can easily tag this film as a cheap exploitation version of the island of dr moreau but the truth is that this is so much more island of the delivers thrills and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and astonishingly stylish camera work the story promisingly opens with a small group of prisoners survivors of a shipwreck washing ashore a tropical island they encounter the sadistic edmond who rules over a native a legion of genetically created monsters that live in the island's swamps there are so many twists and additional sub plots in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary but trust me this gem is worth checking out sergio martino once again proves that he's an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be commercial minded and creative at the same time he makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior sets look very impressive the staggering underwater footage and imaginative scenery really lift this film high above the normal standards of late 70's exploitation i don't quite understand why roger corman reworked the original so much and released it on the american market under a different title because there are very few elements open for improvement the cast members are all sergio martino regulars with the exception of the great joseph cotton is a neat supportive rule and give away great performances in case you can get your hands on the recently restored german version you're treated to fifteen uncut minutes of extra action see it
<START> river's edge is more than just the story of a murder it's an indictment of the wave of apathy that has plagued pockets of youth for decades now our main characters are a group of what my high school would have referred to as stoners one of them just decided to strangle his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to talk sh t to him this dangerous young man played by daniel roebuck has an intensity that will startle you he takes the other kids in the group out to show them his girlfriend's body and strangely enough nobody seems really freaked out about it the balance of the film punctuates the desperate circumstances in which these people live and how guilt is eventually able to worm its way inside even these apathetic kids br br river's edge is certainly not condoning or championing the behavior of its characters we clearly see the dangers presented by such unchecked apathy and having only the desire to get drunk or high we are shown the dysfunctional home lives these kids have and perhaps this is meant to explain their awful behavior but could it only be unstable homes that lead to this type of destructive living crispin glover is his usual whacked out self he drives around town in a state of complete paranoia after the murder he tries to sympathize with why his friend had to commit the crime but clearly he does not understand what could have made the young man do it dennis hopper plays an older man these kids get their dope from though he is certainly a rebellious figure he cannot relate to the apathy and rage of the younger generation witness his confused reaction as roebuck describes how killing his girlfriend made him feel as wild as hopper's character is even he knows this young man should not be walking the face of the earth br br what will you think of these kids well there is really no way to like their characters some are less despicable than others but you cannot help either hating or feeling sorry for them twenty years later there is still an apathy alive and well in a great many young people out there when do these kids get lost what makes so many of them want to act anti social this film and the questions it poses about teenagers will stick with you for a while that's a fact br br 8 of 10 stars br br the hound
<START> i just saw everything is illuminated at the film festival this is a truly remarkable film very emotional funny at times and heart warming bring your handkerchiefs for those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes i'm reminded of the endings of babette's feast and the notebook the stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes just as this film did br br no spoilers here the summary is as imdb describes a young man's journey to the ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up br br the dialog is in english and ukrainian and russian too i believe this allows for some wonderfully linguistically based moments as one character interprets more or less faithfully for the english speaker in the group depending on the circumstances br br the scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful eastern european influences be sure you stay through the credits for the final tune br br this is directorial debut and is well done i give this film a 9 one of the best films i've seen in a long time i recommend it highly
<START> old ed was active back in the late 1950's he was apprehended 16 november 1957 the pr 24 police baton was invented in 1974 yet the cops in the movie are all carrying the pr 24 back then it would have been a standard billy club not the side handled pr 24 sheeze if you are gonna make movies do your research and get it right also it makes no mention of ed's usage of the bodies he tanned most of the skins and made various articles including a a belt and several masks he also had a large selection of shrunken heads that several local children knew about as he often babysat for them he was found incompetent and committed to the central state hospital for the criminally insane
<START> there are rumours that a fourth underworld is going to happen if so than the third part which is also a prequel would be in the middle of the franchise with prequels that succeed the original movies you always ask yourself in what order should you watch the movies so that it makes sense br br in this case i guess it doesn't matter that much the third underworld movie isn't up to par with the other two they had their obvious flaws too but this one lacks a few things and it feels like a cash in it seems like it's not going full throttle which is a shame because the actors sure could've used better material to work with br br the story is ok but it's nothing special a nice movie but couldn't fill the shoes of beckinsale yes she plays another character i mean the void that kate b left
<START> the film is a great watch very thoughtful i believe it is a film about how your like would be if you lived in a world created by catalogues the scenes are all perfect recreations of an ikea catalogue they even watch furniture on their tv when they break into the kitchen they break into another perfect picture of how a kitchen would look like in a catalogue when he is reborn or whatever you would like to call it he returns to the harsh reality of life i love the bit when he tells his new love he has left his partner it pokes fun at commercial bliss by saying you can have it all and whilst it it is nice to have the same things but some things you do not want to share a film without children also per say makes for a perfect ten
<START> i've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film it seemed dull to me much as i enjoyed looking at penelope cruz and the plot details often poorly worked out it also seemed like an intensely sexist film if the gender roles were reversed almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist it's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor are notoriously dull and this one turns out to be no exception but it's also interesting to notice what happens and here comes the plot giveaway though it refers to a very early scene when the teenage daughter kills her father 1 her mother rushes to take responsibility for it and 2 the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film it's not quite a glorified killing though camera lingers on the blood in a bloodthirsty way as though it makes an attractive painting and then it's soaked up and out of sight without bloodying either daughter or mom neither materially nor emotionally later the film reveals another killing again by a woman of a man and once again it is a killing which the film implicitly endorses in short is an ideologically driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a repugnant ideology and so i write an ideological critique but apart from that it's just not very interesting it has none of the depth of say talk to her which i loved
<START> no serious spoilers but some very minor ones br br a korean contribution to the ever popular asian horror wave concerns a husband and wife who decide that they're getting on a bit and decide to adopt a child the child who has an usual obsession with the dead tree in the family's garden eventually disappears when the couple eventually have a child of their own and the aforementioned tree seems to hold a grudge against the family itself br br and that's about it the film moves at a snails pace clocking in at over 100 minutes with 80 minute material it is essentially a thin family drama with a creepy tree and there is very little in the way of scares just shots of the tree with weird mumbling noises playing over the top however the idea of the tree being the child's mother is a pretty original one but it isn't exactly exploited to its full potential this sort of separates from much of the new wave it belongs to films like ju on and ring tend to do the opposite and milk bland ideas until they are red in the face br br the film does begin to get going towards the end however the realisation of the child's fate and the parent's actions not only the earlier curiosity of the story but are revealed with such machine gun editing that it's difficult to take in all at once the final sequence is undoubtedly creepy however it feels like too little too late br br overall the film does not feel too much like a ring cash in however with the film renaissance that korea is currently going through i couldn't help but feel this film could have been so much more
<START> check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasn't yet kicked in we get a pretty good look at super secret los just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end wwii except for the tight security it looks unthreatening enough note how it's a tv repairman an obvious regular guy who takes us through security once through it's like any town usa nice homes quiet streets kids going to school and a family tv on the blink later on we see little tommy and little peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates the movie appears to be saying okay we're tough only because we have to be but basically we're still just folks br br now i expect that was a comforting message to cold war audiences still not used to government's dooms day research it's a clear effort at popular reassurance the one darker note is when tommy's mother clarke worries about her son's mental state he doesn't say when i grow up instead it's if i grow up that note of doubt not only reflects a los reality but also a national one that in 1952 had just seen footage of the apocalyptic h bomb note too how professionally fbi agents are portrayed a standard feature of mccarthy era fare when brute force is needed it's not they but private citizen gene barry who thrashes out the early version i suppose of modern era rendition br br once the kidnapping occurs the suspense doesn't let up the intrigue is nicely handled with colorful la locations that keep us guessing the climactic scenes around the cliff dwellings may not be plausible as a hiding place but the view of northern new mexico is great then too the ancient stone apartments amount to one of the more exotic backdrops of the decade note also the extensive use of the police helicopter just coming into use as a law enforcement tool among an otherwise subdued cast nancy gates remains a sparkling presence as teacher ellen haskell never hollywood glamorous she was still a fine unsung actress and winning personality i also expect this was one of director hopper's more successful movie efforts and though people have since gotten used to the nuclear threat the movie remains a revealing and riveting document of its time
<START> you don't have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this film i watched it for the first time when i was nine having been a fan of the t v show and my parents laughed just as hard as i did it is done in the classic style of bugs bunny cartoons from yesterday and considering todays vulgar cartoons i would think anybody would appreciate a cartoon movie that relies more on wackiness then on vulgarity to get a few laughs
<START> this is a piece of hollywood product that should have never left a film can dialogue without a plausible thought plot without a point staging without skill directing without direction and acting without the worth of some backwater high school's freshman class play the entire cast should have been arrested for over acting br br but otherwise okay
<START> in hoot mullet fingers is engaging in sabotage to stop the pancake house the problem is that the builders just start over again and he has to take more drastic measures when he is confronted with the dogs he scares them off with snakes not before he is bitten by a dog and has to go to hospital br br roy at bedtime asks his father who works with the department of justice how he deals with crooks his father says it involves the tedious steps of looking through papers because sooner or later they all slip up you can see this with enron and roy looks at documents relating to the pancake house and finds a suppressed document he does have to break in to the company trailer so when the police see it he has the law on his side unlike when he the police br br mind you as mentioned before roy is not always law abiding and when the company man is killing owls illegally mullet fingers takes direct action he can't wait for the law mullet fingers is in hiding the movie does suggest that one should work in the system
