<START> pixote is the one of most powerful shocking and moving motion picture to come from brazil it's about the lives of street kids on the streets of sao paulo and rio de janeiro and it centers around a ten year old boy the camera follows them around in an almost documentary style from the juvenile detention center where most of the staff is as corrupt as the police and back to the streets and it never turns away from the horrors of the city prostitution drug use dealing corruption and murder are all witnessed by these youths yet it's something they're painfully used to director hector used real street kids as the actors adding to the films brutal reality although not for everyone a film i highly recommend an emotionally devastating movie br br
<START> one night on an independent channel famous for showing off the wall films was aired this monstrosity though tempted to turn it off we watched it to the bitter end hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value alas there was none absolutely nothing the film quality was cheap the soundtrack was muddy the editing was ridiculous then again there was precious little to salvage after a few minutes of cameron mitchell's doctor character narrating about some patient of his the viewer is tortured by no plot pathetic writing abysmally terrible acting and an utter lack of cohesion and continuity the rotting cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrendous special effects and makeup to ever disgrace the screen even for television the main character stumbles through his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of gloves which appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled in beads perhaps the poor lighting and gag worthy film quality were attempting to cover up how bad to the tenth power the makeup was one can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video seriously a handful of three year old kids could've produced a better project at the end poor mr mitchell returns how desperate he must've been for money and drones out some nonsense that's supposed to connect this pile of crap with the aids epidemic please spare you and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this it was so bad even mystery science theater 3000 couldn't have salvaged it
<START> this movie is nothing more than christian propaganda it started off like a good sci fi movie and then works a syrupy sweet christian theme into the story which is totally unrelated i had to turn it off half way through because i felt tricked into renting it the catholic church has officially announced that aliens do not contradict belief in god br br the movie is slightly entertaining despite this but the dialog is unbelievable writing and acting is mostly rubbish and all in all this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided br br there was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject if you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels you will love this movie
<START> i'm not american but meatballs still really hits me maybe because it's a sweet sweet movie watching it again today made me sentimental for a time i can't really put my finger on and a place i can't quite remember br br meatballs is just a great movie it reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possible br br if you're reading this you probably know what i mean br br all i can say on top of what i've already said is that meatballs must be even more nostalgic if you're american br br i guess you know what i mean by that too
<START> this is another enjoyable and entertaining hitchcock film james stewart and doris day are incredible in this movie bernard herrmann appears as himself near the climax br br the scenery and locations are great except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake which doesn't make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots i've heard that hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes br br the reviews for this movie seem to be mixed i think this is a better than average hitchcock movie very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end br br i rated this movie 8 out of 10 br br
<START> they've shown i twice in a very short time now here in sweden and i am so very tired of it the bad acting isn't enough the story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists i love the original from 1953 so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead because this one is such a bore
<START> good boring or bad it's good worth your money if you can spare it for a ticket sure better than the trailer makes it seem yes oddly br br there isn't much to the script guards working at armored truck company move vast amounts of cash guards see opportunity to retire as millionaires one of them is too honest to go along with it all and a well laid plan goes to hell br br this could have been a poorly executed reservoir dogs ripoff but the skill of the cast and the director's ability to make just about anything tense pull it out of that realm and put it onto a solid footing
<START> the worse film i have every seen like the other honest reviewers it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their out don't get wrong naked women isn't a bad thing but there is another film genre for that br br boyfriends beware i sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang fest due to reviews to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women gyrating about the place slap in the chops for me br br what makes me laugh the most is all the bike dives they went to in the film were full of models with the works cosmetically what biker bars have these they are usually slightly haggard with tattoos and far completely unrealistic the acting is terrible loads of pointless swearing and a complete waste of time storyline br br did anyone check out vinnie jones's attempt at an american accent its as embarrassing as his football skills br br avoid like the plague the only reason you would watch this film is if you are a young lad who cant access p rn and have nicked it from their parents movie collection for a few pervy kicks
<START> 2001 a space odyssey is set in 2001 and the main character is hal a computer that's right a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own this was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke if this was in a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this there is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion it provokes two reactions and one is called sleep it starts with nothing but a pitch black shot for well over two minutes then the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is the dawn of man sequence so if it's in chronological order the blackness prior to this is the birth of the world br br during the dawn of man sequence out of no where a huge monolith comes out of the ground from the sky we'll never know where it comes from but for one reason or another it's there the monkeys go t once they find this monolith that only man could have made but that's the man hasn't evolved yet so who made it and where did it come from what is its purpose the monkeys find a tool the monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys the monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group because they have used their mind to gain an advantage the more advanced monkeys and more importantly smarter and more innovative monkeys are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole br br we quickly jump into space millions of years later where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music we can see the earth the moon the sun the universe and for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning but outdated the score is legendary the cinematography is spectacular the editing is atrocious there are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for what feels like an infinite amount of time once we board the ship there isn't much to talk about for the next hour kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut which is very boring and we completely get the message the spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking remember what the first cell phone looked like me neither but that's what the future looks like in 2001 all the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble 1968 the chairs are decorated in bright red colors and oddly shaped because we all know in the future we're going to be sitting in weird looking chairs the computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to hdtv because the clarity is atrocious all the tv sets look like they're from 1968 so it's not all that futuristic like all films set more than 20 years in advance they look terrible and unconvincing just because this is kubrick we shouldn't say well that's how you would think it looks no i wouldn't just like i wouldn't think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047 it's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now set 30 years in time and had a talking self thinking computer i would laugh at the stupidity of it just like i did with 2001 br br hal is the liveliest person i just called him a person hal is a computer but he has more life than any of the muted characters in the film and he actually thinks he's alive hal is the only thing that's lively and he sees the humans as his maintenance men taking care of him while he does all the work hal reads the lips of one of the very few conversations between dave and frank and he sees that they are planning to turn him off this is where the only dramatic part of the film enters an ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into the bigger spaceship oh the drama once hal thinks he has the upper hand dave makes his way back into the spaceship proving mans ingenuity dave proceeds to terminate hal hal pleads for his life as he slowly fades away which like everything else seems to take forever br br the final act is just as tedious as the first two once again the monolith that the apes found appears at the end it comes out of nowhere again then an infant is born in a placenta like shield overlooking the earth from space what is kubrick saying is it about transformation dave to an infant is man evolving again is kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start ofÂ whatever that alien looking thing is maybe i'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say but the more i think about the more the beginning and the ending make sense there are so many questions left unanswered especially for the purpose of the monolith if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought br br in the end the film struggles with getting to where it wants go the first act and the third acts are strong but the second act meanders around hovering in one place for what seems like eternity there is some intriguing stuff in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance once the start of the film makes sense the ending works much better even if you still don't what kubrick is trying to say which i don't
<START> this movie deserves the 10 i'm giving it br br but it's not the 10 that you'd give to movies like 'the godfather' or 'goodfellas' or 'psycho' this is the kind of 10 you give to a movie which just makes you laugh over and over again it's the most horribly written and directed movie yet it doesn't fail to entertain it has the most amateur effects yet you enjoy every moment i saw this movie today on tv and i didn't want to move away read the following dialogue to know why br br whole college is standing around who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness br br bad guy 1 please forgive us br br bad guy 2 yes we won't do it again br br no response from br br akshay come on forgive them br br i don't know br br akshay you are a beautiful woman and even dead men can get aroused by you and these are living young males don't blame them br br yeah br br to what if they tried to rape your girlfriend br br i'd break their hands legs and kill them but anyways just forgive them br br akshay yeah if you don't forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty br br now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue this movie never fails to entertain mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations the bad guy can do basically anything he can blow a sandstorm from his mouth or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again br br every actor takes turns to speak one line from akshay then from then from arshad then then it's the main rule followed by the director so that equal screen time is given to each guy and then there's the all powerful pendant which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed all these things make it an enjoyable movie and i can watch it over and over again i think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one br br the only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny
<START> the first opening scene that lasted around five minutes showed the potential of becoming an instant classic with to good acting good film a story that keep the volume up and an in the corner the of screen a spooky did you see that the scarecrow moves br br after the quick set up of history that would come into the present it was like someone else had written and directed the rest of the film the next scene is a basic outline of how the film goes downhill like a runaway truck it looks like the rest was shot in video with crappy porn style actors the set design was a lawyers office with practically nothing on the or anything in the office at all br br i remember only watching crap horror films for a chance of seeing some naked teenage girls back then there weren't victoria's secret mags everywhere and not watching for things that make great horror films of today like acting terror suspense and so on br br it took nearly fifty minutes for the first person to die when it did me and and my friends were so shocked by the worst costume of a monster ever we through our popcorn at the tv screen booing
<START> before hitting international acclaim with the silence of the lambs director jonathan demme cut his teeth making quirky comedies this was one of them and like quite a few oscar winning american comedies i could mention it has a fine concept is well paced has great performances a complicated romance but it just simply isn't very funny pfeiffer is mob widow who moves to the city after her husband baldwin is murdered the crime boss who killed him stockwell takes a fancy to pfeiffer his wife is furious and to complicate matters pfeiffer also falls for the cop who is trailing her all of this should have been a laugh a minute pfeiffer sporting a hefty wig is excellent as the widow as is the hyperactive ruehl and modine is good too as the nice cop but the script is simply devoid of one liners wit humour or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film demands the result is it raises smiles at best rather than guffaws it oozes charm but is tediously short on humour
<START> totally genius film from the crew not the jackass boys johnny knoxville chris pontius steve o etc are not in this br br film ok so maybe they'r not the best actors but its not what you call a serious film but hey there fun and its totally funny to watch who doesn't want to see don vito dressed as a roman emperor br br a total must if you like viva la bam or an amazing soundtrack provided by the almighty him and others check out the extra features on the dvd especially freestyle br br chinese rap number two seriously hilarious check this film out you wont regret it 10 10
<START> i had no expectations when i started to watch this movie how surprised i was this is a great beautiful twisted movie which will give your mind a good work out it's not simple if you only enjoy police academy style no brains movies this is not for you the cell is a deep complex film with influences from movies like cube silence of the lambs and the lawnmower man along with lots of completely new ideas wonderful twisted environments good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films i have seen in a long time be open minded and you will love it
<START> these were two video shot movies that decided were horrible so in a desperate move turned into this one movie perhaps the bitterness on side helped spark the comedy but for whatever reason this is very funny stuff with an inspired bit with oliver stone doing commentary during the movie lots of cameos lots of use of the lesbian cannibal song add to the fun trey parker ted raimi julie strain etc etc br br one of the best of recent releases yes it's all over the place know that going in the production quality or lack of becomes one of the many running jokes go with it and you'll be in for a good time br br the behind the scenes frequently the best things about releases are also above average this time around i really think the anger they felt over these two lousy films helped drive them to well not greatness but drove them to fix this film in a way that's better than either of the films would have been as they were originally planned
