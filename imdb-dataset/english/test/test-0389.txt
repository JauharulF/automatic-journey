<START> i really wanted to like this movie the previews looked marginally funny but i figured they put most of the funny stuff in the previews in this case they not only did that but they twisted the clips so that they appeared much funnier than they were in the real film i like john travolta uma thurman vince vaughn the rock cedric the entertainer etc so i wanted to like this movie but it just never seemed to do anything br br i saw get shorty and did not particularly care for it too slow and unfunny for me this movie is certainly no better and if anything is worse there were a lot of opportunities for some good comedic moments but it took none of them br br the acting was okay but even john travolta seemed toned down cedric was okay but he was too reigned in to be really funny vince vaughn and the rock were pretty good and ready to be funny but they just let it all pass them by i wish they had been given a chance to follow through with the funny things they set up but instead it just kept going back to the same old thing and back to just setting vaughn and rock up to be funny though never allowed to really deliver that punchline or comedy br br overall this was a very disappointing movie and i am glad i only saw it on video at least it was cheaper than the theater
<START> why bother itv admittedly mansfield park is the most difficult of the novels to get and fanny is certainly the hardest to like but if one is going to take it on then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit and for heaven's sake have the guts to cast fanny as she was written a prissy good hearted sweetish whiner mrs norris wasn't nearly as awful as she should have been and what the heck happened to the contrast between fanny's rather dubious family and family home and the splendors of mansfield is key to well so many aspects of fanny's refusal of henry her uncle's rejection henry's near transformation to a good person etc etc again given the complexity and challenges of the novel why did they bother it's beyond me
<START> there are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film suffice it to say that alex cord plays a strong lead opposite robert ryan and arthur kennedy what concerns me is that many of you may not be aware of the at least two existing versions of this film in the u s version clay mccord gains amnesty from governor carter and then rides out of town redeemed i agree that ending is less than satisfying however in the original italian cut clay mccord rides out of town as he has turned in his pistols to the governor and is by the bounty hunters that have been slowly the bandit town of the bounty killers are excited at the prospect of splitting the 10 000 reward but are disappointed to find amnesty agreement in the corpses pocket as they ride away one is heard to comment if this amnesty keeps up i'm gonna start hunting buffalo this alone takes a minute to pray a second to die and places it on an even playing field with movies like keoma and the big as the end credits say in the italian cut fine
<START> first off i'm in the u s br br when i first saw this i thought it was an obvious and loathsome rip off of the office uk i would have thus awarded it zero stars but lo and behold it came out long before the ricky gervais series br br still it's hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic including the american office without comparison it just isn't even close to being the same thing br br i will give it some credit for being original and ahead of its time i'll also say that it and the u s office and larry sanders are actual satires the uk office is something grander and more transcendent as if populated with real people in events that felt like they actually happened however unlike this or the shrill christopher guest mockumentaries it isn't really a satire while the definitely is br br be that as it may the still isn't very funny it's aloof and self aware but with a cast and crew not nearly smart or talented enough to heft the goods it's weighty comedy being carried on weak shoulders commendable but ultimately not recommended br br and what's with the lack of an anamorphic dvd i know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen because i saw the pilot episode on one of our hd channels cbc get with the programme
<START> a classic 80's movie that disney for some reason stopped making i watched this movie everyday when i was in like 6th grade i found a copy myself after scouring video stores well worth it though one of my all time
<START> i don't see why all the people are giving this film negative reviews i loved this movie bled is a form of abstract art and if you don't appreciate art i can see why you would not like this film it was a great twist from the average played out vampire movie if you are looking for a fresh new and ingenious new vampire movie then this is for you but if you want one of those turn into bats wolves and melt in the sunlight movies then go watch your old played out dracula flicks sure it is a bit on the low budget side but they did a great job with the budget they had i'm very happy that i found this movie because i was about to give up on the vampire genre fro good i thought this film was brilliant i give 2 thumbs up to the writer director and everyone involved in the film
<START> if it wasn't for colin firth the movie would be ready for the dust bin so so silly and so badly acted only colin firth as always shines through this mess as single light on the end of the tunnel br br the worst was jennifer rubin's acting for sure maybe it was because of this script did they actually have really written one or was it just made up on the way br br to cut a tooo long story short br br it is a must see only for colin firth fanatics like me since he is incredibly sexy and good acting struggling hard against this mentally challenged script these minutes of colin screen time make up a lot of this movie br br don't spend too much money on it though try to see or get it as cheap as possible an auction or something like that and then do stick to the colin firth scenes br br the rest of the movie might be dangerous for anyones mental health
<START> i saw bon voyage 2 days ago and i found it an excellent production the film is supposed to entertain and it does it emulates the style of the american screwball comedies of the 30s but von voyage is more refined adjani and depardieu are simply excellent in their roles the plot is simple the film starts with people involved in many situations that apparently should have nothing to do between them it is very funny how those situations become linked during the film it is good to see a french film with this kind of sense of humor i find it principally a film in which love is the main theme peter coyote as the german spy in france shows once more to be an excellent actor too
<START> this movie has the distinction of being the worst movie i have ever seen and the only film i have ever given a 1 out of 10 on imdb as of yet i was fooled into renting it because of the cool h r giger cover art on the box this cover art is the only thing the least bit good about this steaming pile of br br it was about frat boys fighting freaks in a strange but not the least bit interesting post apocalyptic world where the cities are in ruins chaos but apparently the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young men to haze other men into braindead frat organizations the most uninspiring performances by boring characters not so special effects dreary un original scenery and just generally extremely poor quality in all production aspects make this lemon the all time loser on my list br br final rating 1 10 i wish i could give it a zero br br noob
<START> this movie is great from start to finish about a group of med students that get together and literally kill each other by stopping their hearts and then revive themselves they then research what happens from the near death experiences as each one goes through the experience they become haunted by their deepest fears that seem to materialize as reality this ranges from dead kids with hockey sticks to dead fathers that seem to be upstairs br br the cast is first rate and oliver platt is hilarious in one of the best roles of his career i am not a big keifer sutherland fan but even he does an excellent job this is a movie that i can watch over and over
<START> the basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage a trois fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience br br it's really rather messy though fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat edged rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves br br the dialogue is inconsistent stagey here vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clichÃ© though there is no over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces there's also a very prosaic dare i say it british feel to the filming i didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation i wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story br br finally it is in fact the story which lets the rest down just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes woven as a vehicle for character examination wilkinson and watson support this meta essay with good performances and john ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow br br i'm disappointed not that it's bad but that it could have been much better 3 10
<START> so wynorski remakes curse of the komodo a second time this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists anti capitalists and he adds a cobra most of the movie is spent listening to the self righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there dna experiments were conducted critters started to grow people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks etc needless to say it would have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks the movie and forgotten about the sanctimonious do gooders lest i forget there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holier than thou posse gets picked off one by one but they probably comprise less than 2 of the film the main event pitting our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest dino crisis video game br br the acting is pretty bad overall even for this sort of film half the actors seem like they're more concerned with pronouncing every last syllable of every word than speaking their dialog in any sort of believable manner br br i actually did make it through to the end but it's one of those movies i wish i would have recorded and then watched later because there are plenty of parts that need to be fast forwarded through overall i give this effort one star it has absolutely none of the elements that make a b movie fun to watch it's a sad day indeed when you can say with sincerity that the makers of this movie could have learned a thing or two from watching boa vs python
<START> put the film down and back slowly away the acting rivals a highschool play the plot is and the production values are slightly higher than community theater the goofs are so plentiful that it becomes a laugher rooms are switched around the dead move dogs are used for wolves men shot point blank with 45 caliber pistols are able to walk and ride snowmobiles blouses button and without human touch this is a movie i nearly passed out when i saw the average rating there is no accounting for taste btw there is no nudity
<START> i happened to catch this on tv and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based i was very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that it's not exactly an a list production gregory hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great actor br br in fact all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director who is this film's weakest link charles seemed to be trying to ape oliver stone's jfk in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the real child murderer s but without the benefit of a good script an a list cast or it must be said the talent it just doesn't work br br it's a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment
<START> i really hope the makers of these movies read these reviews so that they know that people just dont want their movies they are just trash and an embarrassment to the killer clown genre of horror whether or not this was better than the first doesn't matter cause both just plain terrible i'm surprised they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie stop now warning to horror movie watchers dont watch rent or look at the boxes of urban horror films and above all don't buy them
