<START> the mtv sci fi animated series flux is brought to life with charlize theron playing the title character a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of 400 hundred years into the future for her latest mission she has been sent to kill the city's leader trevor marton csokas but she uncovers secrets along the way br br aeon flux falls under the category of good premise mediocre execution interesting story yet the film was a little dull a lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all it may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best i have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so i can't compare the two it's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more the film is not that confusing but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material the acting was alright nothing special charlize theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film the rest of the cast also give decent performances including jonny lee miller frances and marton csokas there are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including friend br br the problem with aeon flux is that it takes itself too seriously it carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring there's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times this is the same problem that elektra had because the film is so serious the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced the action scenes are pretty good but that's not what the film is really about so don't go in expecting just an action movie the twist at the end isn't mind blowing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year hide and seek the costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting the visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice so the movie may be a case of style over substance interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time in the end it's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental rating 4 10
<START> if you can watch a bond film from 1983 that isn't as good as octopussy and still enjoy it br br if you can accept production values which aren't that much above the level of a tv movie br br if you can look at sean connery with wrinkles on his forehead beneath an obvious and still see james bond br br if you can get past an inexperienced basinger a weaker largo and a jolly q br br if you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score not up there with barry on his worst day br br if you don't believe the hyperbolic reviews that it was greeted with on release br br if you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same br br yours is never say never again and everything that's in it br br and what is more you'll probably enjoy it my son
<START> eddie murphy and richard pryor team up in this would be comedy about nightclub owners being squeezed by organized crime eddie murphy wrote and directed this obnoxious ego trip and therefore has no one to blame but himself for its failure this is a genuinely bad film so completely devoid of energy and humor that it serves only as a example of murphy's contempt for his audience it would be remarkably easy to continue beating up on this movie but i will show it more mercy than it showed its audience and stop now
<START> franco nero stars as cole a ninja who comes to the rescue of his war buddy frank landers alex courtney and his fetching wife susan george to protect them from a mobster christopher george who wants the land things get even more complicated when the mobster hires cole's old nemesis sho kosugi who is also a ninja inept martial arts actioner while having better production values then most ninja movies fails to inject any life into the surroundings or for that matter actionscenes a poor effort all around
<START> in my opinion the directing editing lighting and acting minus franco were very good i must admit i was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film i wasn't expecting much in way of camera angles sound etc but in these areas the film wasn't bad at all br br after seeing the film i personally felt frustrated with both characters because i wanted so badly for these two characters to reach out to one another and i felt like the travis franco character wasn't really affected or changed in the end after terri commits suicide although this is probably due to the lack or inability of james franco to express emotion of any kind very well in this movie i've seen a few of franco's other films and to me he just can't pull it off when a scene calls for real emotion or facial expressions the only positive he brings to the film is the possibility of more people watching this movie br br on the other hand rachel miner's portrayal of terri was well done and she looks to have a bright future ahead i could really see and feel the sadness and emptiness in her character and it made me feel for her i only wish i could have seen more into terri's life before the film ended br br for a short film this movie was good but it leaves you wanting more in the end i only wish it could have been just a bit longer to see the characters develop a little more in spite of that i hope to see more films from the director and crew in the future
<START> this is at least very close to a perfect video publication messianic metal group dinosaurs of rock n' roll biggest and most influential heavy band in the world plays their hit songs and reminisces band's past what more do we need br br video starts from war pigs and ends to paranoid and in the middle all the greatest and most significant classics of the original line up are included electric funeral sweet leaf after forever iron man children of the grave and of course my personal favourite into the void i'm glad they didn't leave it out well how could they br br still this video is more than just the music ozzy osbourne tony geezer butler and bill ward goes over the group's colorful history only thing that slightly bothers me is when a live song is being interrupted with bits of interview for example is it that necessary to inform how the song n i b got it's name right in the middle of it one on top of the other i doubt it's still a small flaw so it's not too big deal br br band members also around in chairs and chat together pleasant material for a sabbath fan i admit i have difficulties of following what ozzy osbourne is muttering but it's just amusing i had a privilege to participate when the last supper tour entered finland and for me personally this video is an ideal way to recall that magnificent show
<START> an arab american man is kidnapped from an american airport and flown to somewhere in north africa where he is tortured the reason his cell phone received a call from a known terrorist the cia decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is implication of guilt or just a mistake after watching this movie we can only but pray some terrorist doesn't accidentally punch in a wrong number br br in addition to the rendition there are several related side stories one involves the daughter of the chief of intel secret police who is torturing the suspect and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide bombers this story is way too contrived but nevertheless intriguing especially when we see it's outcome the director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience br br the second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband she gets an old lover to help he a muted saarsgard is aide de camp to a senator alda and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his job isn't worth uncovering the truth witherspoon is wasted in this role all she gets to do is look forlorn and pregnant with one brief rage attack streep is good and cold and stereotypical as the govt cia nsa homeland sec official who seems to be a cheney clone br br also is wasted as a minor analyst pushed into in area he's over his head in although he gets to do the right thing in the end br br i found the movie engrossing if somewhat languorous but thought it added little to the subject it is certainly not to be viewed as definitive and it certainly has an axe to grind like the kingdom it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject br br the movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition but can only end up by being a cautionary tale about one botched one the whole point of rendition is not to torture but to get terror suspects to give intel by avoiding legal therefore obstructive barriers torture for sure may be employed especially if the rendition is out of our hands although we are obviously not in this matter but intel that can save lives is vital in this shadow war

<START> if you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place it is fast paced and funny with some decent acting from the characters it is always hard for me to see mark as anything except marky mark that image is burned in my mind forever as an actor though he is pretty good this movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns i will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it

<START> this is probably the best movie filmed in at least the last five years i've always believed that making people cry is far more difficult than making them laugh if you want to see 400 adults crying out loud in the same room go see this movie it's breathtaking javier bardem performs the role of his life you will cry you will laugh you will smile the most deserving fact is that in spain everybody knows about ramon personally i knew the full story and even the end of it so the excellence of the movie is in the way that the story is told and in this field amenabar is a the master br br this movie is a must
<START> wallace gromit have been around for some time but this was their first foray onto the silver screen fans of the british tv series like myself were eager to see them and the film did quite well in the theaters much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original in a world of cg movies like shrek and toy story this stop motion film is a nice alternative to the trend in children's movies as well as being totally unlike a cartoon plus compared to much earlier stop motion films such as king kong and the ray harryhausen films such as sinbad the quality and movement of the characters are light years better looking very fluid natural and more alive br br apart from the quality of the animation this movie also deserves kudos on every other level first the voice actors do a great job second the script is very simple but also very cute and enjoyable with a few double entendres that should probably go way over the kids' heads third they manage to make this not only a movie for kids but people of all ages as the film is neither saccharine nor aimed solely at the younger crowd in particular i was captivated by incredibly cute the film was and especially the adorable bunnies i especially liked them in the closing credits which made me very happy i stayed to watch the entire film br br the bottom line is that unless you are a real stick in the mud you will enjoy this film it's fresh funny and amazingly clever i hope we see a sequel and this is saying something as i usually hate sequels
<START> i just discovered this film and love it just the right mix of fast moving story entertaining characters hilarious moments but not overloaded with stupid jokes and fun performances by kelsey grammar harry dean stanton ron schneider rip torn and more is especially good and i really enjoyed watching the guy who played br br i also find it interesting that they used a real submarine the for the running on top scenes and emulated it almost exactly for their sets the set decoration is really impressive if you do a digital tour of the online and then compare it to scenes in the movie they did an excellent job on this film br br what a light entertaining and truly enjoyable movie
