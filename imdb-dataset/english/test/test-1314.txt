<START> greetings moviegoers as i watch octopus ii i contemplate the inherent lameness of the octopus croc dino horror genre many moviegoers may blame the poor acting nonsensical screenplay or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the ocd movie to flounder these reasons may indeed be floundering factors but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an ocd movie that is at the heart of the lameness br br you see the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic life size ocd and the cgi technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters even with clever cinematography you can only film the semi dark depths of the sea semi dark forest semi dark cave semi dark corridor so many times before the sci fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely the ocd sub genre that is br br what can be done you ask i wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness but another avenue needs to be explored we can't really go back to the days of the fade to black cue that someone has been killed or can we if we can't reach the goal of realism we have to compensate in other ways such as plot twists innuendo and photo ingenuity br br it will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness so common to the ocd sub genre will be cured
<START> if you're tired by the same repetitive unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases you'll enjoy you are alone it is thought provoking well shot and riveting br br without revealing anything that you don't find out in the first few minutes of the movie this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor the vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come br br through their discussion you explore two shifting views of prostitution depression loneliness yet the movie is not depressing it talks about dark things without being depressing br br as a viewer your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around but gently you come out of it with a lot to think about i like that in a movie
<START> this was one of the first color films i have seen at the cinema when i was a child it is good to remember it the girl liz taylor who later became a beautiful woman starred together with the tiny and excellent actor mickey rooney the content of the film plot is good for all ages good wills and behavior good ethics of parents particularly her mother is something to take into account our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose velvet loves the horses and racing them and mi taylor rooney brought her to an international horse racing competition in england where at the end the young velvet won but was disqualified because of being female
<START> i ordered this movie on the internet as it is very difficult to get turkish movies where we live i've heard so much about the tv series from my friends and practically everyone in turkey i was expecting to see a breakthrough in turkish cinema what a disappointment br br me and my husband who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of turkish landscape and turkish dialogues in it only watched it all the way through because we had paid 20 for the dvd well that was a boring way of wasting it br br it was confusing at times overacted whereas other times underacted the storyline was not only confusing but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it 'hollywood' didn't also work for me br br the american characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and like another user mentioned the turkish customs and lifestyle was irrelevant br br the camera movements had no significance adding a few never seen in them in by the way and broken plates greek style only made the movie even more confusing br br i am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it there are surely worthy movies made by turkish directors which deserve more attention and respect br br i give this movie 1 out of 10
<START> scarlet dawn casts douglas fairbanks jr as a russian baron rudely displaced by the forces of the russian revolution and now has to fend for himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats he's also not terribly suited for any kind of real work br br doug might have been caught by the reds but for the fact that his former servant nancy carroll didn't give him away nancy's got a big old crush on doug and they do marry once arriving in exile in istanbul which throughout the film is referred to by its former christian name of they marry and settle down with doug now reduced to washing dishes br br but former mistress who's always playing bad girls of a sort on film spots him and offers to have him get back into somewhat the style he was once accustomed to as part of a swindle against father and daughter american tourists guy kibbee and sheila terry br br good thing this film has the incredibly short running time of only 57 minutes usually those were given to b westerns because it's both tedious and melodramatic the ending is rather unbelievable doug knew he was in a thanksgiving special and really overacts to cover up the defects of a unbelievable story br br what i didn't understand was that fairbanks was trained in the military profession why didn't he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new soviet union that didn't make sense to me at all br br i'd only see this if i was a dedicated fan of any the main players
<START> i got stuck in traffic i live in sicily on the way to the theater at a military base to see superman returns was 15 minutes late and the only other movie playing was see no evil there was no poster up for it and just a short description of the movie on the schedule but my girlfriend and i decided to check it out as soon as i saw it was produced by wwe i just knew it was gonna be awful the few people in the theater were laughing most of the time and it was the first movie that i honestly considered walking out on and i've seen the ringer okay i would have walked out of that one but i was too busy sleeping the death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good but other than that it was just stupid
<START> dude i liked buffy and angel as much as the next sci fi freak but this is too much the worst lead actress ever not even david hot pants boreanaz is able to save this crap no wonder i never watch fox Â it blows we totally gave it a chance and it continued to suck we watched four or five painful agonizing episodes i want to kill the execs at the network so bad why is money being spent on this drivel i don't get it and i don't support it and you should never waste your time watching this show unless you like it when your eyes bleed from their sockets br br crap crap crap

<START> let me just say i love the horror genre to the extent that i see every single one that i can get my hands on regardless except really low quality b movie horrors which i could do without and recently have become a big fan of eastern horrors little did i know that a korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off heavyweights such as the japanese ringu or the american ring or even quality us movies such as the sixth sense and the others and the widely acclaimed hong kong horror 'the eye' br br previously 'the had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that i prefer the beauty of 'the tale of two sisters' any day the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you'll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date the acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to rattle you like anything within the ring i did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off br br still i am glad it didn't come back to haunt me later that samara did from the ring after all such feelings are unpleasant and the tale of two sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling but one that hopefully won't leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special but do remember if you don't understand the plot after the first viewing a repeat viewing is more than advised i personally didn't have time for this since it was late so i flicked through scenes on the dvd some numerous times until i had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net seemed pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation and the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful br br all in all a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same remake its been purchased by dreamworks simply because of the korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on dvds while they can its one of the best you will get unfortunately due to the type of movie this is there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what i did watch it without knowing a single thing except its 'a tale of two sisters' and be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time
<START> i was extraordinarily impressed by this film it's one of the best sports films i've every seen the visuals in this film are outstanding i love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup the film moves well offering both excitement and drama the cinematography was fantastic br br the acting performances are great i was surprised by young shia labeouf he does well in this role stephen is also good as the brooding harry peter firth justin and elias koteas offer able support the film is gripping and entertaining and for the first time in my life actually made me want to watch a golf tournament
<START> br br average adventure movie that took a serious story and it the watering down effect done particularly towards the average script snatched away this movie's place as a would be solid classic why water down such a great storyline probably because it deals with sensitive colonial subject matters and the producers do not want to create political heat just quick profits thank you the directing cinematography and soundtrack and acting was good the screenplay was average the charm of connery made up for his wrong arabic accent and all the scenes with president t roosevelt were masterpiece takes the costumes sets here was very good too bad we did not get more of a serious historical drama since this is what the story demands only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance adventure movies
<START> i will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100 if perfect br br visual pleasure 100 this is extremely pleasing movie visually i had a great time watching it golfing scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing i also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag br br director's work 70 bill paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows he's got talent did a decent job br br acting 90 shia lebeouf was very good in his role of francis this guy can act well the rest of the cast was also good br br entertainment value 100 i enjoyed every minute of it it was overwhelmingly entertaining br br script 91 based on a true story and therefore it makes the film that much more special it was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end br br br br my advice definitely a must watch for all the sports lovers especially golf you all will love it anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and doesn't hate sports can watch it br br br br 10 10
<START> i am new at this so bear with me please i am a big fan of surface i thought the script and the computer graphics were exceptional as good as any sci fi flick i've seen at the theater in february the tv guide said season finale the announcer for the show said something to the effect of and now for the season finale of surface season finale not series finale i couldn't wait for fall to get here to see was going to happen next so fall gets here and it's nowhere to be found if nbc isn't going to pick it up what about sci fi or usa it seems to me that bay watch didn't last long on abc then usa picked it up and it went gang busters i bet abc was chocking ha if not a series then at least a mini series to give all us loyal fans closure what happened to our guy's trapped in the church steeple was the creature in the did he have a does the cloned guy come over to our side there are so many unanswered questions thank's for listening to me babble
<START> while some of the things in haggard are dumb and unnecessary the overall package is good br br haggard follows ryan dunn and his friends bam and falcone brandon trying to win back ryan's ex br br the story is followed and developed surprisingly well it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of jackass or viva la bam although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story br br and for all the bam fan boys and girls there are multiple sequences of bam skateboarding perhaps the weakest aspect of the film phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances even don vito got a bigger but pointless roll br br if you are hoping to see a comedy and escape craziness then stay away from this movie otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it if you can find it there are some truly funny scenes in this film
<START> happy days was produced and broadcast from the mid 1970's to the early 1980's and seems to get more ridiculous with age at the time of its broadcast most viewers who grew up in the 1950's were in middle age with families and the scenes at mel's diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them the fonz was of course the coolest of the cool although the actor henry wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle richie cunningham was the all american blond haired kid who would probably be elected student body president was richie's best friend the star of the show has to have a best friend i guess and ralph was the bumbling sidekick to the fonz if not the entire group i loved it when the fonz would beat up on poor ralph and there was mel the middle aged lug who ran mel's diner and of course who could forget the appearance of mork was this really the 1950's ironically films produced during the 1950's such as rebel without a cause and the wild one have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays br br unfortunately the tv show happy days is not in the same league as rebel without a cause or american for that matter happy days may have captured some aspects of the 1950's with its burger diner juke boxes cool cars and tacky plaid shirts but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal american had something to say about young americans in the 1950's whereas happy days seemed more about what middle aged people of the 1970's wished the 1950's had been like the result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950's happy days is at best a comedy fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950's as its backdrop as pointed out by another reviewer the all american kid richie cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop out like fonzie and mel would probably forbid fonzie from entering his diner br br a quick history happy days was originally a pilot called love in the happy days that was rejected for broadcast comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show love american style which was often aired in place of baseball games that had out or other unexpected programming and or alterations in short love american style was a throw away show that contained all these one episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut love in the happy days did appear as a love american style show sometime in the early 1970's but at the time tv executives could not foresee how a show about 1950's young people would be popular particularly during the hey day of comedy shows centering around middle aged people such as the mary tyler moore show and its subsequent spin offs such rhoda the bob newhart show and all in the family how things have changed since now most tv sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle aged people like the plague br br subsequently one of the young stars of love in the happy days a child actor from the andy griffith show named ron howard got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called american directed by the relatively unknown george lucas whose previous thx 1138 had bombed miserably at the box office even when it was premiered to movie executives again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950's could become popular because it didn't fit with what had been popular in the past although they didn't realize that much of the movie going audience had been young in the 1950's as everyone knows the movie was a huge hit and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience somewhere during the theatrical run of american tv executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like american they brought it back with the original cast plus henry wrinkler as the fonz re titled it happy days and the rest is tv history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970's br br happy days now seems ridiculous the characters are flat and cardboard never being more or less than what they superficially are the issues they deal with are trivial and their reactions appear mindless and even silly nowadays the character of the fonz seems to be a caricature of well the fonz was the idea to be a kind of parody of marlon brando's character in the wild one looking on the show with fresh eyes i feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950's with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks this is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time american has many of the outward appearances of happy days but it had an edge it had an honesty about the characters and their issues happy days took the look of american but failed to take its heart
