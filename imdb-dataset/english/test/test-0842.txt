<START> plot in a nutshell dave seville father figure manager of the chipmunk brothers alvin simon theodore has gone off to europe on a business trip leaving the boys at home with miss miller as their watcher much to the chagrin of alvin who wanted to go to europe while playing against his female counterpart brittany the leader of the comprised of her younger sisters jeanette the female counterpart of simon and eleanor the female counterpart of theodore in a fierce arcade game of around the world in 30 days they catch the attention of two evil foreign siblings who need to smuggle money diamonds around the world but need a way to do it that won't draw the attention of their arch enemy jamal the 2 evil siblings claudia klaus overhear the banter between alvin brittany and decide to use them as the delivery boys girls for their loot more claudia's idea than the latter initially objects feeling that it's too dangerous for children the 2 siblings make an offer to the boys girls travel via air balloons to 12 drop off points to leave dolls which resemble the kids that contain diamonds and or money to indicate their arrival with the promise that whoever wins the race will get an obscene amount of money but as the two different set of talking animal siblings make their rounds they are stalked by the henchmen of jamal but who is jamal is he friend or foe br br overall enjoyable lighthearted farce based on the 1980s tv series version of alvin the chipmunks beautiful animation is a highlight lacks the crude humor that keeps creeping into today's family films and engaging songs boys girls of rock roll being a stand out eagle eyed fans will probably notice that character design has been tweaked from the animated series giving her a less round face while adding a seemingly permanent blush to cheeks which jeanette eleanor also display br br keep an ear out for nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson
<START> one of the most boring movies i've ever had to sit through it's completely formulaic just a cookie cutout of a movie you could predict about every scene in the movie just from knowing the genre as this movie adds nothing new the dialogue is never funny interesting or intelligent the acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying basically everything looks to have been done by an amatuer filmmaker nothing fresh memorable or entertaining in this movie combined with the fact that it is long gives it an easy thumbs down sorry fans br br overall grade f
<START> i watched this film with a bunch of friends at a halloween party last night i got to say that the sarcastic comments were never ending and i have to say that they were well deserved though i felt that the directing was done well the craziness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese i think i got about an hour into this before i even started to realize what it was the point was that they were trying to drive home you catch on pretty quick that this whole family is pretty quirky and something is off about them it's just a little too slow this movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and been a lot better the only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine that i downed during the course of the flick bring on the slasher films folks because at least i know what to expect out of them this was not my thing too much dark humour and the subject material of cannibalism was a bit explicit and gross i have to say that randy quaid played the part as well as it could have been and i will give him props for that as i normally see him as a drunken goofball or a washed out fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens br br in conclusion i give this horror comedy film a very generous 3 out of 10
<START> exceptional movie that handles a theme of great proportions with a very well balanced direction was a very good director at least from what i can tell from this movie and murder my sweet but he was seriously affected by the huac as other movie directors and actors it is in a way ironic that crossfire received no oscars because it is exquisite example of how to make a great film on low budget everything about this movie is exceptional a well written script that makes use of extensive flashbacks a great cast superb lighting that seems to tell the story more than the actions proper what more can you expect from a top notch movie might i add that noir is here used for its stylishness and i might add financial advantages but this proves once more that what was originally deemed a b movie can have more impact today that most of the heavy handed a movies that lost their audience with the passage of time br br this film is not a noir movie per se and this rises serious questions about what noir actually is the style is definitely noir in terms of sets and especially lights but the theme surpasses the recipe of the noir genre you can see things from the opposite perspective and claim that anti semitism is only a pretext for the criminal investigation the puzzle around the murder being the actual focus this would have been the case had it not been for robert ryan in an outstanding performance either way the movie has a lot to offer and it is truly a pity that the director had to suffer so much iniquity for his former beliefs in a really noir period of america
<START> this movie made my face hurt i don't understand it things just happened inexplicably and they usually resulted in someone bursting into a song and dance number i don't understand how people can laud this film with praise there are b movies and then there are b musicals and then there is br br the songs made me want to run headlong into a wall the only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a musical video which eases the pain yet still fails to justify why it needed to exist the most frightening section of the film is toni creep dance that accompanies her weird song but on the bright side she can manages to find the notes that she is looking for unlike pop music sensations aka and mona wow can we say tone deaf so if you want to question life for about 90 minutes see this film if you hate your life then buy it
<START> every year there's one can't miss much anticipated red hot big budget title with the right combination of star director and subject matter that fails miserably at the box office this year it was superman returns in 1982 it was blade runner in 1957 it was billy wilder's the spirit of st louis a film that had everything top director huge star best selling true story about an american hero except enough of an audience to cover its costs maybe the public still remembered lucky lindy's anti semitism and his loud admiration for nazi germany's achievements before the war neither covered in the film which ends with his arrival in paris before the legend got too tarnished maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just going to be one guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours certainly wilder and co writer wendell are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of relatively uneventful flight alternating between a well executed flashback structure to key points in his life and the build up to the flight itself once the film is airborne it's both surprising and suspenseful finding genuine drama in his attempts to stay awake and to navigate without proper instruments br br it also builds up a quite remarkable sense of dread that's unlike anything else in wilder's filmography allied to a real sense of the epic shots like the ominous storm clouds over the hanger the dark dawn before the flight carry a real chill of foreboding to them even the typically muted and problematic warnercolor adds to the film rather than detracts from it along with the superb use of cinemascope there's a remarkable score from franz waxman majestic soaring but filled with understated menace and cleverly used as part of the fabric of the film rather than mere musical accompaniment the film does lose points for implying though never actually saying outright that this was a race to be the first to fly the atlantic in fact lindbergh was the third man to fly across the atlantic after almost completely forgotten brits and brown's astonishing flight eight years earlier but it's still a remarkably tense and engrossing adventure story that deserved the success it never found
<START> i'm a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes into this remake i started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasn't the motive for the murders was incredibly stupid two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister excuse me while i barf the main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesn't make sense considering the situation he's in if the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character dexter played by dennis quaid found he's about to die and that he's accused of a crime there is a reason for where the sex scene is at early in the movie dexter isn't living life to the fullest so he's not interested in sleeping with meg ryan i still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been lovers br br one of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet nobody at the carnival notices also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on if you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits i would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but i don't want to put a spoiler in my post
<START> i caught a screening of this at the true false documentary film festival in columbia missouri and i was pretty disappointed i was expecting a cool documentary into the protest and activism surrounding the but what i got was a largely flawed bad acted fictitious conspiracy ridden badly woven tale i'd heard of its neo documentary technique blending both true and false but i expected more along the lines of a fictitious storyline developed for a better personification and to create a sense of unity between real interviews but it was more along the lines of a terrible made for conspiracy theory tv movie br br the acting overall is terrible except for which is not surprising considering the director at the screening said most of the lead characters had no acting training his excuse being that he wanted them to be real heres a hint real people can't act but actors can usually act real br br it would of been not so cornily offensive if it wasn't blatantly obvious about how keen he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory onto us throughout the whole movie its especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director cameos and starts ranting on about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas the movie also does a good job of laughably stereotyping every single role it tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and stamp a big 'good' or 'evil' on every character br br skip it maybe find yourself a nice real documentary
<START> i must confess i was surprised at how good this movie was when i first watched it i had planned to see it in theaters during the summer but found out unpleasantly that it had already been and gone therefore i expected it to have been removed from theaters because it was bad then today i rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it the speed that events were occurring was questionable it could have been a little longer i found it was very true to the book however it left out some crucial parts mullet real name etc i felt as if i hadn't read the book i wouldn't have really understand what was going on the acting was quite good another thing i had expected to be poor however the cop sorry i can't remember the actor's name could have done a little better all in all i found this to be a very entertaining movie and would recommend it to all audiences
<START> a mexican outlaw tomas steals gold from a stagecoach along with some other mexicans and americans the americans double cross the mexicans and leave them all for dead the one outlaw survives and looks for revenge in this film that has jack all to do with the original django the distributors only named it django kill to squeeze a few more bucks out of more gullible people what we have here is a slightly below standard western that's too surreal to be that enjoyable and as such i can't really recommend it to all but the most hardcore western fan br br my grade d br br blue underground dvd extras part of spaghetti western collection uncut django tell 20 minute documentary poster stills gallery talent bios for tomas theatrical trailer br br 3 easter eggs highlight the hidden gun on the extras page for trailers for django run man run and a man called blade highlight the hand on the main menu to get interviews on the formation of a rock group and a hidden gun in the language subtitles menu leads to the story of how tomas almost got killed for being anti communist
<START> yes i am a fan but how many people who watch this movie are not going to be and so i'm reviewing this movie from a fan perspective and with no regret i would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who has not played the game br br visuals 10 10 i loved advent children it's a sensory delight a complete audio video overload the visuals were breathtaking some feats were accomplished that i would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature when the action scenes came about they were for lack of a more accurate word a roller coaster with dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range to seamlessly integrated bullet time effects at the crucial moments to the sheer level of detail it's all hard to fault the animation looks big budget the style and imagery is awesome and the effects at times made me forget that i was watching animation rather than live action footage i could ramble on for hours repeating myself on the fantastic quality of the visuals but it simply wouldn't do it any justice br br sound 10 10 the sound was fabulous the voices for all the characters didn't disappoint no one sounded silly and the sound effects were bold and sharp the music from the game that in my opinion had the best game soundtrack ever transfered beautifully to the movie most of the memorable themes from the game are present in the movie albeit often using different instruments to fit in better with what's going on there was some bolder rock and slight thrash metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time but it all fitted in well with the movie's situation at the corresponding time br br story 7 10 the story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie both aspects were simply not up to par with the game but then again the game could spend 40 hours developing these points the movie only has about 90 minutes as far as the story goes the plot wasn't bad or anything but just not as ambitious as was expected from someone who played the game through in effect the plot seemed rather weak in comparison the game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and story progression development that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league instead the movie took the more sensible approach to expand on the action and try to place as many inside jokes and themes into itself instead of trying to impossibly recreate the massive story factor which was originally such a driving force in the game the lack of usage also caused me some controversy the story of the movie chose to use little though not zero and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill i would hope that if a sequel was made it would incorporate much much more extravagantly and importantly into the film there were also many plot holes in the movie all which can be forgiven if you think of advent children as a random anime but seem ridiculous when you realise how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well br br characters 7 10 the characters whilst all being present in one form or another don't necessarily shine to their true potential there simply isn't really enough movie time to spend with all of them and so all of their background stories and abilities are not entirely showcased and in some cases barely at all red and cait sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions even cloud who is the focal point of the movie i feel doesn't use enough of his familiar abilities from the game the issue is a strong reason for this with that said it's a joy to see the cast back in action even if it's in such a role that doesn't utilise them to their fullest the new characters were the ones that caused me most of the strife however the bad guy trio and the kid dude denzel there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and be done with it but objectively speaking the issue is still there to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing br br value 10 10 the replay value for this movie is excellent i personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and louder way bigger screen louder volume br br enjoyment 10 10 whatever the flaws of the movie they simply weren't big enough to hinder my enjoyment of it and i honestly think that will be the same case for most people i enjoyed advent children tremendously and encourage fellow fans to go see it
<START> great adaptation of the christie novel surprising attention to authentic period details for the time many films of the mid 1970s early 80s that try to do 1920s early 30s look far too mid 70s early 80s for my liking so expected the worst here and was gladly proved wrong the costumes and sets are very well done i liked this production very much Â largely due to the adorable francesca annis' portrayal of a carefree bright young lady frankie and james charming bobbie the pair would go on to portray christie's tommy which is funny as some contemporary book critics compared frankie and bobby to her earlier characters of tommy the supporting characters were equally well done Â the over the top mrs acted by miss marple to be joan h and badger is played perfectly as the post wwi bertie wooster type
<START> the problem with the film is quite simply this conrad's prose is powerfully verbose and cannot be adapted to a movie marlow's narration in the novella captivates you from the first sentence and you only see what conrad writes about in movie it's different you see the visual but the description and reflection that really makes the novel is frightfully missing but as far as an unadaptable book has been adapted it is of good standard there are the exact same scenes which are quite but they never have the same affect as in the novel the plot in the movie has been enhanced and it works very well to make it more interesting the references to ancient egypt were thoughtfully inserted my tip read the book and keep it that way there are better movies out there
<START> i really enjoyed this film it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat it was very well directed i think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as terry and and show them as people with emotions as this film needed to show bobby as a cold and vindictive person br br i agree with another review it was sick love not true love he didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby he should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together some reviews say that she was naive i think she was when it came to the adoption however best actors all round great movie to watch
<START> to remake lost horizon as a musical the need for a rodgers hammerstein or lerner lowe type musical composition was needed burt bacharach and hal david were the wrong choice having said that my favorite thing about lost horizon is its score it's just that the score doesn't fit the piece the cast is made up of mostly non musical talents ullman finch and hussey were all dubbed and still don't sound all that great br br frankly the novella on which this and the earlier non musical film versions were based is mediocre at best while the possibilities for a truly good cinematic musical version exist they are not realized here the film succeeds at being a good rainy day vehicle to pass the time otherwise you are better off buying the cd of its soundtrack only recommended as a curiosity piece due to the film's awful reputation i've seen much better but i've seen much worse
