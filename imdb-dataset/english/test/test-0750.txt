<START> the debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured if limited stab at the con game and obsession filmed for zero money nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of london to ply his trade given the lack of funds this short 67 min is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom though the initial set up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept the muddy cinematography he often used natural lighting due to budget can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization though the limitations do show at times br br one can easily see nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in memento and insomnia not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans
<START> what a drawn out painful experience br br that's over two hours of my life i will never get back br br this film festival director's delight is awash with overuse of the long slow shot however that's not the only thing that makes a script br br avoid this movie at all costs
<START> first let me say i'm not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies i love movies for example is also a favorite but this the positive points can be summed up easily the photography is splendid and the music is perfect does it make a good movie i used to think so but this one is a perfect example of one that for me doesn't make it maybe it's because i'm too dumb possible but i don't think so for example also used very long shots but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking and i mean just their heads because in this movie there are a lot of those shots but sometimes it is effective the general result is plainly boring even with the intelligent undertones which are done in a way that while intelligent is above all very pedantic br br you also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic or symbolic effect but just to spare on budget br br i'm very disappointed in this film because i really liked the first 30 minutes or so but it just went on and on without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes br br while reading the very praising comments on this page i also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to it when a movie is slow and arty it doesn't necessarily mean it is very profound yes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town which is quite interesting on itself but it does not make a profound movie except for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it but then it's not what you find in the movie but what you find in yourself an exercise that in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching stalker or solyaris than harmonies that owes much to but cab never equal it's level
<START> awful br br despite the good performance of ed harris diane kruger and the strong budget the reason for the 3 stars the movie is by far the worst i saw about a composer and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music i agree with some fictional stuff to upgrade a biography that otherwise couldn't be so charming this was done in amadeus with best results but this b copy here is a flaw beethoven had a strong personality but was a sensible artist here in this movie however he looks much more as mike tyson i wonder also whether despite his deafness he heard all the in the last scenes may be a implant i prefer to listen to the ninth on a cd with some nice maestro today most of them conduct modern wagnerian orchestras by the way i gave amadeus 10 10
<START> the united states built the atomic bomb in order to show their superior military power and to end the second world war the movie fat man and little boy is a portrayal of the efforts of american physicists to invent the technology necessary to create the bomb and the tension that existed between the scientists and the military over the potential uses of the bomb and even the of its creation the scientists thought that the bomb should be created as a deterrent a mechanism that would halt the war by wasting as little life as possible fist they saw themselves as in a race with german scientists who were attempting to build nuclear weapons themselves when the germans were defeated many scientists hoped to stop work on the bomb project as they knew that the japanese did not have the technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon and therefore did not pose a threat of massive loss of life those who favored the continuation of the manhattan project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration inviting the japanese head of state to view its deployment upon some tiny deserted island this massive display of force they felt would be enough to win the war no killing would be needed the us military under the direction of general leslie hoped all along to used the bomb as a actual weapon to be deployed against the enemy first against the germans and then against the japanese because of the persistence of japanese soldiers on the small japanese islands the us decided to drop the bomb on populous cities in order to end the war first hiroshima and then nagasaki the display of that vast amount of force also served notice to the rest of the world that the us was the dominant military power a message aimed especially at russia whose growing military power and economic weight in eurasia threatened our preeminent world position fat man and little boy was a movie that had good intentions in mind but muddled them rather badly by the choice of actors script and cinematography one of the main points of the movie was the struggle between the military view of science for killing and the scientific view of science for knowledge the keystone of this conflict is the continued disagreements between general and dr oppenheimer mr newman does his job in the part of the general craggy massively angry and radiating his dependence upon the success of the project dwight schultz on the other hand never puts up much resistance at all to the general's demands always looking rather weak deflated and phlegmatic in his audiences john cusack presents a stunningly unsympathetic character in as flat a role as i have ever seen it looks like he is just reading his lines laura dern seems to be suffering from the same none of the characters are helped by the script which is almost childishly ridiculous in the way it attempts to explain scientific concepts offers the most unrealistic stock relationship between mr cusack and ms dern imaginable doesn't even give us the cheap thrill of watching the army drop nuclear bombs on japan and relies heavily on voice over a technique that is evil anytime even when explaining a characters true innermost thoughts or for the narration of something that cannot be possibly show on the film medium but is used here to read some absolutely trite selections out of cusack's diary the cinematographer offers us several shots of the ominous shadow of the two bombs which might be striking if it didn't look like they were cardboard cutouts instead of bombs the fake atomic fire really does look fake and why use it when the stock footage on hand is so genuinely stunning and realistic and the pervasive brown tone doesn't seem to be thematically appropriate besides that it's not a bad movie
<START> why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down it is cute and funny exactly what it is meant to be madonna wasn't out to prove herself as an oscar artist with this movie anyhow she was just doing what the character called for and she did it well i loved her in this movie it is my second favorite madonna movie after evita the soundtrack is excellent too it is no better or no worse than any cheesy 80's flick to all the critics just don't take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it madonna is a goddess
<START> if you just watched all dogs go to heaven and learn that there's a sequel don't watch it it's horrible it's absolutely awful they rush the characters to develop sasha for example begins singing about how you can count her out for love and at the end this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy adventure film they rip charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy soft but still rebellious version of himself br br the humor behind carface's character is just completely lost he's a totally different dog he doesn't have a cool voice anymore he isn't that villain you love to hate anymore he's just a wimp voiced by none other than mermaid man from spongebob speaking of voice actors br br charlie has a completely different voice and while it isn't horrible i don't like it it's terrible in comparison to the excellent job that burt reynolds did for the character in the first film dom deluise is wonderful as always as itchy that character stays true and that's why this film gets a 3 10 purely because dom deluise was still voicing itchy br br oh and my last complaint i know ann marie's movie was done and gone she has parents now etc but did charlie completely forget about her or what no mention at all of her in the second film i mean even a small mention from itchy would have been acceptable ex charlie we have to get back you can't take care of every kid that needs rescuing or something of the sort i mean he died living with her she deserves some kind of mention br br don't watch this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel
<START> i taped the morrison murders on lifetime movie network and i watched the morrison murders on lifetime lifetime movie network and on courttv jonathan and john corbett did a great job of playing luke and walker morrison i am glad that walker got his brother luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother bobby i enjoy watching true stories on lifetime lifetime movie network and on courttv the morrison murders is a good movie to watch next time the morrison murders is on lifetime lifetime or courttv i am going to watch the murders again because my favorite actor john is in the morrison murders i give the morrison murders a ten because it is a good movie about walker who tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother bobby and at the end walker discovers it was his brother luke who murdered his parents and his brother bobby
<START> i was pulled into this movie early on much to my surprise because i hadn't intended to watch it at all now i wish i hadn't the suspense starts out well with the hit and run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess or be found out or doable now though a no no in the old days of movie making get away with it the plot's been done before what plot hasn't but the tensions inherent in it with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair make for an absorbing first half then the film abandons the hit and run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited all suffering loves the two tracks of plot hit and run and unreasoning love just don't have enough to do with each other and that they involve the same characters doesn't bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line the screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other at the end of the film in the midst of the movie's second funeral i found myself thinking now what does any of this have to do with that hit and run the filmmakers may think the answer obvious but i think the movie was plotted and executed
<START> i don't think this cartoon was as bad as some may think of course i was only five at the time it came out but i did find it very entertaining at the time and would still give it a look today if given the opportunity batman and robin being voiced by adam west and burt ward was a nice touch and gave it a sense of familiarity for me as i was also watching re runs of the campy 1960's live action show batman at that age this cartoon also introduced some new twists i had forgotten all about like bat mite for instance looking back on it i'm sure he was likely as annoying as many think but he didn't bother me much at the time the best i can recall his voice sounded like a cross between dumb donald and gee i wonder why anyway give it a look if you can and make up your own mind you might be surprised
<START> typically a movie can have factors like arousing good feel sense of purpose plot etc there's always something that can be taken out of movies its just a matter of how compelling the reason is for me to own it in my collection of two sisters as they call it when it was released in my country has tremendous feel and an eventually mostly self explaining plot i love horror movies that revolve around a house titles that come to mind are the others the haunting the haunting of hell house this movie will be a another great example that i will remember the movie had extremely rich colour in the way the house was decorated in the clothes that the characters wore in the open daylight scenes that is in contrast to most horror movies which typically makes use of desaturated tones and gloomy environs think mizu no soko kara dark water which is another show i like that gives this film a sense of aesthetics and joy when it wasn't in its more gripping moments the characters are extremely believable this may be partly attributed to the familiar setting of this movie maybe domestic issues are easier for both myself as well as the actors to identify with and the actors become their characters with exceptional finesse the director toys with timelines in order to give the audience the story in bits and pieces allowing them to come to their own terms of interpretation instead of presenting everything in a linear fashion this is a positive aspect of this film in my opinion and perhaps it is my interpretation of this movie that allows me to find it enjoyable i would definitely look out for this on dvd
<START> with no dead heroes you get stupid lines like that as this woefully abysmal action flick needs to be seen to be believed william sanders is saved by his buddy harry during an extraction in vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy fast forward ten years and harry is now a brainwashed russian operative with a mind control implanted in his brain his new russian superior is ivan played to the obscene hilt by nick nicholson who might i add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in kentucky with his stained teeth what is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialog coach for this film soon william is re recruited by the cia to hunt harry down he teams up with barbara a freedom fighter who has infiltrated el salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of south america some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following one such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by william and barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate background music i've ever heard who would strip completely nude in the middle of a south american jungle there is a rape scene that uses the end theme from blood on satan's claw as well no dead heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills in one scene harry his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys i had to rewind it and count hard to find film that has recently gotten the full hd treatment by mgm track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues
<START> this is a horrific re make of the french movie ma vie en rose http imdb com title the only scenario that i can imagine in which anyone sinise bates butler what were they thinking agreed to be associated with it is maclaine seeing the original being rightly impressed and enlisting a friend with no writing credits or talent to his name to translate the themes for american audiences whom they both agreed are stupid stupid stupid then she enlisted other friends to sign up and they did so as friends certainly not on the merits of this pathetically contrived everything but the kitchen sink script br br i'm not a knee jerk fan of french film but ma vie en rose is a subtle thoughtful and thought provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues i would love to see it get wider exposure among english speaking audiences and if that means an american re make so be it but puh leeze a little respect for the issues and the intelligence of the audience and better direction for the actors who couldn't seem to decide if they were working for tennessee williams or jerry lewis
<START> this movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war everything about the movie was perfect i just saw the movie yesterday and i want to get my own dvd asap and watch it many times over the story ends as it started i was very happy that he came back and i was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream she honored her father boyfriend husband and her lover the character had many shades christian bale is also an phenomenal actor some stories do have happy endings aside from the love story angle i thought about how a beautiful serene and peaceful island had been affected by war and it made me realize the true devastation war can have on its people government makes the decision whereas the people suffer her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams i loved the scene where she is complaining about not getting a dowry and i also loved the scene where both lived through the earthquake they were survivors
