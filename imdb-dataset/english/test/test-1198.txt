<START> i rented this movie for two reasons the first was all of the good things that i read about it i definately was impressed and couldn't agree more with all of the reviews i read the second reason is because i know these guys i don't know mark as well as i do mike he hasn't changed much from the years we knew each other i know him as the reaper from a local milwaukee radio station the way he is in this film is genuinely mike 100 he once gave me a table that he made it was a little one about 15 high that said metallica on it the odd thing about it was it only had two legs sometimes it's the thought that counts and mike always has thought about others first
<START> rita hayworth as rusty parker is the cover girl du jour she's one of the dancing girls in danny mcguire's club the most special one according to danny gene kelly and pretty much anyone who comes across her take for example vanity magazine magnate john otto kruger enchanted by resemblance to her grandmother also played by hayworth in flashbacks whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and he doesn't believe that danny could give rusty happiness or everything she should be entitled to he even gets danny believing this himself when rusty shoots to fame as girl' danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of noel wheaton lee bowman so what happens when danny returns to town with his sidekick genius phil silvers in tow only to discover that rusty is marrying wheaton br br as a musical cover girl benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by jerome kern and ira gershwin including the oscar nominated 'long ago and far away' possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully sweetly sung as a duet by hayworth and kelly number thing' the more lacklustre john' isn't a kern gershwin collaboration and 'put me to the the dancing of course is top notch since gene kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography it shows in the simplest of dances for example his dance with hayworth to 'put me to the or the joyfully exuberant 'make way for tomorrow' number performed by the trio of danny rusty and genius which foreshadows the reaction gene's character has to the police cop in the title number in singin' in the rain kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the ego' dance like its successors in anchors aweigh and an american in paris jerry the mouse and the 16 minute ballet respectively this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity kelly brought to the modern film musical wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn't be showcased on a stage and years before cgi kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style himself the number is hardly five minutes long but it and kelly's genius still takes one's breath away even sixty years down the line this is the reason i watched cover girl and if nothing else this dance is truly worth it br br you can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto cover girl and rita hayworth not that she doesn't deserve it witness the scene when rusty hits broadway the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for entrance hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of kelly very few of kelly's co stars have that honour she is hilarious in some scenes for example her drunk scene when john and wheaton come to get her from joe's br br for some reason however her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help cover girl overcome its general curse of mediocrity that curse is only lifted whenever gene kelly is on the screen dancing or no or when eve arden as john's long suffering secretary by with another cutting comment or clever observation since the film in the end belongs to hayworth neither kelly nor arden can save it as a whole this isn't to say that the film is bad it isn't it's enjoyable with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at but it's just not quite a classic the dancing is classic though so watch cover girl for that and you won't regret it
<START> this film moved me at age 39 in the same way that all the footage and coverage of dogtown affected me when i was 13 for all of those who criticized the self promotion of the z boys interviewed they have the last laugh on you that was their whole deal we're better than all of you and here's why insert footage of the smoothest pool carve imaginable this was a film to tell their story and that was their story whether you like it or not it was their opinion of their skating that mattered not yours or mine i thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as i remembered it in the 70's the reality is that they did revolutionize skateboarding they were the impetus behind extreme sports and they did inject a cultural paradigm that reached into every corner of americana this movie gave rebirth to images of on a wave and and jay adams ripping up the coping that was the california dream to an entire culture of young american teenagers that just wanted to have fun and get rad as i watched this film i realized that it was these images that i lived with every day until i was old enough to move out and back down to so cal after my family had moved to nor cal when i was five until i could get back my buddies and i built and thrashed ramp after ramp searched for every empty pool possible and mimicked everything covered about these guys we are all educated and have family's and careers now but this film reminds me who i was at that age and why i still surf this is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture extreme sports the 70's or even just good documentary film making will enjoy completely whenever it comes on cable i can't change the channel kudos to stacy peralta for making a beautiful piece of art
<START> enjoyable film that gives you romance women on the verge psychodrama work place sexual harassment adultery and fashion it's all there typical characters found in corporate america joan crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys hope lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body their personal lives is the subplot br br wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell stephen boyd's hairstylist that a little dab will do ya the amount of in stephen boyd's hair is distracting at times his character's relationship with lange's character was never fully developed which i found disappointing overall the movie is enjoyable br br rating 8 10
<START> i am almost tempted to demand my money back from the video store this movie plumbs the depths of inanity and is almost completely unwatchable i never bail out of a film early but this was painful to view a thorough waste of celluloid my vote 1 10 it would have been zero
<START> okay when i bought this flick i though this gotta be the ultimate b movie space monkey landing to the earth and starts right away to kill people br br well it was almost everything what i expected typical low budget scifi movie from the 60's acting has to be the worst i've ever seen especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off br br so why 'night doesn't fall in to category 'so bad that it's good' reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring for example the scene were the police officers are searching clues in the woods it was just minutes of walking without purpose and then the grand finale the people's waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears it get in 20 second end of film br br yeah 'night is boring but it got couple of funny moments i can recommend this movie to all who liked films like the thing from venus' or of the swamp br br i give 'night 4 space monkey slaps out of 10 br br rob gruesome
<START> i absolutely like this film a lot it is not very entertaining but it's a feast of bizarre and stunning images there's no dialog only some background sounds and noises if you are into something completely different and original and enjoy the obscure and bizarre then you might like this work of art looks like a film made with the very first camera ever made in a time where strange human like beings live and perform their bizarre habits god has killed himself with a razor and gave birth to mother earth mother earth impregnated herself with god's semen after an act of fellatio and gives birth to a son flesh on bone what follows are inhuman acts of ritualistic torture rape and murder for purposes we do not know or do we
<START> this movie just stunk i know that some people will say that anybody who thinks it is no good just doesn't get it i like wenders in american friend and wings of desire but this is utter dreck the main character is so annoying that i couldn't care less what he does he is as has been said in another review bouncing around like a little annoying monkey i just couldn't stand him or force myself to care this is the case with most of the characters who just seem to be trying to hard to be or weird i liked the mel gibson character and the milla jovovich characters and wish they would have focused more on them milla is of course beautiful pitiful and you really feel for her and what she has been thru and why she is the way she is i see gibsons character as almost frankenstien like i just wish he would have save milla and brunt the hotel down with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it milla rating 10 movie rating 0
<START> i saw this movie late at night on a free to air channel and i must say i was pleasantly surprised being a horror movie fan i often watch these sort of midnight movies during the school holidays more often than not the horror movies shown during this time are usually big certainly does not fit into that category br br campfire tales is basically an anthology of short stories based loosely on well known urban legends they are pieced together with a setting involving teenagers telling these stories around a campfire this campfire setting has a mysterious plot in itself however this particular story is weak and confusing obviously used predominantly to set up the other spooky tales br br there are three tales in this movie four if you count 'the at the beginning all of which are truly spooky and well made i especially enjoyed the third tale 'the involving a guy whose motorbike breaks down in front of a mysterious household this particular story works well in really freaking you out with sudden flashbacks of the house's history in addition to this the ending of the tale will completely shock you the first tale 'the was also very creepy though the second tale 'people can lick too' was somewhat lacking br br being a horror movie veteran i don't usually get freaked out this film certainly did that job well what i particularly liked about this movie is the fact that it's split up into three shorts this means the movie won't plod through an hour or so of character development and setting establishment before the real bloodshed begins that makes perfect for sleepovers parties etc br br campfire tales is a creepy crisp horror movie that will make your heart stop more than once it's certainly better than the crap you'll often find in the cinemas these days blair witch 2 urban legends final cut bleah find a copy and watch it if you dare br br
<START> screenwriters peter viertel joan harrison and of all people dorothy parker enable director alfred hitchcock to expound on what may have been his favorite movie theme innocent man wrongly fingered for crime takes it on the lam hitchcock who some credit with originating the story engineers a great deal of suspense in plot about a warehouse worker blamed for the explosion which killed his best friend he sets out on journey to find the real culprit plenty of excitement on a grand scale with usually colorless actors priscilla lane norman lloyd alan baxter doing surprisingly fine work even eternally smug robert cummings gets into the proper spirit from
<START> this movie came very close to being a good flick the direction needs to be a bit smoother to progress from one piece to the next to make it more plausible in particular the main character's need to escape is not explicit enough is he trying to kill himself is he trying to escape his life does not seem to be that bad so it makes it more difficult to swallow that he wants to leave his life so much also it is not very clear how much in love he has fallen with jennifer jason l if the movie was reworked with some more attention to these details it would have been great on the other hand for an indy flick it's pretty good maybe if you have a couple of drinks to dull the logical thinking it would be more fun br br
<START> steven seagal played in many action movies most of them were bad but not bad as the patriot this one is a z series action low budget movie after operation delta force act of war the substitute 2 plato's run the base drive sabotage etc comes the patriot now steven seagal is sure to be considered as a bad actor like mark dacascos jean claude van damme treat williams jack scalia gary busey chuck norris michael madsen and many others the scenario was full of holes and the characters were not realistic maybe because of the very bad actors and the 4 25 bucks you spend by renting the patriot are called lost money i give it a half for laughs out of 5
<START> i couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because i found this movie a total drag childish humor cheap looking sets cheap looking effects a plot that makes legally blonde look like the usual suspects and so many coincidences that i can now officially say that robert rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996 the only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves but there's where it ends ok so the guy decided to do something new for a change a children's spy movie well if i were 12 i'd feel insulted the best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing carla that just stole every scene she was in sadly there weren't many 4 10
<START> i had the pleasure of watching this two chairs down from one of the executive producer at the atlantic film festival which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of us br br filmed in atlantic canada the movie is about three teen aged girls who in one of their last summers of their youth devote a large deal of energy to sleeping with a married 30 year old man despite much br br it's definitely worth a watch but the humour was geared a completely different demographic than the one i inhabit male 18 25 so i was shaking my head at the character's antics rather than laughing inspite of this the story is strong enough to hold up for itself make it entertaining without so much laughing
<START> eugene o'neill is acclaimed by some as america's leading playwright but for things like the iceman long day's journey into night the emperor jones strange interlude was a piece of experimentation he concocted where the characters on stage look aside to the audience and say what they really are thinking and then resume conversation it was a nine hour production with a dinner break on broadway so you can safely assume a lot has been sacrificed here br br for the screen the voice over regarding the thoughts is used for all the characters it probably is a technique better suited to the screen sir laurence olivier did very well with it in his version of hamlet but bill shakespeare gave olivier a lot better story than o'neill gave his players in this instance br br players like clark gable norma shearer ralph morgan may robson etc are a lot more animated in most of their films than they are in strange interlude the story takes place over a 20 year period norma shearer is a young woman whose intended is killed in world war i she starts playing around quite a bit although that part is not shown in this version she makes the acquaintance of alexander kirkland and his friend clark gable she also has as a perennial suitor ralph morgan a friend of her father's henry b walthall br br she marries kirkland but then is warned by his mother may robson and shown that insanity gallops in that family to quote another literary work since kirkland wants kids and shearer and robson think kirkland's train will slip the track if he doesn't get one gable is recruited for breeding purposes of course you can see all the complications this can cause and o'neill explores them all br br gable is so terribly miscast in an o'neill production but he was an up and coming player at mgm and did what they told him shearer does what she can to lift a very dreary story but she seems defeated at the start best in the film is possibly robson who puts some real bite in her dialog br br strange interlude ran for showings on broadway in 1928 1929 and starred glenn anders and lynn in the gable and shearer parts perhaps no one could really have saved the film because two years earlier groucho marx lampooned the out of it in animal crackers after seeing what he did i don't think the movie going public took it too seriously br br and since it's not the best of o'neill neither could i
