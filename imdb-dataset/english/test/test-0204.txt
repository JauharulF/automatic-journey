<START> if you are thinking of going to see this film then my advice is dont br br for me the film failed to make the grade at every level and was a reminder of how dire most british irish films are forgettable tripe is the best i can say if it had been on telly l would have wandered off to do something more interesting five minutes after the start i saw this film with a group of friends and having read the press previews went along prepared to not be critical and hopefully pass an amusing 90 minutes but oh dear br br as a comedy it wasn't funny as a thriller the stupid story was sloppy and lazy as a love story totally unbelievable most of all as a piece of over the top it lacked both style and charm and caine did what they needed to do to earn their money playing er and caine is it just me but other than playing east end gangsters and jack the lads does michael caine leave you cold br br in fairness some of my friends thought it was 'ok' but if you do go my advice is have a few drinks or puffs beforehand and leave your critical faculties safely locked up at home br br
<START> there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas so let's get that part out of the way first of all let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film cat was well just awful br br jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian and fearlessly commits to over the top outrageous characters mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks br br why why why mike myers the kids could care less and the austin powers demographic isn't going to spy this film so what was the studio thinking br br the cat was also apparently related to linda richmond can we talk why a new york accent not entirely consistent with anything dr seuss has ever written myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish shtick i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said as long as you don't say fahklempt' you can keep the accents meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort either with the costume make up or dialogue br br the jokes what few there were were crude and age inappropriate when myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera dirty ho everything but the rim shot was missing and even that wouldn't have helped br br the same folks who created 'whoville' clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'cat' the sets and props were very appealing giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing direction and myers br br there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston dakota fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr seuss classic and stayed true to the genre br br call the spca this cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again please please no sequel
<START> ida lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy robert ryan in beware my lovely a 1952 film from rko lupino and ryan did three films together and worked well as a team both being consummate professionals and strong performers in this film based on a broadway play called the man lupino is a world war i widow who rents out a room in her home she's very active and well liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years she's not ready to move on the man who rents her room goes on vacation and lupino hires robert ryan to help her with some heavy duty cleaning in the house he's friendly enough to start but later terrorizes her locking her in the house and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door as he grows violent and more out of touch with reality br br the character played by ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house he's working in it isn't clear whether or not he's the killer since he seems surprised to see the body he might be a split personality as when his personality turns ugly toward lupino he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it he doesn't know that he has the keys to lupino's house in his pocket and doesn't know why he has tickets to a party that he bought from young children who came to the door br br beware my lovely is a very suspenseful film and the two leads give terrific performances the tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way you're not expecting
<START> large corporations vs conscientious do good ers we seem to witness events both real life and reel life of this sort all the time and most of the time greed wins by employing every means dirty necessary and the truth gets suppressed at least in this movie jack jack lemmon got his points across and paid for it dearly we have seen several more movies of this sort being made in the recent years the most memorable of which was 'the where russell crowe played a tobacco industry scientist who tried to blow the whistle claiming that the industry added more nicotine in cigarettes to make smokers addicted there was also this reporter protagonist angle where the reporter is looking for the scoop of his her dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma where he she has to choose between righteousness and his livelihood and sometimes his her life br br jane fonda played reporter kimberly wells to perfection she plays a reporter who wishes to pursue serious news whereas her bosses value her more as an 'eye candy' she and her crew the cameraman played by post michael douglas who is also the producer of the movie witness an accident in a nuclear power plant while they were on a visit cameraman michael douglas sneakily illegally gets footage of that event on tape in spite being a no photography zone and smuggles it out of the station the station refuses to air it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station br br in the mean time the chief engineer jack launches an investigation of his own and discovers a lot of irregularities in the equipment that's being used for the reactor this starts all the dirty politics of corruption and greed br br this is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of tension in the audience till the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score to suggest all the scary moments now that's great and unusual in movies performances were all good and i love jack lemmon we primarily know him for his comedic roles but he is equally good in dramatic roles i give this movie an 8 10
<START> rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains more or less is a rather short which is a good thing in this case escapade that focuses on the mysterious hellraiser box who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it we're introduced to 3 generations of the merchant family all played by bruce ramsey one in 18th century paris one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far far opinions on this storyline may differ a you think it's very idiotic and far fetched and dared the initial atmosphere and setting by clive barker has completely vanished yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling hellraiser bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of pinhead doug bradley still is an extra horror value pinhead Â accompanied by a pet puppy this time Â still knows how to bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly best aspects in this production are the newly introduced and the occult parisian portrait giant turn offs are the weak script the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to barker's initial masterpiece br br although not highly memorable itself bloodline stands as the last watchable hellraiser film after this sequel the series went downhill completely so far 2 more sequels came out 2 more are still in process and neither of those is worth seeing hellraiser bloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as alan he doesn't want to be remembered as the director of it who could blame him
<START> this is a romantic albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites it is one of the many classics of the 80's genre like pretty in pink or some kind of wonderful br br nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley preppy girl julie it is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end br br true most of the acting sucks but br br i have been in love with nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since he's really grown as an actor but it is obvious in this early movie of his that he had a lot of potential br br if you love 80's movies you will love this classic br br go rent it
<START> for those of you who don't remember movies http www imdb com title this came out in '79 i guess enough time has gone by so naturally figured he could just redo this and say he wrote it yea right br br the acting in this is way overboard the tough guys walk around with their shoulders hunched forward to give the impression they are bigger than they really are also the hero' seems to have a passion for snorting and rolling his eyes in a bug eyed kind of way to express angst anger to the celluloid eye br br there is a sort of racial message here from the sicilian perspective mind you this is about 3rd generation down the line the original arrived in oz after the war and during my childhood yep i'm an aussie so the has been diluted a lot they even sound like true blue aussies not a flicker of the accent anywhere there there's another slang for ya nun br br with sunnies sunglasses at 4am must be cool to be sun blinded in the middle of the night and it looks like this is at this movie's tedious end tried to copy the flavor of the warriors but left too many holes in the story how about coincidences br br the warriors had a gang of baseball guys wielding bats with white face makeup chase the heroes to a train station and fight them gang get chased on a railway station by a gang of stick wielding guys wearing whitish face masks the warriors were mistakenly accused of shooting murdering another gang member gang are mistakenly accused of raping the sister of the big gang boss the warriors are lured into a room by a gang of girls who attack them crowd want to crash at a friends house which is populated by yep a gang of girls there are almost too many copies from the warriors to keep on about here br br i am saddened that people don't want to see other moves from oz because of this tripe how about mad max commander and master of the world not all movies are made by actors who are so bad they have to fund their own movies br br as far as the other actors in this show are concerned they seem to have taken their cue from the nun as they all are as bad as each other don't bother with this movie i can't get my money back so save yours
<START> stunning blonde natasha henstridge is the young not so grieving widow in the mansion on the hill telling her story to a tv reporter in virginia and among the community's well heeled horsey set she's suspected of involvement in the death of her older husband that's james brolin trusting as a babe in arms flashback made in canada based on an article that appeared in vanity fair magazine it must be true whatever it's far more romance than mystery and a very familiar tale leggy species star henstridge as a gold digging hospice nurse it could happen i guess and it's good to see brolin in a sizeable role after his turn in antwone fisher even if he doesn't make it to the end of the picture the end of the picture he doesn't even make it to the beginning of the picture which is why flashbacks were invented of course
<START> rise of the undead starts as some huge nuclear type blast rips through an unnamed american city a few people survive in a building by leaning on the door so it'll stay closed keep the nastiness out they argue amongst themselves for ages then a monster thing arrives from seemingly nowhere begins to kill them of one by one br br written produced directed by jason horton shannon one has to say rise of the undead is terrible the script takes itself very seriously but makes little sense the first thing i asked myself was if there's this huge nuclear blast type thing going on outside destroying the entire city why are these people i'm watching still alive why is the building they are in still standing then i asked myself when was something actually going to happen the entire first 20 minutes is set in one room actually that's a bit generous it's more of a corridor as the main character's argue then it turns into some return of the living dead 1985 rip off with a government created virus which turns people into zombies before one of the most abrupt pointless seemingly random plot twists i've ever witnessed which renders most of what has just happened a complete waste of time then for the final 30 odd minutes rise of the undead turns into some strange sci fi type thing as something which resembles a ball of energy floats around killing everyone was i the only asking what this floating ball of energy thing is where it came from getting back to what was happening outside what was the reason again oh that's right we are never told rise of the undead is a mess the character's are awful aren't even given names the twist about halfway through will have you tearing your hair out in frustration the dialogue sucks nothing is explained there's virtually no story here the final 10 minutes maybe a bit more of rise of the undead features no dialogue whatsoever the film just suddenly ends br br director's horton were obviously working on a low budget the entire film is set in about two rooms three corridors the photography is awful they use annoying colour filters seemingly at random sometimes it really does look like rise of the undead was shot on a camcorder there's no special effects there's some fake blood splashed around but no actual make up effects to speak of there are some cgi shots of the city being engulfed in flames which look alright but the floating ball of energy creature thing looks terrible there is one baffling shot early on where two people are sitting against a corridor wall talking for some bizarre reason their heads are cut off at the top of the screen just their lower bodies from the neck down are seen yet nothing else is happening in frame they are not moving there's no else there but for some strange reason their heads are cut off the top of the frame as they talk to each other it's quite an odd thing to watch actually br br with an ultra low budget of about 10 000 according to the imdb shot in two weeks i have to congratulate the makers for getting rise of the undead finished distributed but that's where my congratulations stop because otherwise this has awful production values is set in about three corridors which are located somewhere in new orleans in louisiana as that's where rise of the undead was shot the acting sucks so i won't dwell on it br br rise of the undead sucks it sounds like a zombie film but in all honestly it isn't everything about it is sub par i know the filmmakers were working on a low budget but that's not really an excuse as far as i'm concerned definitely not recommended
<START> this is one the worst movie i've seen and certainly worst movie has made i can't believe person who has created movie like teen can create utter crap like this br br plot of the film itself is really faulty that zeenat has to search meera and get her to help her husband avoid death penalty in arabia common logic says if zeenat cannot search meera easily so won't the government so zeenat can safely forge signature or thumb print and produce it before the another silliest thing is shankar has given incorrect address in his passport so indian government officials cannot get to the address but after sometime meera gets suitcase through government wow doesn't it make well networked in india more than indians br br makes a slightly more than cameo in the movie with role of chopra who is eyeing meera and seeks father in law girish this guy is just wasted 's help to get her as a keep br br cannot speak hindi and he has been assisted by other guys to translates the english dialogs he writes in hindi this time it seems that his aide was in serious intoxication when writing dialogs like ki leap of honesty within minutes to our worst nightmares meera not only takes this honest leap she taps her feet to do ka dance of honesty br br one of the only bright spot movie has is its cinematography and really nice hues but since bollywood has learned the thing called post production almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely blended backdrops so no big deal br br conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to chopras or johars or barjatyas and all are ready to get affected
<START> cute idea to have dionne warwick do the song vocals for this movie adaptation of jacqueline bestselling book a la valley of the dolls although it's really too bad this sudser doesn't have patty duke's o'hara to spike the story the love machine is unrelievedly dull even the final brawl with an academy award as a fight prop can't save it dyan cannon seems embalmed in her heavy pancake make up and cumbersome fall although her tiny figure is a beauty to behold john phillip law is a block of wood in the lead david hemmings embarrassing in gay mode as a flamboyant photographer and where is robin stone walking to at the end is he trekking out to the waterfront to pick up some sailors after cannon has deflated his masculinity it would be a safe bet in that case love machine the final episode might've been a more interesting flick certainly better than this yawn inducing snooze opera 1 2 from
<START> typically elaborately crafted hbo production with a first rate cast a rich small town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes graced by above average production values br br but and that's a huge the various subplots peopled with some likable mostly annoying caricatures are paper thin and go and and on in dull stretches for over three long hours br br the often silly story veers uneasily between melodrama without being entertaining enough and personal drama without being profound at all br br a shame because some scenes really shine two or three that is br br 4 out of 10 grubby paul
<START> think of this film as fan service a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer we start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins the virginal mandy lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size so you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night who want to do nothing but have sex do drugs and drink booze the only other company is a hunky ranch hand who may or may not be suffering from gulf war syndrome hmm potential future suspect maybe br br so as you're probably by now all the house guests end up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways and for a change the black man isn't the first to die there are some conventions that still hold up though like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem even down to the so called shocking twist at the end the movie is like an old 80's horror updated for the noughties and on this score it succeeds br br unfortunately it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too namely the paper thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise people get cut up shot bludgeoned etc but because of their innate hatefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations it's hard to care as the bodies stack up someone gets murdered one of their friends goes out to look for them alone bang they're brown bread rinse then repeat maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible intelligent likable characters who make rational decisions but still end up being outwitted by a genius killer until then we have to tolerate teenagers with the i q of pond life being picked off by a deranged hoodie oh well 4 10
<START> i have to say that some of the other reviews of this film i have read show very little understanding of it or the original tv series it stemmed from dad's army was a sitcom and therefore had humour and so is bound to have put a smile on the face of the dire situation however the series carried very many serious messages such as the episode about the bigotry and ignorance that was attached to conscientious objectors the film was faithful to the series and was simply like an extended episode so i'm afraid the reviewer who claimed that columbia improved the humour was quite wrong and let's face it the bbc sitcoms of this period beat anything that came out of america hands down also comments referring to propaganda were also way off the mark the were people considered unfit for frontline service who still wished to serve they were very brave men who knew they were sentenced to death as soon as they signed up as hitler announced that anyone who did so would be executed if and when britain was invaded thank you for allowing me the opportunity to set the record straight as it is always good to actually speak and comment on what has been seen rather making it up as you go along i find
<START> i sell the dead revolves around convicted grave robber arthur blake blake's friend and fellow grave robber willie has just been executed and blake is going to follow suit the next morning while he sits in his cell awaiting his execution a priest named father duffy comes in and asks him if he will tell all he has seen as a grave robber he then proceeds to give father duffy a quasi biography of his more interesting exploits br br the plot pretty much consists of several incidents only tied together by chronology this prevents the viewer from ever getting bored but it also makes the events less significant as you could easily add or remove a lot of scenes without noticing it much though flawed i thought overall this method added to the fun loving nature of the film and kept it very entertaining most of the various stories are good specifically the alien the murphy's and the vampire but others weren't so great br br the acting isn't amazing but i didn't find it bad at any point dominic monaghan had a good performance as he managed to be serious when it mattered and also play very well into the comedic parts of the film br br the characters were not extremely in depth but they were all interesting i also enjoyed how a number of the villains were done in a over the top almost comic book manner the part with the back story of the murphy's and their gang is priceless br br so overall i sell the dead very successfully combines horror comedy and sci fi into a mish mash of fun and excitement it is one of the more interesting and original movies i have seen in a while and it's unfortunate that independent films like this don't get more recognition
