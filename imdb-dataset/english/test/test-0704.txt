<START> i'm sorry to say this but i didn't enjoy this movie at all it was just too boring so boring that i couldn't watch the rest of it it's not as interesting as the lion king or aladdin that's why i hate this stupid days because these days are just not what they used to be the movies that disney have released lately really sucks i miss the old days when they used to produce good movies like the lion king aladdin pocahontas cinderella the aristocats and robin hood this movie is really awful i really tried my best to be interested in this movie but i just couldn't i don't think i could recommend this film to anyone i would recommend the ones that i just mention above
<START> rendition is a film not to miss with solid writing from kelley sane and with the direction of gavin hood that takes us on a story which is a ride through a man's journey through hell once again meryl streep in a convincing role of the cia today and great performances from a cast of superlative actors in reese witherspoon jake and alan arkin along with actors of middle eastern descent who add to the reality of the story br br in rendition you see how terrorism can breed terrorism and as the film progresses tying the story to what is playing out in the middle east is reality brought to the screen the external shots add to the intensity of the story and peter sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an assistant in the ass kissing way of how american politics are conducted too bad there has not been a larger audience for this film as along with the valley of and lions for lambs rendition plays an important role in showing an audience how the fight for and the protection of democracy can go seriously astray
<START> i thought this movie was absolutely hilarious i already knew it was going to be a funny movie but it was funnier than i expected sure there were some lame jokes but they cracked me up i thought the actors were going to turn out to be pretty bad but the actors were good in acting out this comedy i have to give kudos to amanda bynes she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled off an awesome performance as a boy as for the other actors they were funny as well of course there were moments where you yell at the screen how can you not tell but that's all part of the fun in the end the plot turned out pretty well there's a happy ending but you expect br br overall just hilarious
<START> definitely not only for urban legend aficionados campfire tales is an often scary and always fun ride through several popular stories it is also a film that exceeded the low expectations i had a horror film i had never heard or read about a straight to video release granted the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise but with horror films nowadays it can be all or nothing a cast of mostly unknowns well i'll leave the math to you br br the film proves to be an entertaining suspenseful and overall very enjoyable experience the four stories are well paced and satisfying the only one i felt was a little weaker was the for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the characters' actions however i still loved the tale its atmosphere and ending my favorite one was the third story people can lick too the suspense in it is not only palpable but also educational br br i found campfire tales to be one of those horror gems one discovers by chance and then goes on recommending it to everyone br br 7 10
<START> the story is shortly about the faith lacking business man priest daniel clemens christian slater who is looking closer on a case where another priest is suspected for murder the priest denies he's guilty but at the same time he is not able to discuss the matter due to confidentiality enter daniel clemens who starts playing cop br br while the plot isn't ridiculous everything else is let's start with the visual side the cinematography is dull it looks more like a tv series than a movie the camera angles are boring in fact there's not a single memorable camera angle in the entire movie there's no interesting closeups revealing details and the scene transitions well there's not much to say about those they aren't smooth at all there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the actual plot okay they did use a transition with music in between two scenes but there are no interesting visual transitions in the entire movie the times dissolve was used there was no visual connection between the scenes br br the boring visual part could be forgiven if the film would offer anything else unfortunately the film only offers forced wooden acting and clumsy dialogue with no punch on top of that the film suffers from audio problems the sound volume is lowered several times in the movie as if the microphones would be too far br br i didn't predict the solution of the film it could be because the film never gave me the opportunity or it could be due to the presentation which was so boring i never even tried to figure it out br br put two plus two together and it equals a b movie where 'b' stands for boring
<START> gary cooper and a marshal change identities since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the outlaws what is remarkable in this film are the costumes both the and steve who is the bad guy cochran wears his guns backwards probably to be able to the film starts quite excitingly with a showdown with wild bill hickok ruth roman looking very pretty is the fiancee there is plenty of action never a dull moment but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated good entertainment
<START> this movie is an all time favorite of mine i'm sorry that imdb is not more positive about it i hope that doesn't keep those who have not experienced it from watching it br br i've always loved this movie i watch it about once a year and am always pleased anew with the film and especially the stellar performances by entire cast br br i've always wondered whether jean stapleton actually did the ending dance with travolta if anyone knows this piece of trivia please leave a comment br br thanks and enjoy
<START> this is probably the only movie i have ever not been able to make it all the way through not only was it annoying and boring but the low production values made it hard to make out the action and in some cases the dialogue avoid this one like the plague
<START> this was the most uninteresting horror flick i have seen to date the premise is glaringly forgotten after about 1 minute the acting is terrible the scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss yuck what were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a 'best film' the only reasons i didn't turn this movie off were to see what not to do as a filmmaker and if the paper thin plot line could really keep going on as is was i was not disappointed by this latter notion there wasn't even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the kiddies interested also i thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of resident evil 2 in the movie was that supposed to be filler 'cause it was the goriest and most interesting part of the movie
<START> after the death of all senior officers commander craig scott of the laundry and morale corps finds himself promoted to command of an intergalactic spaceship owned by corporation its chief mission is to search for planets and of course long term coffee markets br br craig scott and his second in command chief blather find themselves ill prepared for command except insofar as they are fully able to keep the crew's undies clean which is not to diminish the importance of clean undies especially when incompetent commanders cause those same undies to be well soiled on a regular basis br br the episodes are presented as a series of short 2 3 minutes reports by the commander to earth the humor is a mix of wry deadpan and outrageous physical comedy think yes minister meets red dwarf but on a shoe string budget all the usual plot devices of sci fi are here aliens nuclear weapons computer malfunctions but each is improved by the fresh lemony scent of high grade laundry br br log is definitely low budget but the somewhat cheesy effects and props fit the absurd premise of the show remember those hilarious hockey helmets they wore on the old battlestar galactica with the brand name still visible okay there's a lot of that in log but it's cute br br log ain't high art but that's not what it's trying to be it's just a little bit of off kilter fun it does a good job of being that
<START> this is marvelous movie about a soul of ale this is a journey to heart i found it fascinating the director did a great job he makes the scenes talk especially on the silent scenes the window of ale is a great one an the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes i have seen br br apart from directing it has been a quite time i did not watch a movie about a soul as a philosopher i can say that this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul so as soul br br as living in turkey i do not care about the other side of ny this is a universal scene you can see everywhere in the world as to my opinion more universal than every other thing br br do not miss this film otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul if you have one br br
<START> i just watched the dvd of this award winning film one life stand is a stark drama that through it's pace black and white shots and atmospheric music paints a very compelling and honest picture it's a story about life's dilemma's around power sex and control highlighted by a few sad lonely lives the mother very well acted by maureen carr is uptight and drawn in on herself the father only appears on the side lines and yet is a powerful and pivotal part of the drama money is hidden in boxes and shoes br br the writing was superb and i liked the sensual close up shots of details such as nails red lips a candle mirrors etc the way the camera was used made it very intimate it's a harrowing tale with sexual undertones while the glasgow on the dark streets adds to the despair of the sad characters br br there are some highly memorable shots conveyed simply by a walk or a dropped shoulder such as walking away under the bridge and the stunned and hurt look on face in the call centre which hopes to helps people through using tarot cards as she listens to a caller talk of her own abuse br br at the start we see john paul wide eyed and innocent having photos shot as he wants to try modelling his mother is deluded and making poor choices for him in a way pushing him away while she tries to keep him john paul's modelling turns into escort work and boss offers her money and eventually they go on a date there are also moments of humour and subtle irony one excellent scene is when they are having a fairly normal meal and starting to open up a bit when the father appears with his dark presence and clouds everything over but this and other things offer moments of hope br br i felt at times the pacing of the film was a shade too intense but this is a small detail in another wise challenging and memorable film and something a bit different it stands in start contrast to most american films which are either total fantasy or the real' world' as seen through tainted glasses this film depicts life with all its rough edges and displays unforgettable images br br this isn't entertainment' but a thought provoking and real life drama br br one life stand is a truly involving and emotionally honest film
<START> seems like m is back the man behind la comes back with a really fun and clever sequel to those old fashioned oss 117 whereas directors tend to over actualize sequels of old classics remember the avengers chose to work on a really cheap hero oss 117 a kind of low budget french 007 and decides to do it in a old school way the photography the body attitudes the fights choreography and the fx everything is like an homage to the way films were made back in the 50s and it works as the tone and jokes of the movie are really good jean embodies perfectly this stupid arrogant macho selfish french spy lost in a country he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority yes that's it just the way the occident uses to consider its colonies back then and oh no i won't say it has anything to do with what happens nowadays in the very same area ah ah he just looks like an unfrozen lino ventura with something like 40 pounds less which is perfect for the role the other members of the cast fit perfectly as well with all you can dream of russian spies egyptian and former nazis and of course the women as there has to be femmes fatales in any good spy movies the plot is good maybe not brilliant but really good enough taking place between actual historical facts and remembering us in a funny way how france and the others treated its colonies back in those days it all starts in 1955 with a british spy disappearing while tracking a russian cargo full of weapons in then france sends his best friend agent oss 117 to discover what happened to both the shipment and the agent the fact is that this agent is really as dumb as can be and he slips through the story without even understanding it solving it in a very clouseau esquire way i have to say i had a bad feeling about the movie as the publicity made around it was quite frightening and as french humor tends to be quite populist and flat forget about les 3 or camping but i was really surprised and in the good way i highly recommend it whether you want a good parody of bond esquire movies much more fun than in d e b s for example but less skirts or you're a fan of that genuine and candid way of filming they had back in the yes that's it clever and really funny you've got the point once again mr
<START> although i found the acting excellent and the cinematography beautiful i was extremely disappointed with the adaptation br br one of the significant portions of the novella is the fact that ethan and mattie decide to kill themselves rather than go on this is never presented in the movie they show it as if it were a sledding accident br br the character changes in mattie and are almost non existent while in the novella they almost change places at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both invalids br br lastly that mattie and ethan consummate their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and poignancy of the finale br br the change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change br br neeson and arquette are superb in their portrayals joan allen was also wonderful however her character was much watered down from novella br br i do not expect films to faithfully portray novels but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story br br overall i would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed
<START> this is possibly one of the worst movies i have had the dis pleasure of watching in my entire life the plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people i watched this film with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end ben kingsley's character is just plain stupid but not funny at all it is a wonder why an actor of his talent would be involved in such tripe tea leoni does a fine hillary clinton impression throughout to portray the very cold and uninteresting female lead who has all the endearing qualities of a broom handle throw in a pointless and unexplained sub plot and a horribly cringe worthy montage and you end up with a waste of 93 minutes 60 in my case avoid this film at all costs
