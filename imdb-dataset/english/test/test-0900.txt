<START> what a shocker for starters i couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying the jerky camera movements were also annoying the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot and then there's the ending i'm still not really sure what to make of it i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid br br the case had a couple of those little award winner nominations symbols on it so i figured it couldn't be too bad i was wrong if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
<START> what i find remarkable about this terrific film is that altman the crazy and wild guy that he is took the novel that cold day in the park and the sandy dennis character was originally a male in the book he was a mentally whacked out isolated gay who looked out of his apartment window when he spotted the hustler it is strange that altman fans aren't aware of how clever he was to change the sex of the main character thereby avoiding the homo erotic taboos of gay life in the 60's and actually making dennis' reclusive kind of madness work even better in the transposition if you see the film again it will be evident how wily the altman mind works
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen yes i know i'm not the target audience target audience is females either college age or middle aged or any aged i guess i'm none of these so the makers don't mind if i don't like it but that won't excuse the fact that the dialogue and the plot are horrible the main character phoebe goes on a journey to europe to find out what happened to her sister faith who committed suicide phoebe is an inane character that i hope no one identifies with faith is also a character with very little believability wolf is the only person who seems to be somewhat reasonable as i said the dialogue is boring and uninteresting the plot does completely stupid things at times the absolute worst is that phoebe and faith's father is an artist but his paintings are completely dreadful there is nothing new interesting or refreshing in this movie if your a guy you will pray for the ending if your a chick you might be able to sit through it but you will be unimpressed
<START> this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything that's holding it back br br awesome talent outstanding performances particularly by victoria hill but a let down in practically every other way br br an adaptation of sorts it brought nothing new to macbeth no setting it in present day australia is not enough and essentially completely failed to justify its existence apart from let's face it completely unnecessarily paying homage to the original work if there's one body of work that has been done and done and done and done it's shakespeare's so any adaptation if it's not to be a self indulgent and pointless exercise needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work br br and that's what this macbeth fails to do as it was done this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever it's the same piece that we have seen countless too many times before except with guns and in different outfits br br apart from the fundamental blunder no other way to put it of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue one of the more moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end during which i completely tuned out even though i was looking at the screen i never thought i had a short attention span but there you go br br i suppose the movie succeeds on its own very limited terms but as australia continues to produce world class acting talent its movie makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with br br a shame an absolute shame
<START> on top of the fact that is a complete douche bag and his cons are unimaginative his schemes require way to much preparation to make any of his scams worth while without giving away any spoilers as if it matters with this piece of crap his cons are such a sham because it takes the effort of days and days of planning and the use of multiple accomplices and an entire camera crew etc just to scam someone into a service that would cost less than a hundred bucks in addition if you read in the credits they re stage some of the phone calls etc because they don't pan out the whole concept of this show is bunk because all of his cons have the cost in both the crew and the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service he is trying to get for free what is the con
<START> while i agree completely with below about mary mccormack flopping a milk bag out on tv the rest of the show is fantastic phil hartman was great in a way teaching the celebs the ins and outs foley's a nut but in a good way you never know what self humor he's going to come up with next as for the game play it's entertaining filled with witty banter and great for any newbie that may have even a passing an interest in the game too bad it isn't on anymore i just checked the schedule all the way to august and it doesn't appear to be scheduled for any time in the future bad bravo you deserve a beating
<START> yikes and we all thought joan crawford was the horror mommy dearest well laura hope as mom in this stinging 4 character film delivers and cops the goods in this cracker of a marital mommy mangle the silver cord is a genuinely sensational pre code drama from rko made in 1932 released in from a 1929 play so astonishing frank and honest is each startling verbal exchange between one son's wife along with the other's fiancÃ© as these two younger girls together go to war gleefully angrily unwrapping the clearly incestuous of mom towards her hunky eldest son played by virile joel and her younger son payed by delicate and beautiful 25 year old actor eric linden i would think this film played to many howling appreciative audiences in huge theaters in 1933 and offers viewers even in 2005 a very fruity melodrama enlivened by crackling dialog not afraid to call mother exactly as she is this film would have been impossible to make after the censorship code came in after 1934 other viewer comments on the imdb support my reaction and you will find almost everyone lucky enough to see and tape the silver cord will agree it is an unforgettable and pungent script in a superbly produced film it would have played like the virginia wolf of 1932 laura hope must have kissed the sound stage at rko for this role of a lifetime even more than her fluffy turn in gwtw irene dunne is as gorgeous and casual and believable as ever fighting for her husband yet again and it is well worth seeing the divorcÃ©e made in 1929 as a companion piece to the silver cord joel is certainly in the same league as cary grant and randolph scott in the handsome and lovable stakes i had never seen eric linden in a real acting role before he played the leg amputee in the hospital horror scene in gwtw and here he is startling and youthful with an excellent role as robert the younger and more sensitive son some verbal barbs leveled at him again would not get past the code office if made later this is a really good film and if the viewer forgives some of the of its time and settles in for a sparring match of unequaled pungency for a 1932 movie you will be well rewarded at first i thought some of the throat clutching melodrama of mother was dated until i realized it was a set up of the excellent screenplay to make the viewer laugh at her as though she is a weak little old lady not but nor are the other two women in this powerhouse play on film hence the fantastic retort dialog that ocean liner seen in reel one is the leviathan the monster ship the us won from the germans in ww1 that was so huge and unwieldy that crews were nervous wrecks trying to wrestle with it upon the atlantic it is infamous for ploughing headfirst up a colossal wave in a storm and shot over the crest at such an angle the spine along the bottom cracked and the ship split vertically between the it limped to port with rattling steel panels and winking rivet holes and mentally shattered crew and passengers it was scuttled in 1935 after being cursed and plagued with horror mechanical problems all its existence not such a war prize after all br br anyway the dialog in the silver cord is enough excitement for one night eg mother the doctor said there was nothing wrong with you in fact he said it would take a stick of dynamite to kill you
<START> there is little more that i would like to say about this movie than it really can touch your heart if you let it sure it's surrounded by all the stereotypical hollywood stuff but i found myself actually engrossed in this movie and very interested in the outcome i'd recommend it to all you romantics out there in a second
<START> this movie was astonishing how good it was the plot is extraordinary and the acting spectacular at first i thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that i was dead wrong i literally cried about four or five times in this movie and despite this i must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week no the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been but the plot is what really gets you american or i would recommend this to anyone and i have now i guarantee that after seeing this one you'll get the best out of it and its plot i hope you feel the same and write a rave review too
<START> i could have liked this if i didn't like diane arbus br br didn't really capture arbus unique visual aesthetic as stanley kubrick did in the shinning with the twin girls in the hallway a direct homage to one of arbus most famous photos and one with haunting qualities none of this movies images have and certainly none of her character outgoing likeness thin and jewish not wasp queen kidman or life save some very superficial similarities she was a fashion who later photographed freaks and outsiders among many things this film focused on the freak as her symbol for artistic and personal empowerment in a really shallow and predictable fashion outside of that it might have been an interesting movie about middle class fetish but i was too annoyed to care br br perhaps if arbus name had been left off this might have been less annoying but had it not had her name in the title there would have been nothing to make me interested in seeing in this in the first place a letdown from secretary
<START> ever went on youtube well the definite question to that is yes do you see the boatloads of and nickelodeon rants no definite answer br br many people think is a dull and idiotic program and others think it's the best program on the face of the earth i have seen many of the loads of reviews panning in the head and some giving it a bouquet of roses in my opinion is for the kiddies but the show is just awful br br if you did not read the last review here are reasons 1 8 1 steryotypes 2 goofed up drama 3 everything is silly taco truck for example 4 carly thinks she's nice but she's mean 5 anyone over the drinking age is stupid 6 sam is petite but strong 7 no real companies 8 mean teachers br br 9 the just look on the to understand what i mean 10 the also spills personal information 11 almost every famous thing is insulted insults the japanese race benz and man to name a few 12 there are too many jokes sam's obsession of meat freddy's computer pulling his shirt off etc 13 the video games based off the show suck 14 freddy has a lack of masculinity why it's getting unoriginal 15 the show is targeted towards a female audience i also hate shows directed to a male audiences too so i prefer to be for both genders 16 the words and no 17 the overuse of laugh tracks br br part 3 coming in early spring just in time for spring break
<START> this was one of the most dishonest meaningless and non peaceful of the films i have ever seen the representation of the other of the israelis was racist backward and unfair for one the song played on e car radio when pulled up alongside a very right wing israeli driver was i put a spell on you by natacha atlas the song's style is quite arabic but it was released on an israeli compilation cd and i have even heard it on the radio in israel many israeli songs as well as architecture foods and slang are influenced by arabic culture and there is no reason an israeli jew would be offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song the way e s appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare via a long still shot is meant to force the viewer into seeing the jew as haggard and racist and e s as noble and br br i have traveled all over israel and i have never seen an recruitment poster since service is mandatory but in the film not only is there a recruitment poster but it depicts a stereotypical image of an arab terrorist and the words want to shoot this is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of israelis as well as israeli soldiers and such an advertisement wouldn't even exist on a random israeli highway in including it the director aims to convince the audience that israel is a society of anti arab racists hell bent on murder br br the ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent a hollywood style action scene involving israeli soldiers shooting palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an israeli directed film as the ninja scene should have been but for some reason images of an unrealistic non comic and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the israeli side so much beforehand that any shot of israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome the director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges portraying the other as human or working towards peace violence is made to be the only solution this is furthered by scenes of exploding tanks falling guard towers and other random acts of destruction one of my best friends serves in the israeli military and the targets in firing ranges are never arab women dressed in black or any other quasi civilian on canvas soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger the method according to my friend is to provide a warning shout fire into the air or around the area and then if all else fails shoot in the leg and then interrogate and arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head as shown in the film is not the proper procedure br br besides these inaccuracies the directing style was also poor repetition became repetitious and no longer captivating symbols such as the balloon with drawn on it are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration in the setting the balloon is palestine penetrating and regaining jerusalem and it is created for no reason by e s the ambulance being checked for permits by israeli soldiers followed by subsequent israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint is an overly overt claim of an israeli double standard by the director the attempt by the director to show life in nazareth as dreary and pointless is done with overkill showing the routines of random people over and over again even with a slight change each time and emphasizing that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes the dreariness of life without allowing much room for personal interpretation by contrasting one section of the movie daily life in nazareth with the second section the checkpoint between and israel the director subtly blames this dreariness on israel but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly argued br br i spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly and why many modern fashion show like and metal action tracks were included in the score i still cannot come up with an answer i felt that the music was out of place in this film the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thought provoking i can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes but i found that there was nothing comic to be found in israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja or a woman having to suffer another walk through a checkpoint albeit defiantly in fact i was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes whatever the director's intent it provided only an displeasure throughout the film br br this film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other and neglects to actually address any issues it is a propaganda film because the director intends various symbols styles and scenes to draw sympathy for the palestinian side while displaying the israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception the vibrant atmosphere of an action packed hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by palestinians against israelis such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side there is no thought reflection or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience emotions are simply pulled to one side and kept there in a good vs bad clichÃ© scenario i believe this film lacked the depth quality and power of other palestinian films such as paradise now and wedding in the galilee
<START> my husband dragged me to this film as i had no interest in seeing some anime cartoon i was absolutely delighted by the simple story and amazing animation in a digital world where effects are computer generated it was refreshing to see gorgeous imaginative hand drawn animation the world of and is a vivid fantasyland intermixed with minimal reality i haven't seen animation like this since i was a child and it is wonderful to see it endure and succeed br br the actors supplying the voices in the english version were fabulous the length of the movie was perfect especially for children who tend to get squirrelly in films overall a delightful experience worth the very expensive ticket prices we have nowadays
<START> tempo di time to kill by is a bit of a strange film but it's good in it's own way br br i won't bother with a summary of the plot most that i've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those didn't really understand the film and you need to understand it to some level even if you cannot describe for yourself what it's actually about this film is strange in a once upon a time in america way only shorter br br many 'hollywood' stars whatever that may mean have played in lesser known italian productions it's known that many actors who are past their prime or slowly rising to it do this cage was not yet a real star when this was made i'm not a fan of him he's very good in some roles raising arizona bringing out the dead and weak when he plays the hero i don't really know what to think of him in this one but he sure doesn't portray the typical hero main character this film could have done without him but the fact that he starred may be the only reason this one ever made it to dvd br br the supporting cast is good not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there solid support br br i have seen 3 films by marco polo sacco and this one and i think he is one of the greater directors of this time unfortunately nobody knows him this movie was his last in a long time a break of 19 years i think that this movie might have failed at the office but from the way it is done i think that for it was a personal project that he really liked br br the production is great it's always enough the dusty army camps the cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part it all feels very real in some scenes you can almost feel the heat the sound itself is nothing special but the music by ennio morricone is very good it's not a piece that you will whistle when in the shower but it sure works great br br so this movie looks feels and sounds just right it doesn't serve the lessons learned from it on a golden platter but that may be the biggest difference between hollywood and euro cinema all around it might sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people but that is what i do if you are looking for action avoid this one if you are looking for a well made apocalypse now in a different time and setting but with a bit of similar journey into a 'state of mind' sorry if this sound corny but i don't know what else to call it you just might enjoy this one a lot
<START> i agree with most of mr rivera's comments and i just want to ad a couple of caveats this film the mascot is criminally neglected in its current form for that matter so is vampyr the mascot isn't a bonus feature it's tacked on as a chapter in vampyr even though it's made very clear that this is a separate movie it should have been treated as such by the manufacturers and while i m at it vampyr needs some of that same respect and cleaning up as well i got the feeling the decision to put the mascot on there went something like this br br dude a we just transferred vampyr to dvd but it comes up about 20 minutes short we need to put something on there that won't cost much money can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films dude b not to worry i have this little animation thingy that's been sitting in my drawer just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter dude a you're awesome dude b the animation's of the mascot is great and there's no need for me to repeat what mr rivera's done so well however this thing needs some major cleaning and restoring especially the audio the plot comes through in the dialogue and in my copy there were so many hisses pops and places where the sound just dropped right off i would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box no amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable it just brought up the and made the hisses and pops louder br br bottom line is starewicz's films need to be put into a respectful collection cleaned up up liner notes and the whole nine yards in other words they need to be 9 out of 10 for the movie not the product which would get only a 5
