<START> this is a classic that will be able to hold up with drama's to come simply because of the fact that it is shot with a 70's style and it's a story about the 70's it is funny action filled entertaining and sad at the same time it has the effect to pull you into the lives of these poor folks and the consequences for their actions 4 stars
<START> it is a shame that a movie with such a good cinematography as this one had no plot to be supported by the work of sarah cawley cinematography and adam film editing and above all no sense of what goes on in mexico city the movie tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in city but it is unable to do it it is a shame a lot of film wasted an american woman tries to find her brother who has been the first account of the story is powerful and interesting very realistic but it seems that there was no effort to come with a better narrative of the ordeal especially when it comes to the issue of the attitudes of the us embassy personnel in mexico city when dealing with an issue like this one compare as an example with frantic 1988 which deals with a similar issue something similar can be said of the role of local authorities compare as an example with todo el poder 1999 the movie is worth watching if you want to get a sense of the looks of the city itself paying little or no attention to the rather weak plot and the many twists that require a rather extensive suspension of disbelief who is going to believe that a mexican patrol from mexico city is going to go all the way to catch the main characters to the mexico us border and that this policeman is going to be able to use its radio from the border to mexico city only the producers of this movie it is worth mentioning that unlike frida and other movies about mexico at least in these one mexicans talk spanish
<START> i saw the short titled the reader recently and found that the movie was well planned and executed i really felt for both characters that morgan and elizabeth franz portray in this film elizabeth was able to show great range with her blind character and left me feeling emotionally connected morgan was able to sell to me that she was totally committed in keeping sissy or franz protected from the grief of losing her sister who had been living in copenhagen the great thing about the film was in the short running time and budget of only ten thousand dollars duncan rodgers was able to make a very well made film that kept the interest of the viewer rodgers has a great insight into the actor's ability and transition great camera angles to showcase their talent i always feel if a director can make a great film with a small budget then what can he or she do with a much larger one great job duncan
<START> this film may have been the first puppet master but this sure bored me to death when i saw this stupid movie i wanted a refund this was a bad series to the puppet master and i'm sure that i am not the only one that thinks this was terrible to some it was great but to others it was a ticket to ville and boy are they right the puppets didn't even do anything nor did they kill people it should't be seen by people so i'm warning you not to see it you will be disappointed even to the fans who love puppet master it was a waste of their time and it didn't make so much money nobody even got kill but one or two very pointless br br 1 10
<START> spoilers spoilers here on earth 2000 1 2 out of four br br mark here on earth holds the record for a movie containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes literally every contrivance clichÃ© and familiar plot element are somewhere in here there is simply nothing unique original or fresh about it god what an agonizing motion picture to sit through i wish i saw the film during its theatrical release last year so it could have earned on my year's worst list this is the kind of movie where the story makes itself instantly obvious and goes downhill from the opening credits and worst of all takes itself seriously here on earth is clearly one of the most horrible painful movies to come down the pike in some time br br here on earth is a teen heartthrob film so it must contain some of hollywood's most prized young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as this chris klein and josh hartnett fit that vary description and take the lead roles by storm klein plays kelley an arrogant and insolent student with a wealthy father clichÃ© number one he is to graduate as the valedictorian and attend ivy league college following in the footsteps of his father stuart wilson this sets up the i don't want your life clichÃ© in which the father tries to control his son's life while the son resists rebelliously throw in deceased mother who committed suicide a while back when his father brings home another woman he brutally questions his intentions the no one can replace mom clichÃ© counts as number two br br josh hartnett plays jasper a character on the opposite side of society to kelley his family owns a local diner enter his long time love interest samantha cavanaugh leelee sobieski a waitress at the diner who covers for her sister who has no purpose whatsoever rather than controlling the following scene when jasper and kelley act like childish morons by racing their cars and oh no crashing into the diner causing it to erupt into flames conflicts between the rich and poor will count as clichÃ© number three br br the bungled car chase sets both kelley and jasper up for a contrived and plausible conflict they get in trouble with the law but because this movie feels the need to exist the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time they must work together to help rebuild the diner br br the two boys work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a nice tan samantha's eye catches kelley and romantic sparks fly jasper is jealous but wants what is best for his true love clichÃ© number four her parents annette o'toole and bruce greenwood disapprove of her little romantic triangle clichÃ© number five but she continues two timing jasper without a second thought her father also happens to be the local sheriff how surprising lets count that melodramatic nugget clichÃ© number six br br the contrived romantic feelings between kelley and samantha count as clichÃ© number seven but samantha's relationship with jasper is never defined so how can there any romantic tension if the film is going to induce involvement in samantha's choice between the two young men then we need to see both characters from both sides the movie depicts jasper as a distraction to her rightful love kelley it's clear jasper truly loves her but it is also clear she does not love him back this absolutely slaughters the romantic tension early in the story br br leelee sobieski does no harm here however her charm and kind performance do not fit a two timing character like samantha john hartnett is also right for the role of jasper but the movie gives him nothing to do except bicker with kelley chris klein gets to make a hunk name for himself here he spends much of the movie shirtless sweaty and overworked unfortunately he does not show off his acting ability maybe because he has very little the supporting cast is much more talented bruce greenwood supplies the best performance in the film but does not have near enough screen time to save anything but a few brief moments i also enjoyed the performance by stuart wilson who perfectly fits the role of a rich controlling father of high social status br br then we lean about samantha's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie another spoiler ahead what is this she has a serious incurable illness yet another contrivance into the picture approximately number eight her terminal disease brings the two competing young men together as friends well at least i think that is what the movie intended to show that the loss of one loved by two nemeses can bring both together clichÃ© number nine br br klein rehearses his valedictorian speech to demonstrate his character is more than a shallow stereotype but we have seen this so many times before i would prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental who hides actual feelings clichÃ© number um was it ten the conflicts between kelley and jasper are desperate and inane a your mom comment triggers a fist fight while they rebuild the establishment there is a retread from armageddon as samantha and kelley sprawl out in an open field horny as hell as he slowly moves his fingers around her body naming areas after us cities why not call that number eleven the movie uses alcohol as a means to increase the romantic tension an intoxicated kelley makes a fool of himself after getting in a fight with samantha's date jasper but the following day he recites desires only to dance clichÃ© number oh no i am losing count
<START> during the brief period between clint eastwood's string of spaghetti westerns and his dirty harry films he and director don siegel teamed up to make this unusual picture eastwood plays an injured union army corporal during the civil war who is taken in by a southern school for girls until he recovers from his wounds it has been a while since the young women most of which seem to be teenagers have had a man on the premises so they are reluctant to turn him in to the local rebel soldiers the resulting situations are often humorous shocking erotic or even downright grotesque as eastwood slowly regains his strength and begins to brood over the establishment br br the basic storyline almost sounds like the makings of a porno film we have a masculine male suddenly surrounded by young nubile women most of them are sexually attracted to him and he is more than willing to spread the love amongst them the material never really slips down to the level of tasteless however eastwood siegel and cinematographer bruce surtees are such skilled filmmakers that the film always retains its dignity br br eastwood's john is like no other character he has ever played is an amoral conniving and lustful charlatan he knows that most of the women even the youngest want his bod and he lets more than one of them have a shot at him often uses flattery to butter the women up then uses his rugged good looks to reel them in he is like a drunken player at a cocktail party often hitting on different women even in the same scene eventually his lustful ways cause him great agony and loss in a way you must see for yourselves this author would not dream of revealing the specific consequences of his actions but there is little doubt he has them coming br br eastwood gives a typically great performance he seems to be having a blast with the role until things turn really ugly then he turns mean and ugly geraldine page is a treat as the steely b tch who runs the school we know she wants as much as the other girls but with her checkered past shown to us in flashbacks we find out that isn't all she's after mae mercer as a slave belonging to the school gives a great performance too she obviously knows is a skunk from the beginning and she never lets his phony charm bring her guard down this is a character you will want to know more about after the film is over she seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the film br br the beguiled did poorly in its theatrical release nobody was quite sure what to make of it and some of its content no doubt raised a few eyebrows in 1971 for example in an early scene we see eastwood romantically kiss a 12 yr old girl is he just trying to keep her quiet when the rebel soldiers get close or is he really enjoying it probably both a fantasy sequence later on even shows clint getting it on with not only page but her young assistant truly some interesting goings on in this one it's a good thing eastwood became the star he did or this one might have been long forgotten br br highly recommended 9 of 10 stars br br the hound
<START> the creature yeah it and the movie it stars in hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch this for all eternity six college students shack up in a condemned hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster who must claim five victims before it returns to the shadowy world from which it came other than having major logic and coherence problems plus the fact it appears to be unfinished this disaster is terribly acted written edited by j r and directed and the make up fx are almost nonexistent it's also significantly shorter than it claims at only 80 minutes but i'm not complaining it's the worst movie i've seen from executive producer charles band's full moon productions and boy is that bad br br to note i almost didn't bother with a review but this has gotten inexplicably good reviews on here and i figured a varying opinion was in order proceed with caution
<START> best thing i can say about this porno horror film is boobies boobies boobies br br beyond that this film is made by some hindu indian guy with some background in porn films or such br br plot talk show host and girlfriend are stalked by a psychopath who is angry over the plight of the homeless and takes it out on you guessed it beautiful real estate agent ladies films like these are why the slasher films of the 80's got a rep for misogyny br br this film is not really a slasher but has the same sort of implausibilities and stereotypes the dumb ass cops the villain is an old white male and the women are busty babes br br if you like porno horror this is your movie otherwise stay away adrienne fans will get to see her sagging breasts for a second or two
<START> although its plot is taken from the history of ancient rome is not made in the style of sword and sandal epics like or that style of movie making was out of favour in the late seventies rather it more closely resembles a cross between a soft core porn movie and a video nasty at least the shortened 150 minute version does i have never seen the full 210 minute version but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page it would seem closer to a cross between a hard core porn movie and a video nasty br br as one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of there is much naked flesh to be seen and the film lovingly catalogues caligula's sexual perversions including his incestuous affair with his sister drusilla what is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes the obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence as though bob gore vidal and brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone it is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called 'gore' characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape br br the emperor caligula and his predecessor were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles so the film's concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate i do however question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in roman history both 'the fall of the roman empire' and were set during the reign of commodus an emperor quite as cruel and licentious as caligula in neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of ' 'emmanuelle' and 'the texas chainsaw massacre' and both those films are artistically far better than br br the acting in the film is not particularly bad with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden teresa ann as drusilla malcolm mcdowell makes a suitably insane caligula suitable that is in the context of this film the real caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill the great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished british actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production in the case of helen mirren the only dame of the british empire with a past as a porn star it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy but heaven alone knows what peter o'toole and john gielgud thought they were doing unlike some other famous stage actors such as laurence olivier and richard burton gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of a decent and honourable senator of the old school unfortunately in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a br br clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence whether brass and vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question the film does not however succeed upon any other level either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship even seen as erotica it is second rate 4 10
<START> what game over kasparov and the machine does best is to delve into garry psyche during the 1997 competition against deep blue you see him becoming more and more paranoid and increasingly unravelled all because in the second game deep blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived notion of chess computers kasparov thought then and still does that ibm cheated br br game over tries to seem unbiased but it is clear that the director thinks that ibm cheated however they give no real evidence to support the cheating claim only that security surrounding the computer room was because ibm really had grandmasters hidden in there overriding the computer on certain key occasions and assertion that the computer didn't play like a computer usually does at one point in game two in game two kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn leading to the eventual loss deep blue didn't take the bait and kasparov was so rattled because the computer seemed to play like a human that he didn't even see that he could have played deep blue to a draw and ended up resigning that game psyched him out so much that he was unable to recover and after playing games 3 4 and 5 to draws lost game 6 horribly br br the question of whether ibm cheated all comes down to that single move in game two where the deep blue made the move that any human would make but that had up to that point tripped up computers joel benjamin a chess grandmaster on programming team explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always got tripped up in that situation and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming deep blue so that it wouldn't make the mistake that other computers do if you believe benjamin's assertion then the case is clear ibm did not cheat unfortunately the director quickly moved on and never mentioned explanation for the rest of the movie preferring to cut between shots of the chess playing hoax of the 19th century the and shots of deep blue hinting that deep blue was really controlled by a human as well as someone who has an understanding of programming the explanation by ibm makes perfect sense if you knew what you were doing it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that if thus and so conditions are reached then do thus and so in other words tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that kasparov created in game 2 ever happened this isn't cheating it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer br br in the end it's eminently clear that the director thinks that ibm cheated and the repeated comments about stock rising 15 the day that deep blue won suggest the idea that ibm cheated to pump its stock price kasparov even compares ibm and deep blue to enron however there is plenty of outside opinion within both the chess and computer science communities that deep blue won fair and square and that kasparov lost because he simply couldn't get past his view of computers as dumb machines and got psyched out by a machine that didn't seem so dumb after all i just wish that the director had let us see the alternative opinion br br
<START> a young woman nicknamed t n t for being virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout in terms of looks to boot goes to the most lawless part of hong kong in search of her missing brother stag jackson when she learns he has been murdered she decides she will bring the killer to justice in a fashion only she can br br sounds good doesn't it well there's really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting base for a martial arts blaxploitation action thriller which is what this aims to be the leads actually prove pretty good too with jeanne bell fitting nicely into the role of t n t and stan shaw doing well as the ambitious power hungry charlie where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers up the fight scenes are totally and completely unconvincing and or sometimes so completely over the top it reaches the point of ridiculousness which doesn't at all help when the basic focus of your movie is a kung fu action heroine also the poor lighting actors sporting accents making them hard to understand the confusing camera work and the sometimes poor sound doesn't help this obvious low budget effort out either any this does deliver in one area which may delight some fans it does offer up plenty of the t in t a in fact practically every fight scene in the film is proceeded by some type of nude scene and jeanne bell actually does have one extended fight scene in which she is completely topless br br in the end this fails to be something you want to revisit because the fight scenes are so pathetically laughingly bad
<START> for those of you who have a few kind words for this film i suspect you didn't see it when it was released as parts the horror br br it was a dreadfully boring movie it missed the mark in at least three ways it wasn't good enough to be scary it wasn't bad enough to be funny although mst3k took care of that and even in 1979 the plot was unoriginal br br earlier contenders are the resurrection of zachary wheeler 1971 it's the same idea clones as spare parts the movie is entertaining and it had a fine cast another is sleeper 1973 yes the woody allen movie remember the flattened nose and clones 1973 the last two plots aren't as similar to as the first one but they predate br br they are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea although often the word clone isn't used
<START> stanley stupid tom arnold and his wife joan like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows they have two equally challenged children buster and petunia one day mr stupid notices their garbage is gone again there must be someone stealing it from the curb he goes off in roller blades after the garbage truck when he finally gets to the dump he is startled to learn not only that other folks garbage has been stolen too but that there is a secret organization meeting at the landfill he is determined to defeat the garbage of the world it seems meanwhile petunia and buster visit the police station and a chinese restaurant in search of their parents for joan comes up missing too will they bumble their way through their problems this is just a stupid stupid movie with the culprit being the terrible script the books by and marshall are hysterical and only a couple of situations from the books ends up in this film arnold is actually quite nice as mr stupid and the other cast members try very very hard to make the film work the production values are very high with the dog and cat belonging to the adding a little oomph to the film but it is all for naught as the plot is wandering and weak perhaps someday someone will take another stab at translating the very funny books to the big screen therefore if you love to laugh rent something else while you await a new production and by all means go get the books too but stay away from being stupid yourself as anyone who watches this movie to the end could hardly be called intelligent
<START> as i stated earlier this year in my review of swordfish which was scripted by this films writer director producer skip woods this is a good film it ranks very high up there in my crime flick list among lock stock two smoking barrels pulp fiction and snatch basically i think this film is for me what reservoir dogs was for many people a cult classic although i prefer to compare it with pulp fiction i mean i never liked tarantino's first effort a lot but i sure as hell liked this one as much as i like pulp fiction for it simply has everything a classic needs a great story and good actors ok the budget might be not as big as in for instance godzilla the avengers of mission to mars but it sure as hell beats the living crap out of those films and numerous others br br the story of this film is about a man named casey thomas jane who has settled down with his wife in houston unexpectedly an old friend of his comes by disrupting his life revealing his secrets and basically making his day a living hell and a bloody one too br br the film is very original and quite bloody sexually tinted so based on that first and that last quality i can assure you that if you like this film you'll also like swordfish which of course has a much bigger budget and more famous faces than this one but is just as good though not as bloody and not quite as sexually tinted i saw this film for the second time last night and i really enjoyed it again i mean all the characters and actors are good although i must give very big credits to thomas jane and who were the best actors and had the best characters in the film also i'd have to thank skip woods for being so imaginative and original brutal sexual offensive maybe but sure as heck enjoyable and a thrill ride to the end br br 8 out of 10
<START> licence fees to watch this trash and pay for it with hard earned cash humourless no hint of laughter god knows how it won a bafta br br we've now been subjected to eastenders for twenty years when oh when is the great british public going to see this awful soap for what it is crass pap this programme no more depicts reality in the east end of london than everyday life in beirut and never has done br br the eastenders i know the real ones are kind courageous hardworking and loyal and one of their greatest attributes is humour it was the eastenders who went through the worst of the london blitz and still stuck two fingers up to hitler and what do we see on our screens for five days of the week including an omnibus nothing but a bunch of moaning wailing dead from the neck up wimps who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other what a great advert for britain that is do the writers actually believe this garbage they're pumping out obviously the woolly minded section of the public does but then i've heard that apparently anyone can be brainwashed into believing anything
