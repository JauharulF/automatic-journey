<START> the use of astral projection wandering soul to exist outside of body with the result inflicting horrible death crushing the insides of victims leading to broken spine and ruptured organs on those close to the one with such ability is the threat of eternal evil providing karen black as janus with another unique character to fool around with as a woman who influences a commercial director paul sharpe winston tired of his waning marriage and dull career in actuality she's dying and needs his body her spirit potentially harmful to his wife and son his son has a special friend who talks him into things even poisoning himself at one point a detective kauffman john novak investigating the unusual homicides concerning those killed by the benevolent spirit links paul to the deaths and through him uncovers janus soon both realize that janus must be stopped or she'll simply move to another human host what paul doesn't know is that his new secretary is lover both were actually older intellectuals featured in his documentary of astral projection called wandering soul br br director george my bloody valentine certainly creates a weird atmosphere with this movie which contains a rather bizarre premise it seems that paul's boy can see the spirit moving in the shape of a blue man manipulating the kid into disorderly conduct black despite the star treatment rarely is shot close up taking advantage of her face which can produce the type of malevolent evil her character warrants instead she's shot from afar her voice dubbed and she never quite establishes herself with the proper menace which is an opportunity lost in my opinion for some reason despite the intriguing if oddball idea of astral projection causing a spirit to kill folks from within the film just never takes off the soundtrack is very ish and the lighting and sound while at times moody and effective often is quite murky the pacing is a problem also as the story mules along the cast is rather limp especially in the lead his performance erratic at best it doesn't help that there are few characters except paul's wife we could care less about and what really hurts is that paul himself isn't exactly the most lovable person in the world he can be quite difficult and moody his unfulfilled career a reason for such behavior black should've been a more prominent figure in the film yet remains mostly in the background talked about in dialogue between paul and kauffman but rarely does she get a chance to amuse us with her histrionics which is a shame
<START> is a pointless exercise go to gold coast get drunk and have sex worthwhile ambitions maybe but not highly intellectual the plot is a simple as a few sentences assigned to each character and nobody is helped by the cliches doled out here br br something that would help is the casting everybody looks too old these characters are supposedly innocents embarking out on their own in faltering steps to adulthood yet they all look way too old to be believable in the role br br
<START> the plot starts out interesting however towards the end too many die in too short a time turning the thriller mystery aspect of the story into a slaughter br br the only true highlights were adam beach and jÃ¼rgen prochnow who were once again their excellent selves nice try with an inappropriate last third though a good ending
<START> saves christmas' is comedian ernest's christmas special film in this film ernest has to find a successor to santa claus in order for christmas to continue along the way he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important of santa's i won't tell you what that is you'll just have to watch the film for yourself like most ernest films there is a lot of slapstick humor involved br br this film is probably one of ernest's best films it's funny and it has some important lessons to learn regarding friendship and family and not being afraid to show love it's not the best christmas film around but it is a good one to get you in the christmas spirit it's a little bit sad that the film is a little dated now
<START> i guess when people say this is beautifully filmed they are talking about the close ups of frogs and the cooking of meals it certainly doesn't refer to the set which seems to be composed of about 3 rooms with no outside shots at all also all of it is filmed too close up br br i got sick of the little boy who keeps farting at or pouring hot wax over ants also do vietnamese spend all their time sitting on their kind of gross looking at least the way this movie depicts it one close up of it would have been plenty not a dozen or more br br then finally comes part two a chick flick for vietnamese girls with the perfect handsome rich man who spends all day playing the piano he is cultured the pretty maid steals him like the forbidden green mango fruit deep br br except for a few nice close ups this film is a dud it is sort of a soap opera with out dialog it is cloyed how is it beautiful the set looks completely fake br br no don't make the mistake i did and rent it because someone recommended it i was expecting beautiful shots of the coastal mountains of vietnam or something when i heard it was a visual gem br br i wanted to like this movie i like foreign movies even prefer them but this movie is dumb and dull it will leave you irritated that something like this won a bunch of prizes
<START> this film proves a theory i have had for quite some time in australia as long as a film deals with the right topic it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is aussie park boyz could not possibly be any worse the acting is beyond terrible the plot is basically a poor warriors knock off and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in australia an irish gang in twenty first century sydney the last time any irish gangs were in australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers but because it's about ethnic rivalry one of four topics guaranteed to be a success in australian cinema along with struggling families minority groups and the biography of a famous australian it won multiple academy awards i've always suspected that australian critics will lap up any rubbish that deals with these issues but part of me thought or at least hoped that they had their limits this film proves otherwise so to all you australian aspiring film makers out there don't bother putting thought into your film or choosing people who can actually act or even getting your facts right just write a script about some poor family trying to make ends meet or someone of a foreign race coming to australia and having to deal with racial prejudice and stereotypes or if you want to take a leaf out of these people's book some ethnic gang fighting some other ethnic gang that isn't actually plausible in the period the film is set and your film will win five academy awards regardless of how pathetic it is
<START> blondell farrell are excellent blondell was edible this was very funny and i laughed often throughout it great dialogue and its loaded with wisecracks i could've watched it for hours tremendous fun to watch
<START> this was a truly epic production that had all the elements that one would want in a fantasy film the costuming the music the cinematography all artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience br br ted danson best know for his tv roles in cheers and becker was excellent in the role of gulliver mary steenburgen time after time cross creek performed equally well in her limited role as his wife br br other performances i really enjoyed were james fox as dr bates alfre woodard as the queen of and peter o'toole as the emperor of br br this would make an enjoyable children's film but it also would definitely appeal to adults for it's deep social commentary
<START> bridget fonda is the sexually satisfied wife of handsome hart bochner one afternoon she comes home calls him honey and quietly fixes him a drink only to find that he's sulking minutes go by while she puts up with his frowning silence suddenly he bursts into a rage accusing her of infidelity in the complete absence of any reason to do so calls her the c word slams her head against a cabinet slaps her around and winds up flinging her off the second floor balcony breaking her hand and a couple of ribs br br she wakes up in the hospital where it is revealed she is deaf although we notice that she reads lips perfectly that avoids all the awkwardness associated with an asl interpreter or having her squawk words in a of language br br all right let me just lay out the basic plot elements this beautiful and devoted handicapped woman is beaten by her husband misunderstood by her elderly mother betrayed by her sister has her bank account emptied by unknown hands almost raped by a fat man who accosts her in a bar is thought to have murdered her now missing husband and is pursued by two cops kiefer sutherland and steven weber one of whom is interested only in justice while the other seems to dislike all women and is embarrassed by their presence the end finds her standing alone at a deserted bus stop with a hand full of cash alone tearful but brave br br now a pop quiz there is only one multiple choice question this story was written by a a man or b a woman not to sound sexist one could as easily pose a scenario about a decorated military hero and trained warrior who is captured by his enemies betrayed by his organization beaten and tortured escapes to exact revenge and winds up with the woman he loves whom he thought he'd lost long ago br br the direction is functional and conventional when fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed we see from her point of view the faces of the anxious doctors and nurses looking down at her that is at the camera an echo of every scene in myriad second rate movies in which the gurney is being hurriedly wheeled down the corridor and people wearing starched white coats and festooned with hover over the camera br br hart bochner has played a number of evil people in an interesting way some of the characters are stupid die hard and some are rather more than plain rude and the sea will tell his virile handsomeness has a kind of evil tint to it it would be too easy to cast him as a hero nice intentionally bland performance by steven weber as the dumb cop maybe the best in the film br br bridget fonda is interesting too her acting range is limited but it's on full display here what makes her an object of interest is her almost stereotypical beauty she's like a high school prom queen very feminine of course she can't help it if she slithers around or moves her hands so gracefully neither can she do anything about her nose for most of its length it's perfectly normal and attractive but at its very tip there is a bump outward that follows the natural flare of her nostrils the tip of that nose is full of intrigue br br as for the movie
<START> bell witch haunting aka the haunt is an american horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period to br br this is not to be confused with bell witch the movie a movie starring betsy palmer based on the same events however i can say that i wish i had seen this other movie instead of the one i saw i enjoyed betsy chilling performance in friday the 13th as such i believe that even on a bad day she'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as the haunt br br with regard to my heading this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing it is painful to watch because it is just downright boring br br reading the positive reviews for this movie i could only identify three possibilities the first possibility these authors were involved in the production in some way the second possibility the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed the final possibility none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise br br the setting for the plot is robertson county tennessee james johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the bell witch the story is told as a series of flashbacks a series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of john bell and his family it soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all br br on the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair albeit one based on real events br br where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong and then some br br first the acting the acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board this factor does the most damage to the production undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer the voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent i almost laughed when i heard some of her lines unfortunately this voice began to become very annoying very quickly i may not have been alive in the 1800s but i find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ghost does br br second the direction the direction is haphazard and very uneven some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director nothing is done with the camera with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary the atmosphere is equally flat a vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them i'll give one example in one scene the spirit attacks someone see the scene for yourself it's almost funny almost br br third the script whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story this movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story whilst this style was also the case with british movies from the british horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works peter cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers the same cannot be said of the actors in the haunt br br finally the humour the ill guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating an obese boy is the butt of many jokes one particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet this scene should never have been included but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing br br the only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes the decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity the costumes were also well chosen br br overall the haunt is an appalling movie it is not even in the so bad it's good league it is instead just boring i advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague don't even bother seeing it for free br br i have never seen the other movie about the bell witch but it really couldn't be any worse than the haunt could it i'll give this other movie a chance if i can track it down br br in the meantime i would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting the legend of hell house the changeling ringu the grudge japanese original and one missed call japanese original are good places to start
<START> i think i watched a highly edited version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as i expected based on the other reviews that i have heard br br other than 1 being written by the same person who wrote the original emmanuelle 1974 emmanuelle 2 the lead character being a sexually free spirit and 3 being set in the exotic locale of asia laure doesn't have the same flair as its predecessor br br i just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that i'm really not that interested in i e the voyeuristic open relationship between laure and nick i'm just happy with whatever brings her pleasure something along those lines i cannot relate to this mentality and the film characters don't really shed any light br br the second half about finding the mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film one that i didn't care for by that time i was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interest br br maybe i just didn't get it br br i'll leave it at that
<START> i caught this a few times on tv in the late 1970s it only played late at night past midnight br br peter lorre plays a kind happy man whose face is disfigured in a fire he is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and filled with despair he turns to a life of crime and eventually becomes very successful he makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl evelyn keyes who is blind he tries to go straight for her but he can't escape his life of crime or his hatred of his own scarred face br br a no budget b film very short runs only a little over an hour but well made and superbly acted by lorre this has a lot more depth than you would expect from a quickie b picture especially takes the thankless girl role and makes her character fresh and appealing this has sadly disappeared from tv and was never put on video or dvd as far as i know tcm did show it recently and it was great to see the movie still holds up br br highly recommended
<START> no or like of sand is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are this movie isn't about homosexuality but it is about sexuality br br an aloof girl will definitely make the viewers ponder who is behind the aloof girl does she love yoshida or does she love ito or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the incident i doubt it br br and what about yoshida does he realize that he loves ito in the end well we all know he loves him as a friend but you'll never know once you see this movie haha in the end along with ito delivers an exceptional message to the audience which is that it does not matter if you love a boy or a girl and i have to tell you i'm so dense that i didn't get it at first it's because of the whole no talking scenes you have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and not by what they say especially the final part whew boy that was confusing it's a confusing story but it is beautiful nonetheless this movie is certainly one of the best japanese movies i have ever seen and trust me i've seen plenty
<START> a pity nobody seems to know this little thriller masterpiece where bigger budgeted movies fail terminal choice delivers lots of thrills shocks and bloody violence a little seen gem that deserves being searched for in your local video shop that anonymous guy beneath is quite right when he says you'll never trust hospitals again it is that effective good ending too not really a twist but it doesn't end the way one thought it would yep that's ellen barkin in an early role
