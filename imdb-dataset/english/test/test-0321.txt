<START> surface is one of the best shows that i have ever seen nbc is so stupid for canceling a great show like this and worse of all only leaving it half complete nbc or someone else should give surface at least one more season just so it can be completed it's as if nbc gave you a book to read and half way through it they decide to take it away from you and then you can never find out the ending i just want to see what happens to everyone and most importantly see what happens to i think i can say this safely about most surface fans is that we want to save has taken all of our hearts away and then nbc just cuts them in two come on nbc just give surface one more season
<START> this movie was good i can't say it was one of the best but it still was good the only reason that i watched it was because of ryan phillippe he is soo hot don't get mad reese but i think that it was sort of funny not a laugh your head out kinda thing but still o k
<START> i don't usually watch hollywood dribble but i was dragged along with some friends to see this one which turned out to be amusing in places but totally devoid of any originality don't worry you won't have to think tarantino like storyline leaves enough over obvious hints for us to correctly predict where this one's going about fifteen minutes before every twist i sat there worrying that the film was building up fairly nicely for a hollywood flick but that it would have nowhere to go at the climax and boy were my fears realised ymca couldn't save this one but liv tyler almost did i suppose being male and in my twenties helped but she delivered a really good performance obviously she didn't have to do much except look absolutely stunningly over the top sexy but what she did she did well is certainly not going to go down as one of hollywood's great successes or should i say shouldn't because the mainstream american film industry is not going anywhere at present and hasn't for a decade at least save the odd hit like american beauty titanic and saving private ryan and even those had major flaws but if you're a teen male do yourself a favour and see liv she is one hot chick rating 5 10 see also anything by quentin tarantino any american teen film over the last decade anything with sex as its main selling point
<START> to say the truth i went to see this movie only because nicolas cage is my favorite actor folks may not agree but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies i haven't seen a movie with penelope before so i was anxious to see whether she is a good actress so here's what i think br br the movie is good i haven't read the novel however some moments were really thrilling and unexpected altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple so the only thing that could save the movie which an experienced viewer will know that from the beginning would either end tragically or happily was the performance of both cage and and it was great great great in the latter part of the movie i even liked a rather broad accent of the actress spanish but for those who don't speak greek that's ok and she even looks like a greek girl overall the movie is highly enjoyable and has a good deal of irony fans of classical music will surely have fun at some moments br br i give it 9 10 you should see it
<START> michael has accomplished quite a feat especially considering it is only his second start as writer producer and director generally first timers lack vision and direction when helming a major production but dominion proves mr is going places in hollywood set with beautiful scenery dominion boasts experienced cast members especially thomerson james who communicate vast vision with exceptional clarity few films can mix the slasher horror genre with a genuine action adventure feel but dominion accomplished this completely this film certainly qualifies as one of the top notch films in both of these categories if you are looking for fast paced action with more than a modicum of suspense look no further i look forward to future projects with great enthusiasm well done
<START> the cell fascinated me at first glance i was a bit surprised about that fact because the story of that movie is absolutely boring if it had no story the film would be better bunuels un chien andalou comes to my mind a film without story but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images but the cell is at first a hollywood movie and only second a piece of art i'm very interested in next project hamlet on indian could be very interesting especially when it has the same looks as the cell br br for film music enthusiasts howard shore's score for the cell is absolutely marvelous but a hard listening experience because of its very modernistic style
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen so bad it is astonishing i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film ok it wasn't his fault that someone gave him those lines but he could have refused the role and tried to learn how to act instead how did anyone get the money to put this film together is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain oh yeah they will love this one it's got no believable plot some kungfu movements chuck norris a black sidekick with bad corny lines a sweet little israeli or is he an arab or does anyone care boy pickpocket and the devil brilliant and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the human race
<START> this is movie is really bad i like to flip on the tv while napping and this movie looked like it would be something good to sleep through and boy was i wrong my body literally woke me up from sleeping and said hey this movie is awful you gotta watch it i love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots something about unintentional comedy gets me going this movie is impressively crappy i really don't know how to properly express it aside from recommending you watch it just to see how bad it is i mean seriously you should watch it with people i was making the best jokes outloud during this movie and no one was there to hear them br br worse than swimfan it's that bad
<START> am glad that i am not the only one to find this series very good this is the best series for young ladies i have so strange taste on comedies and i find so hard one to please my intelligence and i am so happy that their humor is exactly what i need love the gang of actors if anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this one i say pretty please write back because i miss the series br br and kindly ask the writers and the producers to continue it even if the actors are now all grown up i guess br br have a nice morning day evening night because i do not know the exact time you will be reading this post
<START> my mom and i rented this movie i mean we love those type of sci fi flicks whether they be big hollywood flicks or indy flicks br br but oh we were fooled two journalists are investigating a ufo abduction in a small city in texas halfway through all the sudden things get all on us my mom and i believe in god and jesus and the devil but the way this movie was preaching it made it annoying all i really have to say is that we are christian but even we like to have fun so don't blame christians as a whole just blame the christians who need to suck the fun out of this movie br br in fact you can clearly understand the directors stance on ufo's and that is that he believes it is all demonic now i could say some words but i will not all i will say is that do not watch this movie unless you feel like being preached in fact many times it states that we must be perfect in order to enter heaven well last time i checked the only perfect person died on a cross
<START> the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter's complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details br br cynthia portrays karen was not a fine election she is a good actress but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter i think that the role needed a stronger character someone with a stronger personality br br louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific she does a great job as karen's mother br br it has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album unfortunately they weren't though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries
<START> looks like the bet movie i've ever seen not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for perception sensitive antonioni is comparably wise to his movie so organic roles are so true situations are so real i've change my world outlook after this cinema i'm a beginner literati in russia country of tolstoy and and i'm quite sure watching antonioni is good and fun for russkies because i and we do understand his point of view so i don't understand his lesser on imdb i'm sure speaking from russia and our people we like antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of surrounding reality
<START> blythe danner and judith deliver wonderful performances here as jonathan silverman as eugene recounts his life in 1937's brighton beach br br what makes the film so good is the relationships among the characters with a backdrop of extremely wonderful family values br br bob dishy had a marvelous opportunity here as the father of the clan he gives a restrained but compelling performance as the patriarch of the family br br his sons played by jonathan silverman and brian dillinger are fabulous there are certain scenes when silverman is skating or hopping where i'm reminded of jerry lewis br br as for danner and they too are wonderful their mannerisms intonation and idealism of the jewish culture are beautifully realized by them br br the cinematography is just wonderful beautiful brighton in 1937 even as the inevitability of war loomed the film is rich with many of the typical problems faced by families in that period in a sense you don't have to be jewish to experience what the family is going through br br a must see for nostalgic buffs and those of us who believe so strongly in family values
<START> while the movie has its flaws it brings to light some of the problems that come with living in a country that has no democracy it makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives their struggles and a potential leader san it makes one wonder why our government will interfere places we are not wanted yet ignore those who ask our help
<START> okay so when a friend of mine told me he was supposed to direct and i thought heck i got to check out monster man and see what its like maybe i can get a part in it but when i popped it into my dvd player and and tried to choke down the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad bad i mean horribly annoying bad comedy from that fat ass thinking he's funny not to mention how the director spent on the pointless desert road trip i cam to the conclusion that these guys didn't have a clue of what they were doing and missed the boat by a long shot the story had potential to be somewhat different than the usual bs you see on the blockbuster hollywood video shelf put out by lions gate these days but they surely messed this one up why put so much time and effort in shooting annoying bad acting and bad jokes why not shorten the road trip and put more of the plot in the movie the writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the movie or maybe the director didn't shoot enough of the horror and gore that they had to find filler to make the usual 84 minutes all in all and i'm being easy here maybe because a friend of mine is the bald redneck in the bar scene that gets his skull crushed when chasing the three leads out into the street i will give it at least 1 star for trying and the gore kill scenes weren't that bad again they tried too bad lions gate could have created a cool franchise from this idea but failed i don't recommend paying to rent it maybe you can find a cut down version where the movie starts from the hitch hiker scene crap
