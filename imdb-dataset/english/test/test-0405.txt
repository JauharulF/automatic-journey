<START> surely this film was hacked up by the studio perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad criminal indeed writing and directing br br i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale br br finally not that scary indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice no need for the myth about a german mercenary although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing seeing the head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend br br no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons stilted and clipped as my parting shot
<START> just saw this film the other day at the santa fe film festival i was delighted by its honesty and humor it was the most thought provoking movie i've seen in a very long time i just can't get it off of my mind for some reason it may not be for everyone because it makes you think i don't know if people like to think in movies so much anymore which is a shame the actors who play the are quite a find i couldn't imagine playing these complicated people with such frankness though i thought a couple of the supporting characters were not as good as the i can totally forgive it because this is an important movie in my opinion i didn't expect to like it so much but as i've thought about it for a few days it's proving to be a very relevant piece of entertainment
<START> having been a marine i can tell you that the d i is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting marine corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men jack webb is excellent as sgt jim moore a tough but fair drill instructor in paris island north carolina the film centers on one recruit who doesn't seem to get with the program a more recent film full metal jacket also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing
<START> all right let's be realistic about this nobody goes into a movie produced by wwe films whose owner has challenged god to a wrestling match directed by a former porn director the man gave the world the between the cheeks trilogy starring a wrestler named kane and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter if you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time br br so what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this well here's what i was looking forward to br br 1 bad acting 2 a fairly non existent clichÃ©d storyline 3 kane walking around with a sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago 4 tons and tons of gore br br well if you're hungry for some so bad it's funny entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts br br obviously movies like this are best seen for free but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it the filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen this makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order you and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate br br i also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most i think my grand total was 107 can you beat that i personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity running water and a working elevator br br i know i know the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it br br i also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms uh huh br br i think you pretty much know what to expect but i feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings first if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away the people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show shouts of kill him kane and i hope you die first and chokeslam echoed through the theater showcasing what i hope is not the best of what america has to offer i usually don't appreciate such audience interaction but for a like this i thought the commentary added to the entertainment value however i can see how others could be annoyed by it br br second and this shouldn't even warrant explanation the film doesn't shy away from the gore if watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream fun night at the movies for ya then you know good and well to save your dough br br i must say that i was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on kane's part i wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic but i was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like say goodnight his character's last name is goodnight right before he killed a victim instead he uttered four words in the entire film nooooooo and i see it but hey he delivered them flawlessly br br if i were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like place your betts or all betts are off br br it'd rule and you know it we need a new genre term for bad horror films like see no evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic feel free to send me your suggestions for now we'll just call 'em
<START> wayne wang's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than slums of beverly hills which covers remarkably similar ground the interplay between susan sarandon and natalie portman is riveting real chemistry there this film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration susan sarandon's character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent she amazingly manages to do this without coming across as insane or intentionally sadistic and natalie portman deflects each attack on her character's ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child untainted by the smug cynicism of the natasha character in slums of beverly hills portman's character is an adolescent with dignity under stress an unusual creature in modern films the film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard i highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained
<START> i don't understand what the big hype was about this film all the horror sites were saying that this movie had all the essentials of an 'old american slasher' flick that it would satisfy your needs even though this was similar to an old american slasher flick my needs were still not satisfied br br my big problem with this movie is that we are now in the 2000's not the 1980's 1980's horror is the past and should stay in the past horror movies have changed so much that older movies now look cheesy and unrealistic even though they are fun to watch they don't offer the same realistic blood thirsty gore that the recent films offer br br hatchet is cheesy unrealistic and down right awful if we wanted to watch an old american slasher flick i can just go back to the friday the 13th series nightmare on elm street series or the halloween series i must admit the movie is better than some of the horror movies being released but it is among the worst the jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible br br i would personally stay away from this movie and never look back
<START> a talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all star high school football game when he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full scholarship if he plays well br br all too often these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen full matt certainly fits this profile but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager both over confident and vulnerable optimistic and cynical by turns influenced by amy matt grows into a man of character and heart he in turn forms friendships with his teammates which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player br br full ride has all the elements we love to see in a movie great acting admirable characters exciting sports scenes poignant drama and a love story still while one may have seen these elements in other films full ride is assisted by performances that are sincere and occasionally even moving perhaps what's most impressive about full ride is its sense of reality although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree clearly a disgruntled student who for quite obvious reasons received a poor grade in his film class director mark grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the grit of what life is like in a small town these characters are real people rooted in realistic situations which often create the most compelling entertainment on one level it is a love story on another it is a character study and yet another it is a simple football film all of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle
<START> the films of the science fiction channel sci fi channel have become boringly predictable the seem low on budget originality and plot br br in this creation the government is out to get a bunch of and recruits a poor soul by devious means to help there is plenty of over worked recycled twists on evil government organization theme black coats shadows short meaningless lines make these one dimensional cartoons br br daniel kim stands out as a good actor in a small role he brings a bit of the style of his angel character to the role it is hard to miss the link that his crusade character was a telepath and this is a film on was this a sci fi casting move to try and draw fans from the other show who knows thankfully he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch br br the movie is definitely low budget it reflects the sci fi channels current model of canadian location few well known characters few effects and woefully terrible plot and character development one would think they believe science fiction fans will view anything labeled scifi br br if you want a good telekinesis movie check out the fury 1978
<START> this movie is bad really bad so bad it made me want to shoot myself in the forehead i hated this movie first off the plot went absolutely nowhere and anything shocking about this movie was seen in the 30 second teaser trailer secondly anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was a bad movie too and completely unworthy of a remake by far the best part of the movie is the house it takes place in which is not saying much for the actual movie there were parts in the movie when the music gets very suspenseful and you're positive someone is around the corner and it turns out to be the maid or the cat but when someone actually is around the corner it is impossible to be even startled because you've been expecting it all movie so save yourself the money save yourself the time save yourself the headache and just watch the trailer there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie not in the theater not on dvd not on tv never
<START> what to say about this movie a married couple has more then just each other after playing around for some time things gets more serious a difficult choice has to be made continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart guess what happens at the end br br this movie seems to be very low budget but a good story don't have to be expensive it looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations at least very little other people visible more than just the stage in this one the house from the first minute future developments are clear as water nothing unexpected happens sometimes you may think watching a soft porn movie in which case you know in advance that there's no story br br i find this movie disappointing so that's explains the vote 4
<START> spoiler alert and i really mean it read no further unless you are prepared to have a major plot element revealed br br okay first i've gotta say that i have a relatively high tolerance for depressing films i'll watch and appreciate films about true life horrors such as war and the holocaust or where death and sadness are important to the plot but i hate films like steal magnolias and terms of endearment where the film is built around a manipulative death of a main character so already no matter how well made this film is it's got a major strike against it because one of the main characters dies from a disease at the end though they never say what he had in the english subtitled version br br so you might ask yourself then if this blow hard hates this type of film then why did he watch it in the first place you would have an excellent point to ask this though i hope i am not really a blow hard well when i found it in our local library i had no idea what it was about the movie was not intended specifically for export as the subtitles were in korean english and japanese and the box was printed all in korean well being a fan of trying films from any nation i've seen films from probably at least 30 40 different countries i gave it a try br br well apart from the obligatory death i loved the film and so hated the way it ended while i usually hate hollywood type miraculous endings i wanted to see the guy saved through some new drug or experimental surgery i was really bummed that he had to die particularly since he seemed like one of the nicest people i've seen in films in a long time his smile was infectious and i really wanted him to get the girl in the end oh well at least i can appreciate the film's message that you need to seize the moment great acting music etc but just not the most satisfying ending for me this film was good enough to encourage me to try some more korean cinema
<START> there was something about the original three films that made them so special and delightful probably the length of them unfortunately this lacks the charm but it still ends up being a fun film br br the bright shimmering side is that our favourite figures are still doing a cracking great job there is good animation used there is a silly but well structured and entertaining plot an exciting fun adventure a good plot idea a were rabbit and a giant competition and good new characters br br as well as lacking the original charm the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that the humour though good is slightly overdone especially compared to the original films br br the popular giant competition is drawing near and wallace and gromit are helping control rabbits from eating any now they are anti they are doing a good job but soon there is danger afoot a were rabbit is nearby br br recommended to all wallace and gromit fans and to people who like films enjoy wallace and gromit the curse of the wererabbit
<START> though i had sort of enjoyed the satanic rites of dracula 1974 i knew i shouldn't expect too much from its even more maligned predecessor surely the least of the hammer marcus on the audio commentary for the creeping flesh 1973 even goes so far as to call it the studio's nadir the film really flounders due to its totally and now embarrassingly dated updating of the myth the modern day setting actually suited satanic rites rather better even if truth be told it's still vastly preferable to dreck like dracula 2000 2000 or van helsing 2004 br br despite christopher lee's bashing of the film he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the undead vampire even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to one setting likewise peter cushing delivers his usual committed performance the only other noteworthy acting job in the film is that given by christopher son of director ronald as johnny alucard even if that's only because of how unbelievably hammy it is unfortunately the two best known female members of the cast both of them horror regulars stephanie beacham and caroline munro can't rise above their physical attributes br br the camera work is by dick bush who had shot the blood on satan's claw 1971 and for hammer when dinosaurs ruled the earth 1970 and twins of evil 1971 but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with ken russell which manages some nice atmosphere throughout especially during three crucial sequences the carriage ride scuffle at the properly gothic beginning the hysterical black mass sequence followed by the resuscitation of dracula and the final confrontation between lee and cushing's van helsing
<START> on the enigmatic singer songwriter who according to friends' accounts spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life seemingly on a mission of self destruction he died at 52 overweight and dissipated of heart disease after a protracted rampage of virtually non stop overindulgence in alcohol cigarettes marijuana and cocaine raucous partying and flagrant misuse of his vocal instrument he to a friend that he shouted out his lyrics at one performance with such force that spattered blood was left on the microphone br br all of this despite the fact that he was 1 widely considered to have perhaps the most gifted pop singing ability of his generation 2 successful after years of effort in terms of industry acclaim a grammy an oscar a decent recording contract with a top label and at least two stellar albums originals and 'a little touch of in the night' standards and 3 very happily married for the third time with a lovely young family that he seemed to adore br br the film's strengths begin with the completeness of its account of life including fine use of archival film footage and many stills of nilsson the editors do an especially good job of bringing movement to the stills we learn of his close ties to john lennon and later ringo starr lennon often said that nilsson was his favorite american musician br br even more impressive are the talking heads often a documentary's weakest aspect here we get people like perry botkin jr ray cooper mickey dolenz terry gilliam mark hudson eric idle rick randy newman van dyke parks jimmy webb and robin williams all telling amazing stories about nilsson Â many uproariously funny others deeply pathetic and everyone conveying their deep affection for him equally informative and moving are interview segments with wives Â annie and una his son zach and cousin doug best set of heads i can recall in a br br the most glaring deficiency of the film is that it crowds out music even the performance of his greatest hit without you is cut short after about 8 bars arrrrgh there is no excuse for this not given that the movie runs a full two hours as it is lose a few head shots and we could have heard at least that song through and perhaps one or two more like one or his oscar winning cover of everybody's talking ' the filmmakers are simply too intent on plumbing psychological mystique and not attentive enough to his music my grades 7 5 10 low b seen at the reel music series 01 07 07
<START> the lines in the title of this review are the first lines in this film's theme song a wonderfully demented parody of the in my opinion horrible song my favorite things from the sound of music and this fun little detail isn't the only aspect that makes the body shop aka doctor gore 1973 recommendable to my fellow gore trash fans the film which was created almost entirely by j g patterson jr who served as producer writer director and leading man as the eponymous dr gore is crap no doubt but it is also beyond doubt that it is amusing and that everyone involved probably patterson especially was aware that they were not exactly making a masterpiece br br dr brandon patterson a famous but totally insane plastic surgeon looses his beloved wife a model in an accident along with his hunchbacked assistant greg roy he henceforth kidnaps beautiful young women in order to build himself a new perfect wife out of their body parts br br doctor gore is doubtlessly a film of the 'so bad it's good kind' but it is also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous trashiness mad science has always been one of my absolute favorite horror topics and as a matter of fact it is also one of the coolest topics for ridiculous gore trash flicks obviously shot on a minimal budget doctor gore pays some homage to the frankenstein films especially james whale's masterpiece bride of frankenstein 1935 and resembles the look of the early troma herschell gordon lewis gore flicks such as blood feast 1963 only that this looks a lot cheaper and crappier obviously j g motive was not merely to make a fun gore flick being a rather ugly weird looking fellow his role of dr brandon gave patterson the opportunity to make out with a couple of hot scarcely dressed young women who would later end up as body part donors in dr laboratory br br most of the gore is actually pretty well made regarding the obviously tiny budget the dialogue includes some extremely hilarious lines get that it might be the door and put a coat on so they don't see you're a hunchback besides the aforementioned theme song doctor gore also includes a wonderfully crappy appearance by a country band called 'bill hicks and the my new favorite band not for the rest of the film i kept wondering whether bill hicks and roy who plays the hunchbacked assistant are twins or even the same person the two look exactly the same and having two unrelated obese red bearded guys looking this weird in one film would be a huge coincidence other than j g patterson most of the cast members never did any other films this is the first film i've seen out of the few by patterson sadly the man died of cancer in 1975 br br overall doctor gore is a film that certainly isn't for everyone as a matter of fact it is total crap but it is also amusing and recommendable to my fellow fans of weirdness and cheap camp stuff should show a from this film under flick'
