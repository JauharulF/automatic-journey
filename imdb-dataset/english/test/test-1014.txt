<START> since growing up in czechoslovakia i was following history of raf pilots and crews in wwii great britain their stories and tragic ending either in the combat or in communist prisons and camps this is without any doubt more than dark chapter in our history although the fact that those brave men we're able to go through all this and recover afterward is amazing to all people who want to see great movie this is the one during recent visit of czech republic i saw this movie three times in three days they we're just playing it for three days otherwise i will go to see it even few more times it's worth of it i hope you will enjoy it although it requires a little more thinking and knowledge of background information behind the story pretty much same way that the movie kolya was it's not a simple movie because of it's deep story and the way its told will most likely make you crying it did to me three times in row zdenek sverak did as always a great script his son jan made a great movie and the cast without doubt all of them did great job i was amazed by ondrej by great role played by kaiser and all other actors which made this movie simply great if this is not an oscar nomination i think that i will be on strike in
<START> rutger hauer helps along a film that basically can be summed up in the young person finding themselves category and rather obviously so so it needs a lot of help br br the beginning holds a lot more promise of a film that could turn into michael clayton or stranger than fiction it's too bad because i really got hooked into the beginning then like the opening soundtrack it went from great and intriguing to basically nowhere br br it's fun enough with plenty of and interesting characters acted well i'm sure that will be enough for many people the problem is it all feels contrived and empty which ironically is supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self realization not the film itself it's not a self aware film but that the character is supposed to recognize his own life is contrived and empty
<START> i've seen this film so many times it's that good maybe because i can relate to way of life is the reason why not everyone would find it to their taste also my is improving after each viewing am i a sad case thankyou mr i look forward to your next film although i did not see the film at a cinema i have the dvd and would encourage anyone to buy it the special feature extras alone is worth the price the amount of time a director spends on the making of a film is very seldom appreciated the extras on the dvd gives an excellent insight to the making of a film as for the story of the film i'm bias i happen to rave about it to all my friends but as i said before i relate very much to the main character who is a loner in a situation not of his own choosing the mafia in sicily use to their money in a swiss bank he owes them for costing them millions of dollars years ago in stock market deal that went wrong love kills
<START> all i can say is that i was expecting a movie and blurred surprised me on the positive way very nice teenager movie all this kinds of situations are normal on school life so all i can say is that all this reminded me my school times and sometimes it's good to watch this kind of movies because entertain us and travel us back to those golden years when we were young as well lead us to think better in the way we must understand our children because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present time try this movie and you will be very pleased at the same time you will have the guarantee that your time have not been wasted
<START> tart is a good illustration of old the yogi berra saying if you don't know where you are going you will probably end up someplace else writer director christina in her first feature has managed to make a 3 million movie that ends up someplace else tart is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with a black comedy without any humor or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy br br unlike the standard swain film tart actually employed a competent and experienced production designer good enough to provide two extremely nice shots the scene of swain and barton taking a bubble bath together and the scene of swain in the park featuring a nice montage of the alice in wonderland sculpture the symbolism incorporated into these elements supports the possibility that despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone actually has some visionary talent and aspirations for making a quality film br br it is even possible that was trying for a fusion of the somewhat expressionistic metropolitan and the camp classic cruel intentions which also deal with the manhattan upper class there are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes the former technique hinting at symbolism and the latter at intentional distancing from the characters and their motivations tart seemed on the verge of veering into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction first there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased swain into the garbage chute then there is the whole bit about her father being jewish played to the same extreme as joel grey dancing with the jewish guerrilla in cabaret br br in her other films swain's acting technique is to overwhelm each scene in which she appears insert scenery chewing here but in tart she actually shows an ability to restrain herself this is the best performance of her career it also provides some clues about her physical deterioration from willowy super cute in girl to hulking lumpy faced in pumpkin this transformation was about half complete by the time she made tart so go the ravages of time br br mischa barton sixth i feel better girl and lacey are excellent in supporting roles the rest of the cast is simply horrible although some of the blame for this should go to script and direction
<START> this movie has the feel of a college project over it who wants to do a blair witch project meets saw theme but it isn't successful the cinematography is poor and the acting even more so the characters in my opinion doesn't come off as being credible at all the editing of the film isn't really working as intended either there are a lot of poor effects which i believe are put in there to try and add a horrid effect but to me it just gives me a feeling of indifference br br i would stay away from this movie unless you are a dedicated movie freak who likes to watch different and indie horror movies however i believe this movie is not worth watching for the average person you will get no pleasure out of the poor effects and the handycam feel which this movie on it's viewers
<START> the movie starts in spring 2001 a soldier named john channing tatum falls in love with college student savannah amanda while on break within the space of two weeks they fall madly in love with each other but he has to go off to war and she has to go to college they do but keep in touch by writing to each other then 9 11 happens he wants to she wants him to stay home what will they do br br hysterically bad romantic drama the leads are attractive tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body he's introduced walking shirtless out of the water after surfing but he can't act is a beautiful woman and she tries but the dialogue here is horrible when i saw it me and a friend of mine were fighting hard not to laugh out loud at some of the romantic dialogue at the beginning it was just horrible for the first hour or so i was either bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrendous romance then after that first hour tragedy kicks in and i must admit had me in tears however the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure that you're crying with death funerals and meetings with people breaking down in tears how can you not cry this would have worked if the acting were better tatum's face never changes expression not once he always had a blank look on his face was a little better but not much to make it worse tatum and had no sexual chemistry on screen at all they barely looked like they liked each other let alone love each other there was some beautiful photography of the carolinas but this is a boring and stupid romantic drama a 1 all the way and i usually love silly romantic dramas like this
<START> excellent and highly under rated from beginning to end one of oliver's best well scripted directed shot acted and soundtrack trivia the music during the end credits vaguely sounds like a late 90's pop hit by band br br eric and cast are brilliant let alone the callers what a whirlwind of emotions it make's your hair stand on end necks will be broke and whips will crack in a old female southern accent creepy scary than any horror movie br br 10 out of 10 br br em
<START> imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience grey instead of white no snow fights and certainly no this is the finland as portrayed by land' this film follows a bunch of people whose lives are oddly linked to each others' with results beyond anyone's nightmares yes most characters are flawed in the way that only celluloid characters can completely annoying and frustrating to watch yet for some reason you wish for their luck to turn br br with some randomly placed humour and a cast that groups together finland's somewhat mainstream faces frozen land offers a glimpse of the finnish mentality that despite its depressing downward spirals manages to restore some faith in humanity more so than to say the least
<START> in out made me want to vomit i have never seen such a shameless film it seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyous but has no idea how to say it to me this was not a comedy unless cruel sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it br br from what i saw this film had four 4 major flaws starting with a matt character as he announces to the world that is former teacher howard brackett kevin kline is gay never mind how unbelievable it is that matt dillion character won an oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack up but why would he say such a thing after all this was never an issue with howard's students his friends family nor his nobody so why would he say something like it when it wasn't true more to the point why doesn't the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it the reason is because there is no answer and for the convenience of the plot none is provided the second b flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex in this movie being gay is based on liking barbara streisand musicals and being passionate about literature it's all based on stereotypes br br both of these flaws are met up again at that must be seen to be believed graduation ceremony matt dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the film looks poised to let us know what made him say such a thing when he arrives to the ceremony he says nothing and i wondered why in the world he then came there at all he didn't solve anything then when all of the audience stood to announce they were gay i was so moved i wanted to throw up those folks were standing up in defense of howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes what the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why howard was gay they filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot but wait there's more br br during the ceremony c howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay what the film was trying to say is that homosexuals never recruit and that he wouldn't influence his students but did we not see tom character endlessly pressure howard over and over again even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly to come out of the closet when in my mind there was no closet to come out of from that the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of recruiting the film again then shoots itself in the foot br br and d when howard came out of the closet did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film i counted only three lines he had afterwards yup to his parents hi there to a student and are you ready to tom selleck before the last vomitous scene i might be low by one but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay i wanted to know what was in his head because i never for once believed he was gay br br as bonuses the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes one in which howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend him who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance does that make him gay he asks the priest oh yes he's definitely gay uh huh or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling howard's mother that she doesn't need to be sad about her son's deep dark secret because well everyone has them then one the ladies confessed that she's never seen the bridges of madison county funny no becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he she is gay i know i have several friends that are gay and none of their families took it well at all that was a poor way to the whole situation br br the last straw for me was the last scene that gave they appearence that tom and kevin were getting married the camera panned down very slowly to the front of the church when it wasn't what you thought i had been thoroughly disgusted by that point and i never could forgive that sick joke i have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality philadelphia and longtime companion were very honest and true in what they had to say in out is just screaming for political correctness but has no idea of the corruption at its core what i gathered from the film is that if you are 99 straight and 1 gay meaning if you have the doubt you are definitely gay it's like gayness is becoming a dominant trait in genetics in reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid you would eventually believe it too wouldn't you this is what happened to howard brackett about being gay i left the theater sad and angry angry the whole weekend in fact this was a seriously sick and cruel film the worst of 1997
<START> this movie was not very good in my opinion while not a complete waste of an hour and a half luckily i didn't have to pay for it it just wasn't very scary there were parts where i jumped and a few minimally violent gory scenes but overall only someone easily frightened would consider this movie scary br br the overall writing and acting were very weak the characters never evolved or grew as people even at the end the lead guy whatever his name was didn't man up and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute the plot also had inconsistencies the police officer who was killed was not murdered in the same way he died in the game the girl october mentioned that in order to kill the evil demon lady you had to read something from the correct text funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape the malcolm in the middle kid died in the game but didn't die in real life also making the game play by itself was very weak writing it would have been okay for the brother's death just to get them playing again but you are supposed to play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again why do you even need the game if you like movies like the ring and thing its scary and fun watch this movie if you know someone like that you can watch it with at laugh at do it if you like horror movies that make you laugh out loud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free do it otherwise stay far far away
<START> a less than redemptive junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence some northern idiots come to the deep south looking for some confederate rifles stashed on the legendary whiskey mountain they are menaced by scary hillbillies in a wide nod to 'deliverance' but it turns out that the hicks are for a northern marijuana trafficking badass this is brought to light so early that it doesn't even qualify as a twist the women are locked up and raped into catatonia rather than rescuing them the guys run down to town to get the sheriff who is lazy and doesn't believe them i think if my girlfriend were being raped i'd kind of take the shortest route to the hideout anyway it's ok though because as soon as they show up to the baddies the girls get all cheery and hop around if only trauma were like this in real life also featuring a backwoods guy with a beard who cackles a lot not exactly bursting at the seams with ideas
<START> i always loved this film the music story and the action i especially love the opening and closing of the film the music stayed with me throughout the years the wwi plane battles were great and the comedy is typical blake edwards is his forte' after all julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen the sets and the scenes are wonderful the characters are appealing i loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and julie's singing to them i wish she sang to me in vietnam i also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the wwi music i was glad when the dvd arrived now i can whistle in the dark watching it again and again
<START> i saw the original rough screen showing 4 times at gencon a couple years ago i was delighted to have done so my daughter is in the movie br br i stood in the back of the room with her watching the much younger fans sit on the edge of there seats dead quiet no wanting to miss a line the standing ovation was like watching the fans when the usa hockey team beat the russians at the olympic games in montreal br br i love excellent comedy and sight gags taxi barney miller cheers frasier and married with are my all time favorite comedy shows lesser shows i will not even watch br br this movie will do for gamers what animal house did for college frat days what dodge ball did for weird sports forget the lack of a mega budget backing the production this is pure art it's that good br br i could not be happier for the entire cast and production company
<START> well i'm a few days late but what the hell anyways the word that best describes my reaction to see no evil was surprise the film is actually pretty good there is definitely an ample amount of blood gore action in the film with a modest amount of suspense it hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's early 80s think madman meets leatherface with a dash of norman bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick while is thin on plot most horror films are it kind of makes up for it in the violence methods of killing the gore suspense the fact that kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed jacob goodnight the title of the film comes from the fact that jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers stores them in big jars why you'll just have to watch it see pun intended there are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably psycho tcm madman but they're not blatant finally really doesn't go into territory we long timers haven't seen before granted is no or tcm 74 but it certainly merits a look imo br br recommendation take in a matinÃ©e showing of see no evil rating 7 5 10
