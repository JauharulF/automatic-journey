<START> 1st movie comment ever i'll start with saying come on wasn't that bad was it no it that bad actually i laughed and giggled enough times through the movie so i cannot say with hand on my heart that it was rubbish br br it's completely different this and epic movie epic movie sucked bad doh how so people would ask i'll tell you how this movie is not as nearly as pointless not to mention that the stupid and i say stupid because it is but being stupid makes it funny stuff that happens around and with the characters is actually enjoyable in this movie not the best around but hey what would you expect look at the poster some people said it was stupid i find that when writing a comment one should be more objective my own opinion but yeah of course it was stupid it's a movie about stupid look i'm not telling you to go and watch the movie now or else you missed the event of the century what i am telling is that if you happen to see the movie somewhere please don't carve your eyes on the opening credits see what it's all about who knows you might like it a bit br br i give it 4 10 for not being so bad and making me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex related jokes
<START> i was stunned by this film i have been renting antonioni's films rediscovering them and this film showed me the climax and fruits of his 50 years of directing what an eye for setting color and detail i have never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before i had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears yes beauty moves me like it moved keats to write ode on a urn this movie is made for the mature emotionally and intellectually audience those hoping to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed i will have to see this film several times before i can truly appreciate it and judge it this film should be required viewing for all cinematographers and directors br br possibly a truly great film on the order of kurosawa's dreams
<START> what happened to ava gardner in the 1940s and marilyn monroe in the '50s also seemed to take place for modern day actress michelle pfeiffer in the '80s her remarkable good looks got in the way of her being taken seriously as an accomplished superbly talented actress anyone looking for validation of dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in 1991's frankie and johnny or love field a personal favorite of mine those looking to see what a splendid comedic actress she can be when given the right part should check out 1988's married to the mob in this one she plays angela demarco the widow of a recently iced mob hit man who moves from her garishly tacky long island home to start a new life for herself and her son while being pursued by mob boss dean stockwell and fbi man matthew modine while this movie has lots going for it a very amusing script offbeat characters sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence as in director jonathan demme's previous effort something wild and hilarious yet menacing performances by stockwell and mercedes ruehl as his jealous wife from hell michelle steals the show easily notice how perfectly she nails angela's long island italian accent and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this spunky and surprisingly bright character once upon a time long ago oscars were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one had this film been made 60 years ago michelle been a
<START> the success of the original french emmanuelle series i've only watched the first which wasn't too bad considering led to a spate of imitations the italian counterpart which even changed the race of its heroine was clearly less polished and more exploitative descending more and more into vulgarity as the series went along incredibly there were 16 black emanuelle films in total with the heroine even having the spelling of her name changed to avoid copyright issues still laura gemser the titular object of desire became almost as much of an icon as the original emmanuelle sylvia kristel although personally she's too skinny for my tastes here she's even billed as emanuelle rather than with her real name with the director likewise becoming albert thomas br br in itself the film offers little of interest as a matter of fact one would do best to approach it as a travelogue with some decent footage of the african wildlife with respect to the sex scenes i don't know how complete the version i watched was but while there was a lot of nudity none of it was very explicit or even titillating the scene that came closest perhaps was when gemser who works as a photographer and her companion karin schubert turn the camera on each other naturally sans clothes in the middle of the jungle the film also features an artist made up to look like salvador dali but mercifully perhaps his scenes do not take much of the running time the score by nico is typically bland 70s pop and really nothing to write home about
<START> my only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie i felt that i had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me br br the movie must be just about the worst film i ever seen i really do believe that the script may have seen to been able to become a pretty good movie or at least ok but somewhere on the line something happened what makes it even more odd is the fact that the cast appears to be quite alright on paper put to practice both script and the cast fails to deliver there are to much action it happens to much things and you can't help wonder why it happens and then the cast the actors make such a poor effort that you almost start to cry br br if you have to much time at hand i would say you can see it if not don't
<START> this movie is the final straw as two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy this movie has finally made us realise that nothing good has come out of this genre since love actually there was nothing good about the film whatsoever it was an affront to love death and everything in between including horses and beaches there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters this movie took the spark out of nicholas sparks diane lane cannot act to save her life she was unconvincing in her laugh cry and dance and she needs a better haircut there is no reason to watch this movie save yourself the romantic comedy is officially dead
<START> a great suspenseful thriller the acting is first rate and the plot keeps you guessing this well performed and directed movie is based on a true story and well worth while joe penny is cast extremely well and ann gillian is convincing as the and terrified sister joe again prove he's acting ability is amazing and the ending well done it s worth watching i hope they repeat it soon on any channel i will definitely record it for penny and gillian fans it's worth your time rent it if you can better still try to buy it i going to perfect early nineties thriller watch this br br movie it's great
<START> despite its age this film retains its undoubted charm and attraction and is a fine surviving example of early british cinema it has an underlying air of eeriness interspersed with shafts of humour which are not out of place and serve to demonstrate the assured direction production values involved so many episodic type films are disjointed and untidy but this is not one of them the standard of acting helps a great deal and the various disparate characters come across as interesting and believable all in all this long forgotten little gem is well worth anyone's attention in spite of the one jarring note in the film which surprisingly escaped the censor's attention
<START> i'm sorry but i don't understand how the studio get's away with this the movie is just not worth it maybe as a theater play but certainly not as a movie and why do they call it a thriller the acting is good but i expect anything less from these perfect actors robert redford plays very well and willem dafoe is convincing enough as the softy bad guy helen mirren can play almost any role and always still looks beautiful to me i'm also a fan of her british detectives still they just can't save this ow so boring movie i'm sorry i hope we don't get to many movies anymore from this director jan cause he obviously doesn't now the meaning of the words suspence and thriller
<START> stalwart morally upright military doctor lieutenant claude de ross solid claudio cassinelli and several other shipwreck survivors wash ashore on a remote tropical island that's governed with an iron fist by the ruthless and sadistic edmund superbly played to the deliciously slimy hilt by richard johnson who lives on the island with the feisty amanda martin a winningly spunky performance by the ravishing barbara bach and her unhinged rogue biologist father professor ernest martin a marvelously dotty portrayal by joseph cotten moreover de ross discovers that professor martin has control over a dangerous race of beasts who are being exploited as slave labor by director co writer sergio martino relates the lively and absorbing story at a constant snappy pace offers a flavorsome evocation of the lush and remote tropical setting does an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in the spooky opening third further spices things up with a nice line in dry humor and stages the exhilarating action loaded climax with considerable rip roaring aplomb while the central premise is obviously inspired by the island of dr moreau the story nonetheless is given a great deal of freshness and intrigue because of martino's artful melding of such diverse elements as voodoo the lost underwater city of atlantis a rousing mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption buried treasure unscrupulous genetic experiments and even some exciting fisticuffs between de ross and during the thrilling conclusion into an altogether dynamic imaginative and often immensely entertaining whole the sound acting by the sturdy cast qualifies as another substantial plus cassinelli makes for a likable hero johnson essays his juicy villain part with supremely lip smacking aplomb bach rates as a quite fetching damsel in distress plus there are neat supporting contributions by beryl cunningham as sinister voodoo priestess franco as the superstitious jose and roberto posse as surly troublemaker peter giancarlo fernando's sumptuous widescreen cinematography delivers a wealth of striking visuals while luciano throbbing tribal score hits the funky spot the amphibious humanoid creatures are pretty gnarly looking too an extremely fun flick
<START> i wouldn't call myself a big fan of the genre inventive silliness so i might not be the best audience for this show although being a critic i do have a sense for what i personally like and dislike this being the later br br lack of humor is a big turnoff when it comes to comedy things can be catchy cool and perky for about 4 minutes and after that you start getting bored unless its the badger animation from a couple of years ago this is the exact opposite with a stiff script and all overacted voice overs its just plain silly and very very boring to be subjected to unfortunately since it did have a big market ahead of itself and a lot of potential br br a waste of time
<START> unless you're interested in seeing 2 hours worth of scenic mountain footage featuring hysterical characters lots of histrionics and cheap 70s gore not much of it either i would advise to avoid this movie it is long winded overlong and has a rather annoying amateurish feel to it masterpiece no an average thriller shot in an average fashion in a gorgeous italian landscape br br i'm a huge fan of slow paced 1970 movies when there is a plot to delight and entertain you in this case it didn't work out for me the plot is trite interlaced with superficial and stereotypical characters backed by hilarious angry mobs and your typical italian widow dressed all in black sobbing br br if you are not acquainted and familiar with the italy country side the movie might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and rather breathtaking this movie isn't however nothing out of the ordinary there are much better italian horror flicks than this not much else than a yawn fest 5 10
<START> i just saw this movie last night and after reading all the reviews i expected a good emotional sports film what i got was something clichÃ©d and boring yes i thought it was boring i saw the all star getting hurt long before the game i figured maybe they'd wait for him to collapse until ya know the game before the big one but i guess the first game is good enough br br the parental relationships were also very clichÃ©d with the dominating drunk father i will say mcgraw impressed me however and the boy who wants to stay and help his ailing mother br br i especially liked the random girls melissa and maria who were in the movie for all of 5 minutes and placed there simply to get the football boys some action off the field i thought ok now how does this work into the plot again maybe i missed the point beyond well they play football in a town that loves it so the girls throw themselves at their feet point br br the sports action had some good points but most of it was so rushed i think the first game lasted longer than the montage of the entire playoffs and i wasn't so sure about the continuity of the winding down clock in the final game br br i guess i could see this movie winning the espy for best sports film if it was the only one released honestly though i found it to be a boring movie full of people sickeningly obsessed with the for a better football film see remember the titans
<START> this era was not just the dawn of sound in cartoons but of a cartoon character which would go down in history as the world's most famous mouse yes mickey makes his debut here in this cheery tale of life on board a steamboat the animation is good for it's time and the plot though a little simple is quite jolly a true classic and if you ever manage to get it on video you won't regret it
<START> so many early british sound films that i've seen on video suffer from either poor print transfer quality or poor sound or both fortunately i was able to obtain a copy of this movie on a video of excellent quality enabling me to focus on the story itself br br and an excellent story it was at first sight the passengers on the ill fated bus looked like a pretty boring lot except for the always lovely jessie matthews but as the film went back to show each passenger's story on the day before the accident i discovered that the cast contrary to initial appearance was a talented group of performers skillfully directed so as to bring a real individuality to their distinctive characterizations br br viewers may have different preferences as to which two passengers are going to meet a tragic end and which ones will survive but the movie holds your interest as it keeps you guessing this film deserves a much wider audience a real gem of early british cinema
