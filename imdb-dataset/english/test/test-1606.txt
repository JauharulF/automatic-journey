<START> will some company please make a good dvd of this film aside from being a wonderful film about relationships and friendships four friends is the only film i've ever seen and i have literally spent years of my life watching films that captures the essence of the 60s experience and i was there the idealism the hope the freedom the confusion the betrayals and ultimately its upbeat but bittersweet denouement and all of this is accomplished without being a story about any of the numerous upheavals of that era although many are just touched upon as part of the tapestry but the story is primarily about the characters and their friendship over about 10 15 years and that those survived and deepened despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade absolutely a joy and must see film even if one's not an old hippie
<START> after i saw la pianiste several years ago i said to myself that i would never see it again so powerful and disturbing it was time went on but i could not get the movie and its main character erika out of my mind the story of a respected piano teacher in vienna conservatory cool and collected on the surface an expert in classical music with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear self loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing i read the book the piano teacher by elfriede jelinek the controversial nobel prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it i saw the film again second time all pieces of puzzle came to the right places not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as le pianiste three actors gave outstanding performances franz schubert's piano music soaked in the morbid humanity is another bright star of the movie br br i only have one problem with haneke's vision there is a scene in the film where haneke made some changes to erika's character comparing to the novel in the book the furthest she went to reveal herself to walter the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her was in a letter as soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that she had stopped communicating with him erika of the book would never chase walter to throw herself to him she kept everything inside she did not like to act she was not a chaser she loved to watch the big scene during the hockey game was not necessary it tried to make erika sympathetic and of course huppert was heartbreaking but it took the mystery that surrounded her jelinek did not write that scene it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film
<START> this piece of crap is actually the bomb as in bottom of the barrel i can't figure out which is worst norris' dull portrayal of anonymity not a great trait in an action protagonist or christopher hysterical overacting this film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever the action sequences are tame the plot is paper thin and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a clichÃ© from the fifties you can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits and expect the audience to scream in terror br br visually the film does nothing for me it actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn flick and a miami vice rip off with a little sprinkling of hell spawn no wait that should have been hell yawn
<START> i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about tudor england br br the writing directing and editing of this tv movie for the most part was truly awful i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a movie br br first there were too many cut's between important parts and leaving out important events which happened at the time one is henry's fall out with rome over his desire to divorce katherine of aragon which led to england's breaking away from rome and establishing her own church they barely stuck to the book at all i'm all for creative freedom but to a limit especially when your dealing with a well written book as your starter point in the book mary birth to young catherine first and then she has young henry is born both their father is henry's the eight in the movie they show harry's first then catherine and suggest that catherine father is william carey br br there are too many bad moment's in the movie to write them all br br i will however say that may and natascha mcelhone portrayal as the boleyn sisters was probably the best part of the movie br br if you haven't read the book and know nothing about the 8 court i will recommend to stay away from this movie and for those who read the book the movie will annoy you for it's lack of details and important plot's
<START> i love this movie sure i love it because of madonna but who cares it's damn funny alanis rocks when i first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987 i thought it was all out hilarious madonna is so funny and i love her dubbed accent and wacky funky look the all time funniest part is when madonna nikki screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi and also when griffin dunne trips and falls at the apartment interview scene alanis rocks madonna's character nikki steals shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time didn't rob nothin' when you rob a store you stick up the cashier we busted a few tapes there's a bit of a difference i love that it's classic alanis rocks i don't know why this movie got slammed the way it did i see nothing wrong with it course maybe if you're a huge madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome anyone out there who wants to see some funny classic entertainment then watch who's that girl and another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist alanis will always rock ya completely to the end so does madonna in this film and just entirely her acting is superb
<START> everything is illuminated is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality artwork it absolutely the emotions through a very broad spectrum jonathan safran foer is played with candor by elijah wood he is in search of his paternal heritage in the ukraine his travels bring him in contact with alex played very well and with extreme humor by eugene his grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is aptly portrayed by boris if one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema then one has only to turn to a real dog who is called sammy davis jr jr by alex and his grandfather they also call him the seeing eye bitch the cinematography is spectacular the colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film it is a film worth the time and emotional investment
<START> this movie is extremely funny and enjoyable with suitable funny and experienced casts i find this movie enjoyable not only by the elements of humor but also the music in various scenes kevin kline a good comedian has done a good job at being funny in many parts of the film along with tom selleck who is amazingly different from many of his other films the humor within this film are goofy which makes various exaggerations within many scenes especially the beginning bits joan cusack is also remarkably funny and exaggerated and the same goes for all the other casts this film has many elements of goofy humor and is enjoyable if you want to laugh
<START> at the opposite end of the spectrum from raiders of the lost ark is david utterly inferior adventure regarding the salvage of a world war ii era plane with a valuable cargo assets include beautiful new zealand settings brian may's energetic music score and some dandy helicopter flying and jet boat chases the bad however far outweighs the good donald pleasence hams as perhaps never before half of his dialog is almost unintelligible george peppard attempts an australian i think accent then gives it up halfway through lesley ann warren is at her most irritating ken is well ken the dialog is painful to hear and direction is largely inept the script is not only obvious but terrible jokes fall flat scenes carry no punch and continuity is virtually non existent according to the end credits two men were killed piloting jet boats during the making of the film what a waste
<START> a lot of good things could have been done with this movie using essentially the same sets plot devices and storyline for example why not plant a seed of capability before the murder of her lover why not develop erica and the cop's relationship slowly and convincingly maybe contrast eric's by including some other post event facet relationship etc in her life that she now rejects why not have her injure an innocent bystander to underscore the in actions br br instead exploits the revenge fantasy to its maximum level giving insincere lip service to the don't do this at home messages thrown in only to allow the film to qualify as legitimate br br i'm not a jodie foster fan after displaying some range in films like silence of the lambs nell and one where she plays the ordinary mother of a child prodigy foster has slipped into a succession of roles where she plays the same hard bitten heroine single handedly overcoming evil such is fine once or twice but i'm getting too used to her fight versus flight close up could have used a younger actress or one that more convincingly embraced being a woman in her forties instead of 40 something foster playing a younger woman br br is a movie with substantial actors financing and resources that manages to descend to junk
<START> this is an awful movie from just about every point of view since much has been already pointed out in previous reviews let me just focus on serbs and delta force guys in this movie br br 1 the uniforms that serbs wear are not serbian and helmets are wrong too br br 2 the actors who play serbs are not speaking serbian not even a language close to serbian unlike in behind enemy lines where the czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least a bit of credibility to the movie br br 3 the gray bearded serbian general looks and acts like a moron firing his gun whenever us soldiers call his name br br us soldier give up br br gray bearded moronic general fires his br br us soldier come out br br fires his br br us soldier you're surrounded br br fires his br br prop guy excuse me mr gray bearded moronic general see we're out of blanks and i sent the boy to buy some more but he's not back yet br br click br br 4 since when does the army issue to the delta force i guess they couldn't find enough working in bulgaria but there were plenty of old and practice blanks maybe they should have went for some they are cheaper and wouldn't have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway br br 5 in the scene where a officer is hanging on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time no sane person with any weapons training or just plain common sense would ever do that i guess the actor figured that his coolness level increases the longer he holds the gun that way br br this movie is such an insult to common sense
<START> what a crazy film it lasts 12 hours and you don't understand who these people are and what are they doing the main plot is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring on scene prometheus but there are lots of sub plots like the disappearing of thomas and a crazy guy looking for monsieur what's the meaning of all this
<START> lou costello sans abbott plays a small town self employed rubbish collector and the inventor of a time controlling machine who is secretly courting the niece of the town big shot after a spat lou's girl dorothy runs into a misty cave why it's misty we never learn and emerges as a 30 foot giant is certainly a good sport and she doesn't bother trying not to look ridiculous it would've been impossible anyway yet the screenwriter is really cruel to this character turning her not only into a giant but a nagging harpy as well bosses costello around while creating havoc with the army troops who get called in but nothing funny is done with the transformation trumped by attack of the 50 ft woman the previous year the film does feature lou costello in his final bow but provides little else the special effects are marginal while the script needed funnier lines and the direction pacing 1 2 from
<START> what can i say not as bad as many here have made it out to be the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before was strictly for ian mcshane br br i was not disappointed in the least ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role he's always great to watch and for my money an extremely underused actor br br as for the rest of the film every other actor in the movie delivered strong solid performances these people certainly weren't being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation as this was a fairly low budget film but this did not mean that any of them mailed their appearances in everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them br br i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul's performance though i must admit i have only ever seen him in the highlander television series before this movie br br the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film anybody who expected a clear cut by the numbers connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie clearly wasn't watching the film closely enough this film is not going to tell you what the meaning of life is the idea is that after seeing the film you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee i certainly did br br no car chases no explosions no bar room brawls sounds pretty dull huh but the reality is that i was completely absorbed by the film and it's just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved br br warning if you're the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous question as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly br br you might not enjoy this film
<START> the golden door is for this viewer the finest film of the year to date it is a masterpiece of concept writing directing acting and cinematography more importantly this radiantly beautiful film is a much needed reflective mirror for us to view the history of immigration of into america at a time when the very mention of the word is a political fuse writer director emanuele has given us not only a deeply moving story he has also provided a touchstone for viewers to re visit the history of each of our origins with the exception of the native americans we all entered america as at some point in our histories and it is humbling to view this film with that fact in mind br br the film opens in turn of the century sicily as poverty stricken widower salvatore mancuso vincenzo amato and his brother angelo francesco climb a rocky hill to present their tokens to the cross to ask for a sign as to whether they should continue to struggle for existence on the island or go to america the land of dreams deaf mute son pietro runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with images of america money growing on trees fruits and vegetables larger than people etc and salvatore accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to america after convincing his reluctant mother aurora and his sisters rita de cola and rosa isabella to make the trip he sells his only possessions two donkeys goats and rabbits and the man with the boat arranges their trip giving the family shoes appropriate clothing and instructions to board an ocean liner as third class passengers as the mancuso family prepares to board they are asked for a photograph and as they pose behind a painted set an englishwoman lucy charlotte gainsbourg walks into the photo as though she were part of this peasant family lucy cannot board the boat for america without male escort br br the voyage begins and in her gentle way identifies with the mancuso family finally her safe passage by proposing to salvatore to marry her 'for convenience not for love' when they arrive in america through a violent storm and living conditions that are appalling poor the multitude of third class passengers survive bond and eventually arrive at ellis island believing their dream of america has been fulfilled but everyone must pass harsh physical tests de lousing and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter america the officials let them know that america does not want genetically inferior people entering the new world each woman must be selected by a man to marry on ellis island before they are allowed admission the manner in which the mancuso family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the closing of the tale br br few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment immigrants face or at least faced at the turn of the century on ellis island and if we do we have elected to submerge that information the golden door presents the case for struggles in a manner that not only touches our hearts but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation but all political issues aside the golden door is first and foremost a film of enormous beauty exquisite photography deeply felt performances by a huge cast and a very sensitively written and directed story the is a film that deserves wide distribution a movie that is a must see for everyone highly recommended grady harp
<START> jeff speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial artists turned actors lower than don the dragon wilson for example and with vehicles like the expert you can see why there are three major problems with this movie 1 the plot or should i say plots are all over the place there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose 2 there are only 4 fight scenes in total some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark 3 the music score is overzealous and overbearing strange as it may seem this is really the most annoying thing about this film the score persistently tries to convince you that you're watching some sort of grand epic instead of the low budget limited action film you are indeed watching with all that said at least there's james brolin around to lend a touch of credibility 1 2 out of 4
