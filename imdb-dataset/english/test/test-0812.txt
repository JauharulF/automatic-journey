<START> fox is pretty lame they cancel the wrong shows it's bizarre that they would cancel a well written program like arrested development and yet they keep this show and war at home i feel that fox loved that they broke barriers with the then edgy married with children but now it's just getting ridiculous the loop is a pointless and boring watch and their edgy jokes just fall flat in order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming family guy and the simpons work because there is a constant flow of jokes fox needs to pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe i mean if you're going to invest money into making something entertaining make it entertaining also stop using no named actors it's great to have up and comers but you need to anchor a show with a noted celebrity duh fox
<START> i saw the greek tycoon when it first came out in 1978 i found it extremely boring i thought it was no better than a travelogue except for one thing for the first time in my life i realized why it would be good to be rich seeing the scenery off aristotle yacht and getting my first real peek into the lifestyle of the rich and famous opened my eyes to paraphrase martha stewart it was a good thing funny i don't remember the sex scene i hadn't seen the movie since it was on the big screen and found the lovemaking session with the mistress memorable this time maybe because i was younger and single back then it was no big deal
<START> this film may be great but it is a complete ripoff of bill forsythe's comfort and joy c j is one of the sweetest films i've ever seen without becoming diabetic br br it's ok if you do like it but realize that everything in this film is a direct rip off br br the original is http us imdb com title i can recommend almost anything by forsythe local hero gregory's girl that sinking feeling i better go rent some tonight local has a young peter capaldi and an old burt lancaster br br unfortunately he's given up film making after some really crappy hollywood treatment sad
<START> this movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is it is a movie both for children and parents and it is timeless i saw this movie before ocean's eleven and must admit that the actors in oe has class in advance but the play of is much more down to earth and moving why i say ocean's eleven is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and is that good that it can bear comparison with oe the 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe compared to what we are used to in denmark the different cases of impossible acts is handled in a way that you wouldn't belive from many young actors and sometimes not even from the old boys the story again it has things in common with ocean's eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in they need to climb up to the the part in which the young people has to take care of younger brother gives a fine element in the movie try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a nappy on your arm br br this movie can bear comparison with most grown up movie like and ocean's eleven yes i do believe it is that good it is best to see it in a theater as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever br br regards
<START> this is the best work i have ever seen on television the story is compelling all the more so because it is true the writers did their homework the accuracy of events is well documented the acting is great this has to be the best role sam waterston has ever had and the black and white cinematography was exceptional my only regret is that it is not available to buy a few years ago i contacted someone involved with the production either with pbs or in england and was told they had no plans to release it on vhs at the time this was a bbc production and ran in the u s on american playhouse there is such an interest in seeing this just hard to believe no one can make it available
<START> great movie in a trainspotting style being billed as the welsh trainspotting but then so was twin town although this is streets ahead br br takes in a weekend in the life of cardiff clubbers good debut movie from kerrigan and some great performances in the cast br br go see then go clubbing
<START> albert pyun presents his vision of the lost city of atlantis and it's a vision so cluttered up with claustrophobic settings weird costumes and noisy quirky minor characters that one thing is for sure you want to get the hell outta there as soon as possible unfortunately it will take you about 80 minutes the alice in wonderland like story is meandering and uninteresting and there was probably no actress in the world who could have turned this into a good movie though kathy ireland makes an appealing annoying voice and all attempt 1 2
<START> this super creepy southern gothic melodrama stars clint eastwood as a wounded confederate officer in the civil war who's taken in by a rural girls' school and nursed back to health a weird clash of genders ensues with the supposedly dangerous male falling prey to a batch of seemingly harmless women who prove themselves to be every bit as brutal as the men waging war on one another at the battle fronts this is a classic spider and the fly story but here there's one lone fly and a whole bunch of spiders br br geraldine page plays the head mistress of the school and she gives a characteristically sensational performance page was trained as a theater actress and it shows in all of her performances no matter what role she played she always committed herself 100 to it and never once let herself drop out of character so it is here with this lethal spinster who takes her sexual repression out on this helpless man each of the other girls responds to him in her own particular way as well the two most prominent are the slutty girl who can't wait to throw throw herself at him and the virginal one played by who else but the mannered elizabeth hartman who acts like she would fall over in a dead faint if someone so much as said the word penis to her the schematic madonna and the whore storyline would seem heavy handed if the movie didn't keep you so off kilter and so completely unsure of what was going to happen next br br the most memorable scene in the film for me occurred when the group of women perform an amputation of eastwood's leg which has become infected with gangrene again the spider fly allusion is clear they hobble him so that it's that much harder for him to escape their web br br a classic chiller not a great film but a morbidly entertaining one br br grade a
<START> don't kill me fans but i have something to say about this br br pros well the most mildly interesting season that i've watched out of all the seasons that are out there of inuyasha just has tobe the arc unlike the rest of the seasons i personally think that this one has more of a real plot line and those mercenaries good god they're such likable characters shame they were killed off of course i would write a 15 page essay one why i like the so much but that would be boring for some of you so this series actually does have some likable characters i'll miss poor poor psycho little boy br br cons outside of arc the series was overall boring repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating for example she overreacts too much to my taste she acts like from elfen lied inuyasha he's a loud mouth dog demon with a huge sword what's so unique about him he has adorable dog ears tch is all talk no action and very cocky has just got to be the wimpiest villain that ever existed in the anime world and they have some color but they just seem to stand on the sidelines too much but what bugs me the most if the fact that they have absolutely no common sense at all rumiko takahashi has done a lot better then this i've seen it before br br if you like series with a lot of action no annoying love triangle no over repetitiveness this is not for you then
<START> this remake is entitled that darn cat but d c the cat is more of a sideline than the major character patti randall was not likable at all in this remake either she reminded me of one of those high school goth jerks you read about who have been angry since the day they were born so they end up opening fire on the rest of the school one day the federal cop kelso was okay but not as good as the one in the original i guess disney was trying to make christina ricci and doug doug or whatever goofy name he has into stars but they don't hold a candle to hayley mills and dean jones in the original i'm an animal lover and a cat lover and i don't blame d c for the remake being so much more inferior to the original movie after all they nearly cut him out of the whole movie all in all a very poor remake
<START> aliens let lose a giant monster named then send down a hologram that looks your average stupid teenage girl to tell postman tommy ward rhys pugh in the only movie you ever see him in that has been chosen to fight also if he loses the plant goes doom so he goes off to fight the invader this movie is bad very bad so bad it you need negative numbers just to gave it a horridly written bad directing way below power rangers over the top wooden acting that you're just whiting for a horde of to come out of no where and cut them down and don't get me started on the theme song at the end the people who made this stemming pall of s should not be aloud near a camera or any thing to do with films is a cool looking monster that should have been in a movie a million times better than this one do your self a favour and don't see this movie it's 80 or so minute of life the actors that are in this never worked again by way br br 3 10
<START> a blaxploitation classic this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the toasts that rudy ray moore performs toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and deliver a point and you can see how they would naturally evolve into rap for more on toasts rudy ray moore and why this movie is important go to dolemite com br br which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself this movie packs in a great deal of laugh at the funny outfits and hairstyles bang for the buck as nearly every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue it starts as dolemite is being released from prison in order to find out who framed him and bring him to justice i was unaware that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence but that's me i'm a neophyte in the prison scene he is helped in this by queen bee who is dolemite's lead prostitute and has been running his brothel while he's been gone she has also put all of his prostitutes through karate school so now he has an army of female karate fighters br br i watched this movie in two parts which is usually a mistake but in this case it provided an interesting contrast the first part i watched on my lunch break while exercising and wasn't enjoying it much at all it struck me as particularly poorly made blaxploitation with a ludicrous story shoddy i guess that makes it sound like it had some tons of outrageous locales outfits and dialogue but i wasn't enjoying fact it kind of made me feel dirty let's face it a white guy watching something like this to laugh at the outfits and the things the characters say is essentially getting an enjoyment out of it that is racist how ridiculously those black people dress what silly things they say i wasn't really enjoying it wasn't laughing and wasn't looking forward to watching the rest br br later that night when i was in a much more relaxed state i watched the legitimately loved it like disco godfather which i had watched a few days previously this has a warmth and sweetness at its core that makes it likable even when it's silly or violent the character of dolemite has an element of self parody about him that makes the whole thing fun and the appearance of several actors who were also in disco godfather implies that we're watching the group effort of a bunch of friends who just want to make something fun together even the poor dubbing karate fights and everything else just makes it that much more charming br br what i find interesting about the dolemite films is that they have some moral ambiguity i don't see in other blaxploitation films and certainly in very few mainstream films in this one there is an african american woman who gives a speech about the white mayor saying he has done more for the black community than anyone we later find out that the mayor is surprise corrupt but i like that the movie would present this woman as essentially misguided and not try to redeem her in some other way there's also the figure of the hamburger pimp who is presented as a useless junkie and no one makes an effort to find some redeeming socially positive angle to what he is he just is in disco godfather the religious character lady reed plays is presented as just nuts for wanting to pray for her child hopelessly lost to angel dust i like that the films would present such harshly critical portrayals of people in their own community without sugar coating or trying to redeem them to make them more palatable br br there are a lot of elements such as when dolemite says move over and let me pass or i'm gonna be pulling these hush puppies out your a there is queen bee reaching over and answering the phone dolemite's total experience and you will not be able to miss though you may wish to cover your eyes the extended nude scene by the repulsive mayor i am all for mustachioed pervy older men but even i have and my limits are usually a few miles past most people's so be warned the dvd i had is clearly edited which is noticeable in certain of the dialogue scenes and at the end when dolemite's killing of a major character with his bare hands obviously excludes the main event br br if you do get the dvd however be sure to watch all three trailers for the dolemite films as they are a hoot i wasn't going to watch the human tornado but after seeing that trailer you'd better believe that i am also there is a scene in the dolemite trailer that i don't remember from the movie when dolemite swings at a mexican looking thug obviously misses and the guy flips himself into a nearby car trunk br br after watching the first half i was going to say to skip this and watch disco godfather as the film making and story has marginally improved but after really enjoying the second half i would advise watching this one over disco godfather as this one is even more fun outrageous and good has those toasts which even if one doesn't understand the roots and nuances of the form are still something to see br br check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies cinema de merde cinemademerde com
<START> as if the world hadn't already got enough cheap jaws imitations writer boaz davidson decided to make the sequel to his ropey but reasonably enjoyable creature feature octopus a complete rip off of spielberg's classic right down to having a concerned cop who no one believes and a mayor more worried about his 4th july celebrations than people's lives br br even in the hands of an extremely skilled director it is unlikely that this derivative rubbish could have been anything other than hokey b movie garbage but with yossi yes the yossi calling the shots behind the camera a man with a fraction of mr spielberg's talent i estimate about 1 octopus 2 is guaranteed to be every bit as bad as one might imagine br br the predictable and extremely clichÃ©d plot isn't worth describing in much detail substitute island with new york and bruce the shark with a giant rubber octopus and you'll get the gist although several points about the film are definitely worth mentioning simply because they are so funny all of the octopus attacks involve the actors struggling to make incredibly fake looking giant tentacles look real which is hilarious to behold capital sofia unconvincingly stands in for new york and overuse of stock footage makes the illusion even less convincing best of all a silly dream sequence that sees the rubber octopus attacking our hero atop the statue of liberty is not only gut stupid but also features some truly dreadful special effects br br davidson's script also doesn't know when to quit there are several points in this film at which it could've and probably should've ended but the action goes on and on with the octopus surviving several explosions and causing a tunnel to collapse trapping the film's love interest and a bunch of kids before finally being blown to smithereens by the hero br br sometimes very silly always awful technically but never actually scary this stv stinker may find fans amongst those who actively seek out cinematic trash most normal people however would be advised to steer well clear
<START> as an ex merchant seaman i was really interested in this movie i personally have been involved in a stowaway search on leaving where one person was found we managed to get him ashore though as we were in territorial limits on another ship i was on the stowaway was found and we could not land him anywhere due to passport nationality issues in fact he stayed on for a year as an almost honorary crew member and worked for his keep africa is notorious for stowaway pickups there is a great scene in the beginning of the film when the bulk carrier enters the african port her size dwarfing all the crew pop ashore for a little intercourse and inebriation so far normal the drama starts when the enter the vast cavernous holds of the ship joss ackland is brilliant as the captain with a drink problem being harassed by his nemesis suchet right on form as the companys representative on board the stowaway search is classic but we did not have guns i question the use of guns in this film this ship seemed to have a vast armoury in my experience guns at sea are severely restricted due to customs regulations also having a dog on board was odd anti rabies laws especially in europe restrict carrying of animal severely anyway pertwee is brilliant as the embittered mate the horror which follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable the grim metallic background of the ships holds and a feeling that there is no where to hide adds to the drama some of the crew are not into the murder and those who get involved are gradually sucked in to a world of violence from which there is no escape the chase through the ship especially the engine room scenes are edge on the seat the feeling of extreme claustrophobia abounds the feeling of metal pressing in and death being only a gun barrel away the film is brutal my girlfriend had to give up watching it during the shooting and beating scenes while this goes on suchet in the comfort of his well appointed cabin gets drunk unaware of the mayhem 3 decks below its a tense film flawed in parts but the real message is that we can all get sucked into violence like this slowly and surely think of the train drivers who took jews to auschwitz the clerks who worked out those train timetable i always remember someone who had visited dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and he said that one of the s s guards had put a bird table outside the camp crematorium this film is like that ordinary people suddenly finding themselves in a world of unstoppable violence
<START> this movie was good relatively during the first parts of it br br we have a story from 3 points of view so let's find some clues and complete the story br br oh wait none of that stuff matters because the fbi guys are the bad guys though that was a great twist it was almost a terrible twist i immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10 15 minutes of it br br does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad yes it's a good shock but it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hour and twenty minutes there's no connection to the killers br br the killers are in about all of 5 minutes of this movie as killers and the two fbi agents are only in 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty br br we get it surveillance oh the killers are voyeurs which makes no sense because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths and the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the 3 stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in 5 minutes br br all of this makes the ending even more ridiculous oh they killed a bunch of fbi agents in the beginning what fbi agents sleep together all in the same room to be found and murdered by amateurs and then impersonated by people who know nothing about being fbi agents a cop 3 feet away apparently can't hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots i hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believe br br the other thing is the movie ends about 10 15 minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere
