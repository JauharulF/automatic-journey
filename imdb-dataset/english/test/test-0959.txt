<START> well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didn't see any humor he doesn't even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalo but i didn't think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesn't make the story funny br br back in the 1950s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesn't want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies what's so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox die hard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldn't wear it and vice versa br br maybe to someone who doesn't follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to him but it's a fact of life or any bit time sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laugh br br the art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltin's animation favorites from the national film board of canada
<START> this film broke a lot of ground and receives on the whole a lot less credit than it's due it touches on a topic that is ever present in our daily lives but which is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not merit discussion this phenomenon is that of be they doctors or as in broken promise a senior social worker who abuse their position in order to harm those they have been charged to protect br br in broken promise patty and her family are abandoned by their parents but are soon picked up by local law enforcement faced with the certain prospect of foster care patty begs a young social worker to keep her and her brothers and sisters together this social worker approaches a senior member of another department but his request is denied br br the children are off to seperate homes thereby following the prevailing opinions of the day and ensuring a clean break but it is this event the broken promise which gives the film it's name which causes the dramatic tension that is to continue throughout the film angered by the young social worker's apparent betrayal patty runs away from the foster home she has been sent to br br faced with the daunting task of finding her family in a climate where the ideal is seen to be a complete separation from the past she does the only the thing she can to ascertain their whereabouts and breaks into the senior social worker's office to steal the br br apprehended soon after she finds she has made a dangerous enemy furious at the embarrassment this little girl has caused him and his department the senior social worker decides to use his power and authority to destroy her something that legally he is quite capable of doing br br br br this topic of the harm of to clients is relatively taboo it certainly has been touched on very little in films as few directors wish to tread the path that would imply that cause harm br br i think that this film plays a very important role in making the public more aware of this sort of thing the case portrayed is not only plausible but has probably happened many times before to many other children all over the world this film is critical to changing public opinion in order to get rid of the laws that protect harmful people like the senior social worker in broken promise br br i strongly recommend broken promise it is especially appropriate viewing for trainee social workers psychiatrists psychologists doctors and other professions it is a lesson in avoidance that should be taken to heart br br br br in terms of the acting in broken promise melissa plays a superb part as patty especially in films such as this believability is critical if the viewer did not identify with the character of patty the whole message of the film would be in jeopardy it's unfortunate that melissa doesn't still act in films today as her performance in broken promise shows her to have had exceptional talent
<START> the warmest most engaging movie of its genre those lips those eyes made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work it takes to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment hulce and langella are superb and the story seems to write itself a brilliant screenplay by david one of my favorites see the warriors and for more and beautiful sets filmed on location i think at the actual summer theater in which the story takes place you can't see this movie and not want to drop everything and get into the theater please check this video out if you can find it
<START> i have been watching king of queens from the beginning and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows this show has the best humor you can identify with the characters we talk about it at work a lot because i work at a company a lot like ips dhl and we just love the plugs carrie is my hero she is the best she just puts it out there no matter what the subject is arthur well what can you say he just cracks you up and really puts a spin on things doug well he is just so lovable and funny the three characters plus all the friends just make the show complete this is the best comedy on tv i would say up there with seinfeld and hey there's nothing wrong with that excellente as doug would say
<START> i was lucky enough for this film to come on tcm so i had the opportunity to see it it's rather hard to find despite it being a hitchcock classic unfortunately it also has its shortcomings some of which hitchcock has repeated later first off the ending is a little too neat and perfect in the last few scenes until the last five minutes there is an astounding amount of tension then the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up very unsatisfying the ending is also overly dramatic for a hitchcock film he is was and always will be the master of suspense why would he stoop to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the ending apart from the few shortcomings the film is great the plot is excellent one of the best and most universal ever the theme simple you meet a stranger a perfect stranger he offers to kill someone for you you know you have someone you want if nothing else subconsciously dead the catch he asks you to do the same for him will you accept this bizarre yet ingenious arrangement you're clear of suspicion and so is he after all neither of you knew the victim and you don't know each other either you're just on a train' brilliant concept and one that just about every single person can relate to the pacing is good you never lose interest or patience the cinematography is good but not nearly as good as it is in other better hitchcock films the acting is flawless the characters are well written credible and realistic hitchcock uses some of the same elements that he often uses the dominating mother the mothers boy etc the film is very good but it just feels a little watered down it didn't go that famous extra mile that would have made it great it stopped before crossing the line between what's common and what's daring that is the primary reason for the film failing to be great but mainly remains good with potential to be more than that the end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed however everything leading up to the end is very good so the film still gets a deserving 8 10 good but not great any fan of hitchcock should see it as it is among his best somewhat far down on the list but still there i recommend it to any fan of hitchcock 8 10
<START> after a string of successful 'a man and his monkey films' which included the seminal every which way but loose every which way you can and peter's friends the genre fell on hard times in an effort to rejuvenate this once celebrated area director frank marshall brought michael crichton's acclaimed novel to the big screen br br think in the meets minus the box office clout of bruce this is one mans doomed love affair for his talking monkey not helped by bad accents tim curry struggles with a romanian a baboon of a screenplay hungry hippos primates and bruce campbell ape sh t
<START> wow i haven't seen a movie this bad since fire down below wait that's a seagal movie too like on deadly ground and fire down below seagal centers the movie around his environmental awareness message and how the military fbi and cia are incompetent idiots problem is that both reality and a sensible plot are secondary to whatever social commentary seagal is trying to get across
<START> growing up as of child of the movies one of the trilogies i shall not soon forget is that of the karate kid you can put down ralph daniel all you want but its the message behind the movies that are important that its important to be respectful to all creatures great and small but stand up for yourself when the time calls for it getting back to the movie at hand its rather funny because i saw boys don't cry and was really impressed with the performance of hillary swank and in flipping through the sea of channels the other night i came across the showing of this film and i hadn't realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it the story centers around julie just like daniel not knowing where to fit in or if she even wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help straighten her out and guide her i really liked this addition to the series as it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes even some outfits that hillary were in kept me shall we say stimulated br br overall 3 5 out of 5
<START> riders of destiny was the first of several westerns wayne made for the lone star arm of monogram pictures between 1933 and 1935 in this entry the producers try to make the duke into a singing cowboy called singin' sandy saunders with hilarious results any wayne fan knows that the duke couldn't have carried a tune if his life had depended on it his voice was apparently dubbed by smith whose deep baritone sounds nothing like wayne wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in performing the musical numbers thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon ended br br as for the movie itself it contains a standard b western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain forrest taylor and the local ranchers duke of course plays the hero he had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy br br also cast in the film were george pre gabby hayes as the heroine's father cecilia parker as the heroine and yakima canutt as one of the boys who performs his falling from the racing horses under the wagon stunt while doubling wayne both canutt and hayes would go on to appear with wayne in most of the other entries in the series canutt in particular would have a profound effect on wayne's future development teaching him among other things how to move fight and look comfortable on a horse br br as b westerns go this one isn't too bad however i have to give it a failing grade because of the singing
<START> i concur with what b has said the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content emotions aren't conveyed properly i guess a couple of not so good performances also contributed to its mediocrity in my view tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai in some of her scenes she looks a bit lusty which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed i also noticed a bit of over acting in some of her scenes i'm a bitter critic of aishwarya rai can't help it sorry for that was a good movie by and i saw choker bali after seeing raincoat i was not at all impressed
<START> in a word magical and so incredibly real vijay is so incredibly raw so incredibly vulnerable that you just want his characters to succeed in whatever he does and he plays hari om impeccably from his absolutely perfect bollywood e to his awkward shy manner with a first kiss he is a truly gifted actor and i wouldn't hesitate to see him in anything because he brings it all to life and gives it a soul camille is absolutely gorgeous it took some time for me to warm up to her possibly because she plays the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist so well her transition really became her and she molded into her role very well even the man you love to hate her boyfriend benoit was wonderful though you never really like him for the scum that he plays jean marie lamour enacts a perfect cad the script so real i found myself turning to my friend repeatedly throughout the film to say that's exactly what happens in india they nailed it very real very raw very bittersweet but you certainly leave the theater feeling fulfilled music by is wonderful and goes perfectly with the constantly changing moods but vijay i find myself constantly coming back to him because he is what makes this movie he is the hero the most charming disarming rickshaw driver you will ever encounter he's magical a lovely real sweet incredibly talented actor who i cannot wait to see shine and succeed in bollywood hollywood or anywhere
<START> as you know the greatest game ever played is about golf i used to snicker at the over dramatic title but through great visual display credited to director bill paxton better known for his acting in twister and hilarious supporting roles in aliens and true lies we find out that this has much more meaning than a game br br though the movie is about golf it seems as though the sport is just the framework for what is really going on what is really going on is a story of individuals being told they can't fulfill their dreams be it age or social status a conflict between a son's wishes and a father's demands an english golf legend looking to bring the title home with the country breathing down his neck br br shia labeouf even stevens plays francis a caddy with a god given talent who was never permitted to play golf in the first place despite the resentment of the upper class gentlemen it was undeniable that francis had a gift what posed a greater threat was the discouragement of his father played by elias koteas teenage mutant ninja turtles who felt that playing a mere game will never improve their poor living conditions with the continued support of his mother francis eventually comes face to face with his idol the golf legend harry stephen br br more impressive than the game itself was the movie's cinematic achievement this proved that storytelling is successful through pure cinema the entire movie could've been told without dialog there are scenes in the movie that build strong suspense and powerful emotion with only pictures in one particular scene francis swings and the entire crowd turn their heads to watch the ball fly into the distance all but the face of harry looking intensely at without a flinch the ways in which the golfers visualize the course offer more aesthetic enjoyment br br a pleasant supporting cast completes the whole peyton list plays the love interest and looks worth playing for and josh flitter plays a lovable caddy that keeps focused as the pressure bogs him down golf fan or not you'll appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great medium to tell any story
<START> this was so bad i want god to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through it br br first off the acting was uniformly bad there was barely a plot unless shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog counts br br the editing was was all over the place and the slow mo shots of the gore red corn syrup flying through the air doubtless flung using a spoon got irritating after the tenth time and infuriating after the hundredth time br br i like michael rooker he's done some good work this was not good this was less than good and by that i mean that it sucked hard br br for god's sake don't watch this movie
<START> the casting of robert culp is probably the only decent move the production team made with this film falk and culp were marvellous but as culp was not nemesis this time chemistry was lacking columbo is only as strong as his opposite number and this time he didn't have one
<START> a team varied between scully and mulder two other scientists a pilot and the guy who plays bana on seinfeld go up to an arctic research post where all members have died off by either killing each other or killing themselves they discover there's a worm a virus that is parasitic to the point of madness and death the problem is after a certain dog lashes out anyone could be infected but who this is not just my favorite episode of season 1 but also one of my favorites from the show the arctic environment the characters and of course like carpenter's the thing it's a lot of fun watching these even tempered characters suddenly start to flip out in dramatic scenes and the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy i didn't mind them at all the drama between the characters ends up working more than it would usually because of the tension and because all of the actors including the bana guy understand what's going on in the story and as usual i loved the ambiguity of the ending highly recommended
