<START> when this show first came to disney i love it started watching all the time it quickly became one of my favorite disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing br br i do now find any of the second and third season fun they seem like a re watch of some teens shows i hat that garbage the first season was very unique because it showed sadie who loved science and animals and creatures the first season was very entertaining i mostly don't like the second season because of ben he annoys me and pisses the crap outta me the plot in the second season also sucks and is just awful
<START> am a hardcore horror thriller fan when i was for good horror flick to scare me on my weekend night grabbed hatchet with impressing blood stained hatchet movie poster added to average ratings in imdb but i was wrong after watchin this crap no characterisation sick dialogues with sexy babes bared boobs i got the feel of watchin porno certainly and the which so called main theme or suspense of the story sucks big time and here comes the clown funny mask to scare think users rated this movie went nuts it deserves 1 out of 10 i give 2 for bare boobs babes n soundtrack it has
<START> this movie has some good lines but watching dillon's less than masterful rourke impersonation just left me wanting to see the original i like marisa tomei but she's no faye dunaway br br also in my opinion the number one movie rule is to make the lead character someone you care about you might not love the character but you should care what happens to him this is achieved in barfly with the hilarious running gag about the fights with eddie the bartender the main fight in factotum is when completely unprovoked he stalks up to the lily taylor character in a bar punches her to the floor and calls her a whore br br the whole thing just didn't work again some great lines some laugh out loud funny but as a movie overall it's a fail mediocre attempt at reinventing something that was brilliant and you can't get past that next let's remake breakfast at tiffany's with kate hudson
<START> i watched this on cable because i was a big leelee fan big mistake what a horrible film you don't care one bit for any of the characters in the movie chris klein plays a guy who is a complete jerk in the film and steals away josh hartnett's longtime girlfriend if the writer knew what they were doing this film would have followed the proven formula and made hartnett an ass and leelee as the girlfriend trapped in a bad relationship from which she's saved by klein but hartnett is a really cool guy who shows a lot of emotion and love for leelee br br you then hate leelee because she cheats on hartnett with klein who is a jerk to everyone in the town that's trying to help him and really stuck up br br it's also really campy and the characters do everything but run around the kitchen dancing and lip synching and using and spoons and fake microphones although they come very close br br what a horrible horrible movie you don't even care what happens in the end because the director never lets you care about the characters
<START> great movie great actors great soundtrack i loved it settings are perfect dialogues situations storyline all together mixed to give this masterpiece clooney and turturro are magnificent and the soggy bottom boys are simply charming and contagious with their music
<START> she's the man was everything i wanted it to be and maybe even a little more i love the teen type chick flick films and i knew this one would be great in the same vein as 10 things i hate about you one of my all time faves she's the man is a unique well written very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy i have seen in a long time it's probably the funniest movie i've seen this year with the exception of the hilarious pink panther but she's the man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script three's company style story of mistaken identities and mixed messages and the cast br br amanda bynes is a star even since the days of the horribly campy yet strangely entertaining the amanda show she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy she's probably one of the most talented comediennes out there her style of physical comedy impersonations and witty dialect makes her hilarious previously her big screen debut where she was the star was the rather hilarious and well made what a girl wants if that wasn't her break out vehicle than she's the man takes care of that hands down bynes is really the ultimate girl next door it's a shame she doesn't do more big screen work because she could be the next it girl she is the all american cute down to earth bubbly teen although she's twenty now and whether or not she'll be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen but for the purpose of this film she is perfect she actually legitimately pulls off the rather outlandish plot of her impersonating her twin brother and makes it believable not entirely but believable enough most of the script relies on the comedy of her errors trying to be a guy but it's just hilarious non stop laughs channing tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's havoc by plays duke he's the jock the captain of the soccer team and eventually bynes' object of affection unfortunately he's also sebastian's room mate who is bynes he's a good leading man and the chemistry is perfect between them laura ramsey is olivia who happens to be attracted to sebastian who again is bynes she does good as well although her part is small and she doesn't really effect the rest of the cast one way or another james kirk is great in his small role as the real sebastian his resemblance to amanda bynes is astonishing they are absolutely believable as twins and further more from a distance you could understand someone believing bynes is sebastian the rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supporting but essentially they are all supporting the story between bynes and tatum but everyone is more or less supporting bynes terrific performance she easily carries the film with no and makes it worth while br br this is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet it's not one of those films that when that part comes up it's not funny anymore the parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film relative newcomer director andy fickman does such an incredible job on this film he weaves together a potentially complicated storyline and makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall together the story which is loosely based off of shakespeares twelfth night but it's remarkable how much they managed to translate over to this modern day film it's seemingly completely off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than you'd think there isn't too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drags a little and also becomes a might predictable but it doesn't change the hilarity of the first half of the film nonetheless you'll be laughing to tears and it's one of the funniest films in the theater right now hands down 9 10
<START> i actually liked certain things about this game i loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games there's nothing like seeing the monsters up close in your face the graphics really weren't bad but i would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter the music was fine the things i hated were the movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain the story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality the inability to save was awful some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later i thought the weapons kind of sucked too this game is fun for awhile but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff i'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person but that's about it play it at your own risk
<START> 'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichÃ©d dialogue rehashed plot and over the top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large scale combat once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil war era cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and renÃ©e zellweger is such a film br br then again calling cold mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate true enough the film opens with a quite literally quick and dirty battle sequence that puts glory director edward zwick shame however cold mountain is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier played by jude law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind ada monroe played by nicole kidman at first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived br br cold mountain soon takes a drastic turn though as the intrepid hero turns out to be a deserter incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates and begins a long odyssey homeward meanwhile back at the farm ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of a coming to ada's rescue is the course tough as nails ruby played by renÃ©e zellweger who helps ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada br br within these two settings a vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the war torn south unfolds the characters with whom and ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father ray winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother all have been greatly affected and changed by the war of northern aggression mostly for the worse the dark pervading anti war message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century it's hellish effect on the land is relevant br br director anthony manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters the love story between and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot br br make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of a feel good romance nor an inspiring war drama it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether
<START> meltdown opens on a scene of scientists preparing to conduct an important test on a missile system developed to deflect asteroids should they be on a collision course with earth nathan vincent gale mentions some misgivings to his but the test appears to be an unqualified success then the asteroid breaks apart and the largest piece is pushed into a direct collision path with earth fortunately the huge rock skips off of earth's outer atmosphere and into space unfortunately the glancing blow is just enough to alter earth's orbit and the planet begins to spiral closer to the sun br br while all of this is going on above their heads los angeles cops tom casper van dien and mick greg anderson are on a stake out they're supposed to collect evidence against a suspected drug dealer but the deal they're watching quickly devolves into a shooting match afterward tom takes a few minutes to be interviewed by a local television reporter who also happens to be his girlfriend carly stefanie von br br at a nearby hospital where mick is treated for a minor injury tom has a brief chat with his ex girlfriend bonnie venus who is a nurse he tells her he's concerned about the fact that their 17 year old daughter kimberly amanda crew is dating a man named cj ryan mcdonell once tom explains to bonnie that he's discovered cj has a criminal record she's a little worried herself br br it's not long however before everybody has something else to worry about the temperature is rapidly rising all around the world carly is one of the first non scientists to learn what's really happening nathan who is her brother calls her to say he may have a way that they can survive carly calls tom he of course promptly contacts bonnie br br in relatively short order the motley group is on the road before they can reach their ultimate goal however they've got to make their way through bands of looters deal with a catastrophic water shortage and manage to travel in temperatures that are high enough to kill br br casper van dien is a good looking guy and i actually enjoyed him in starship troopers that may be because he's good in action scenes it might also be because he didn't talk much in that movie in meltdown he's unfortunately given just enough lines in situations that are just dramatic enough to showcase his entirely average acting abilities amanda crew is also okay and ryan mcdonell isn't bad either vincent gale and stefanie von are also both reasonably good but venus is sadly on a par with van dien br br what really makes or breaks a movie though is the story and the script while the story here is okay and actually has some real potential the script is just awful the science part of the science fiction is non existent starting with the asteroid pushing the earth out of orbit and escalating with the notion that the gravitational balance of the solar system might pull the earth back into its usual orbit over time when the temperature in la hits 120 degrees cars start blowing up br br you know what's even worse than the bad science the bad continuity okay really hot why are people in the movie not only wearing long sleeved shirts but jackets too why are people mugging each other for bottled water instead of turning on the taps at home why are the streets completely empty but the freeways completely full and why are the freeways full of unexploded it's almost superfluous to note that the sets costumes and production values were good especially when that only forces me to say that the edits were not br br so basically you take a pretty good story idea and combine it with mostly mediocre acting a terrible script low end special effects utterly irrational plot twists and poor edits and what do you have a movie that's even less than the sum of its parts i'm sorry to say that i can't recommend meltdown days of destruction to anyone br br political notes there is mention here that congress finally loosened the purse strings enough to fund the tests that start the movie rolling while the tests here were wholly irresponsible targeting an asteroid with a nuke and not knowing the composition of the big rock is in fact well beyond irresponsible and approaching the insane the fact is that such scenarios are a very real danger to the planet unfortunately we've tracked nowhere near all of the near earth asteroids that could be worrisome in some orbit some day and our ability to spot something on a collision course with us is limited at best br br once we do discover we're going to be hit we quite literally have no system in place to deal with it there are no nuclear tipped space missiles we can launch the space shuttle is completely incapable of going beyond earth orbit and if it were we couldn't launch enough of them or launch them quickly enough for it to matter i'm not big on the government doing anything beyond its constitutional mandates but i certainly think protecting the planet from destruction coming at us from outer space could be construed as defending the country don't you family meltdown days of destruction is rated r for some violence i frankly didn't find the violence here anything beyond a fairly typical t rated video game if your teens are keen on seeing meltdown and you can't talk them out of it the r rating shouldn't dissuade you from letting them see it it's not however a good idea to leave the younger kids in the room with their elder siblings while the shootings aren't too graphic in the main some of the dead bodies are
<START> great fun for an evening on the sofa don't expect academy award stuff with this but it will leave you with a smile the performance by bruce spence is truly good the soundtrack shows off some great old australian talent check out this and other true aussie films
<START> i have not read a time to kill by john grisham and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better but perhaps not i hear this is the most faithful grisham adaption yet and if that is true i can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when grisham introduced it as his first work br br a time to kill is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once it wants to be a suspenseful crowd pleasing thriller and at the same time a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions let's face it those two types of films do not go together in hollywood which is why dead man walking had to be made independently br br the story involves a young lawyer named jake matthew out to defend a black man named carl samuel l jackson from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter the day before the trial carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building he charged out and shot both of them dead to help out with the defense jack accepts the help of a former law student sandra bullock who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary and put in the film only for marketing purposes br br meanwhile one of the rapist's kid brother kiefer sutherland was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge all of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse a kidnapping a brutal beating and race riot i'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film in addition to the courtroom scenes what i later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot br br the main question that the film constantly asks over and over again is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury sure they can but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair this film however doesn't seem to think so besides that there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences for example there is an unknown character called mickey mouse who is a member of the klan and for reasons unknown is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the klan after bullock is kidnapped by sutherland and company and left for dead in the wilderness this unknown person comes and saves her and we never find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing br br and speaking of the sutherland character's reign of terror it's amazing how witless the police and the bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film there's a scene when sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot jake as he comes out shooting one of the guards instead now you'd think since there are dozens of police around it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper no such luck from what we could see no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose even after bullock was rescued by mickey mouse she never ever mentioned who her kidnapper was nor was it even questioned why was this simple the sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense although logically he should have been out of the picture br br besides bullock's character there another thankless character he is jake's assistant played by oliver platt there seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie to supply a number of one liners for the audience in my opinion one liners show a major weakness in serious films when used it demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film br br but enough of the film's many minor problems what about the film's message here it is clear that carl is indeed guilty of murder we saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter the lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity etc that caused him to kill in desperation jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing after describing everything that took place he adds on one final line the girl is white we then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes br br in the very next scene a girl comes out yelling he's free he's free wait a minute do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts most of all why weren't there any scenes that showed the jury and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off i'll tell you why they couldn't show the because no jury could acquit a man of such a crime no matter how much the closing touched their hearts what is the message that someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them br br this film should have had the courage to say that murder is not ok in this situation because in reality there would not be an acquittal but since dollars were at stake the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences' feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message if people start killing as a form of revenge the makers of this film should be held responsible what a socially irresponsible film this is
<START> although this film looks like a crime thriller noir the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few surprise twists or turns at all and those that do appear are not exactly shockers br br however if you slip out of action thriller' mode and into entertainment ' then this is really quite a fun movie with several hilarious moments most of these can be attributed to the witty dialogue between alan rickman and emma thompson's characters but that said sadie said it all in her hilarious opening greeting to friedman and it left very little else for anything else to develop between these two characters i didn't find these esteemed british actors version of the southern accents that bad ok thompson sounded like she was rolling marbles in her mouth as she tried to spoke southern but rickman was surprisingly rather good with very few minor lapses into his customary english accent if you want to critique accents lets discuss that of coco she only spoke southern periodically br br
<START> the king is alive is a flawed and contrived mess of a movie which comes off like a self indulgent auteur's excuse to transport a bunch of actors to a godforsaken desert where he can play major dogme and film his selfishly conceived silly overwrought drama with utter disregard for the real forces of human nature market appeal common sense and even good art in other words this is one flick and if you don't believe that your penance is watching it only for critics and the like d
<START> i think this is pauly shore's best stuff he played the part perfect i really enjoyed this movie patrick is really funny as zack the annoying little brother son in law is a good comedy worth your time but the only thing i wish tiffany thiessen was the farm chick instead of the one they had
<START> a nicely paced romantic war story that should have got more exposure the czech pilot who played piano gives a mellow touch to the story the flying footage may not have been enough for aviation buffs like myself but then again this really isn't an action movie though it does not have anything in common with the james novel the hunters that became the movie about korean war sabre pilots dark blue world had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it better in some ways than battle of britain in that it doesn't rely on big name actors suggest viewing this movie with some czech beer and some czech called sp
