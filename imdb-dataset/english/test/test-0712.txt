<START> jack frost returns with an army of styrofoam balls that can only be foiled by being shot with super loaded with margaritas how's that for a plot the film hinges on such a ridiculous premise that it barely raises an eyebrow when characters are killed with bbq tongs and are impaled by carrots you might even say the whole movie is skating on thin ice ba boom tish br br admittedly there are some fantastic one liners including a remark about the murderous coconut shark br br fair enough times are hard but that does not excuse the willingness of the actors to take part in such utter tripe br br for those fans hoping to see jack frost be prepared to accept him as merely a phallic carrot creeping up the beach with corny voice over commentary
<START> i absolutely adore this movie i had never heard of it when i saw it at the video store i saw kathy bates was in it so i figured it had to have some worth you know i watched it the first time just shaking my head huh then it was the last scene and i found myself aching from smiling so hard i clicked play movie and watched the whole thing again it is without doubt the quirkiest movie i've ever seen but the more i watch it the more i love it it's absurd and crazy and sweet and dear kathy bates is impeccable but the rest of the cast is fabulous too what odd characters they all are the midget is just too funny for words and julie andrews and barry manilow are hysterical it's just an all around funny fabulous movie i get cravings to see it again whoever is watching it for the first time please stick it out to the end it's well worth it
<START> i have nothing but good things to say about this tasteful and heartwarming film i think that the effort of the film's director writer is courageous as well as inspirational i loved this film not only for the fantastic story which needed to be told but also for the way the actors delivered the story this is not another shallow gay movie that depicts stereotypical characters in humorous situations this was a memorable and flawless effort to show people that love truly knows no bounds and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was br br another thing that touched my heart was how well i could relate to the emotion portrayed in this film surrounding the coming out of one of the main characters we all have to go through similar situations living in the society that we live in and feeling that feeling of detachment from everything that is right and normal i give my most heartfelt praise for this fabulous and courageous story
<START> fascinating and amusingly bad lights of new york is the first all talkie feature and one that almost never saw the light of day br br two naive barbers eddie and gene from out of town get involved with bootleggers and end up a speak when a cop is shot by one of the bootleggers the police start to close in and the hawk who shot the officer decides to pin the murder on eddie instructing his henchman to take him for a ride but it's the hawk himself who takes the bullet in a twist that will surprise few br br shot in one week at a cost of 23 000 lights was originally meant as a two reeler but foy took advantage of jack warner's absence to extend it to six when warner discovered this he ordered foy to cut it back to the original short only when an independent offered for the film did warners actually look at the film which went on to make a staggering 1 3 million br br seen now this is an extremely hokey piece with acting that ranges from the passable eugene pallette to trance like eddie's granny in a particularly risible scene and much of the playing is at the level of vaudeville since it's an early talkie 4 part talkies preceded it that's about all the characters do and very slowly at that the script feels improvised visual style is non existent apart from the shooting scene done in silhouette and scenes grind on interminably title cards are intercut which redundantly announce characters and locales br br despite all this lights is a compelling experience as we watch actors and crew struggling with the alien technology and changing cinema for ever br br catch it if you can
<START> gosh i am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view primarily because in 20 years you learn more for example i had no idea who george cukor was how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly all i can say is i really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life lifelong friendship between two women can that ever exist well in certain doses yes and this film let out in a bit on how br br being a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time i saw this so i focused more on the rich and famous part between the two at the time i had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there was and how that would effect their friendship through their men their career the decades that defined them and coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything else their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could have br br then i got older studied film a bit and watched this film again with my best friend from high school we do understand the and angle and we are still the best of friends but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece it can be seen as a bit campy at times a little over the top at points kinda on a and level to me and honestly i can identify with the teddy bear scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men careers et al so its not as over the top as it seems as many already said seeing meg ryan and matt and rambo and david selby are great in this 1981 piece this is a nice chick flick
<START> my family truly enjoyed this movie as far as what this movie will do for rugby in the usa well i am sure that will be debatable but as for me and others around me i know that we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and i personally gained more respect for the game you may wonder how this possible especially since the movie does not dive in and explain rugby but the simple fact is it drew you into the players and emotion of the game and life the film was inspirational as well as entertaining it made us laugh and cry the chemistry between sean astin big budah and sean faris worked well some may think the movie is a little clichÃ© but i seriously wish hollywood made more movies like this i couldn't help drawing analogies of the game and life's struggles at the end of it i found myself examining my own life to see what i needed to do better in order to be the best person i could be honestly i was grateful this movie taught morals values and teamwork there is so much to the contrary after watching this i really hope my kids are coached by someone who has a philosophy like coach
<START> obviously someone was looking at catching onto the blair witch wave br br this movie was set up like all the reality haunted shows that are popping up on tv lately and i must admit i get a kick out of these but this movie is much cheesier probably the first three quarters of the movie is filled with the participants going through the house whining give me a break spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time any paranormal happenings are blatant setups no strings but too perfectly caught on camera to be real the participants were not very likeable either two goofy guys who don't take it seriously one girl who scares at the drop of a hat and the quintessential over played paranormal person is this becoming the clichÃ©d formula for a ghost movie br br i have to admit the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension they took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes i admit i spent that time pacing in the kitchen i really wouldn't recommend this movie to younger viewers even if it is pg13 br br if you're looking for some entertainment if you don't take it seriously you will get a kick out of this movie there's tons of situations to make cracks about if you're looking for an great story line look elsewhere
<START> cave dwellers or the blade mater or whatever it's called is in one word vile i saw this on mst and i laughed not only at the great running commentary but at the inept film making that was demonstrated sunglasses tire tracks and where did ator get a hang glider then they lift a few shots from another movie where eagles dare as tom servo points out to show just how cheap this movie really is watch the scene where ator and thong have to battle invisible swordsmen or even better look for the giant hose dressed up like a snake that ator must wrestle and what exactly do those scenes in the credits have to do with the movie
<START> without a doubt one of tobe best epic great special effects and the vamp me baby
<START> it's tempting to view this film as a daring avant garde experiment i like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that was completely utterly entirely unfunny br br the answer to judge by from venus is a resounding 'yes' this may not be the worst film i've ever seen but my brain seems to have repressed all memory of the others this horrible flick hovers just on the borderline bad enough that the thought still causes pain but not quite so bad that my internal censors have obliterated it from my consciousness br br it's difficult for me to imagine what the director and the cast thought they were doing when they made this or why they went ahead and released it once they'd made it i doubt anyone involved with it earned very much but surely between them they could have got together enough money to buy up all the prints and have them burned br br this is a movie that has nothing whatsoever to recommend it it's not even enjoyably bad it's just a non movie in which nothing interesting happens i gave serious thought to taking it back and demanding my money back which is not something i've ever done before br br don't even think about renting much less buying this horrible non movie
<START> ghoulies 4 is pretty ghoulish sequel the ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies but there still cool there are some nice flash backs from ghoulies the first movie jonathan is back once again in this one he wasn't in parts 2 or 3 though the movie is low budget at times but fun to watch you've got tony cox as the dark ghoulie and arturo gil as the light ghoulie the ghoulies in this movie are actually good guys instead of evil like in the first three movies both ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie then you've got the very hot alexandra it's a great dark comedy and funny any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching ghoulies 4 the dvd is finally coming out this july 2007 hopefully one day ghoulies iii will be on dvd in the usa i'd really like to see a sequel to this movie one day too i doubt it will happen though it's 2007 now and no sign of a sequel yet if there ever is a sequel i hope jim wynorski will make it br br i give ghoulies iv a 9 10
<START> after recently seeing cry uncle by the same director i decided to seek this out and am i glad i did this is an extraordinarily good film far far better than it would seem likely given the ingredients how many times have we had to suffer the embarrassment of someone playing a middle class dad mixing it with the flower children and yet here thanks to a perfect script it is made believable not ideal not good or bad but believable peter boyle as the working class hippie and ni er hater and dennis patrick as the uptight suit play their respective parts immaculately and i can't remember ever seeing the two classes getting together like this without things getting sentimental susan sarandon is effective as a hippie chick but doesn't have all that much to do in her first film this is a truly must see film capturing as it does that very short period in western and in particular us times when the counter culture was about to bust itself wide open
<START> contains spoilers br br a lovely film this starring brad and the ever wonderful joseph i like joseph out of all his films i've seen to date i've loved every single one of them for many different reasons and the cure is no different brad does very well in this movie as well the cure is a drama coming of age movie from the viewpoint of an ill child and his friend br br the basic idea is dexter joseph has aids he ends up befriending the kid next door brad but erik's mum is very narrow minded ill informed and somewhat thick when it comes to dexter's illness she thinks aids is contagious like the common cold so doesn't want her son going anywhere near dexter br br after many attempts at making their own cure with no success the boys go on their way to new orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it after getting their kicks from playboy magazine dexter's health goes south shortly afterwards and as his health there's still enough life in the boy alongside erik for two pranks of pretending to stop breathing unfortunately poor dexter does indeed die from his illness leaving poor erik behind to wonder why he couldn't find the cure throughout the movie he ends up bonding more with dexter's mother than his own br br it is a very heartwarming movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect movies rarely are but you won't care less about that as you get involved in the film more a must for joseph fans one of his best performances ever very well recommended must see movie if you can find a copy
<START> i can remember seeing this movie when i was very young and several times on tv since then i have always liked it i have noticed on the print shown on local tv that one scene has reversed film it is the one where they are hiding behind the rock outcrop it looks like vasquez rocks near los angeles watching the indians ride by if you look carefully you will notice that suddenly all the soldiers are left handed it is only a short segment and i have to admit that it took me years to notice it br br as far as history goes there were often to rescue white captives from the indians the direct connection for the final battle scene is the battle of island in that action a group of volunteer scouts equipped with repeating carbines spencer carbines not were surprised by the indians and retreated to an island and held off several charges in the last charge they killed roman nose one of the more famous indian chiefs i have no idea if the writer of the script had this in mind but it does fit fairly well br br there are several guy madison movies that i hope come out on dvd someday and this is one of them
<START> there are subtleties in this film that i think a lot of people may miss if they're not careful you really need to follow what leland says and read his character to figure out the intended why the movie presents at the end nothing it solid it's not definite it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it i think that was the plan from the get go people aren't meant to all understand it in the same way it's almost about forming your own personal relationship with leland in order to maybe feel him a little better br br the storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is it's dramatic and thought provoking a lot of heavy ideas but the pace of the movie is almost soothing even with its more intense scenes with yelling i think it's probably leland he's just calm and almost serene even for all of his sadness the movie personifies leland in a way br br of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it but there are some recycled ideas i mean leland has a lot of impressive dialogue he is anything but typical but he's not a prophet everything he says is not a revelation many people i know have mentioned things he mentioned even i have observed a few things he's observed leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for ryan portrayal br br in the end the acting is all exceptional there are no real bad guys there is no way to psychologically evaluate leland only to maybe understand him and life a little better br br comparable to goes down i think not comedic but similar in its general outlook on life
