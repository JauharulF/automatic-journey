<START> a horror picture set ultimately to parody but still in it's play out could scare a few of those that are or easily disgusted when they see whats under their skin i laughed at it though it was easy to decipher the true killer and his acting didn't help this only led to potente looking even better anatomie is not much of a horror picture for those foreign of the genre but those contained should get a few unintentional laughs and an interesting peak at german horror cinema 6 10
<START> was a show that used to be on during the last hour or so before it was time to sleep about ten or so years ago it was a contrast to a lot of the kid type of animation i was watching at the time i was still a minor junkie for disney and looney tunes stuff and most saturday morning cartoons were still on the run off of the peak from the days of ninja turtles and batman but also around this time i began to recognize that the more raunchy mature surreal obscene and though i didn't know the term at the time satirical cartoon shows were more creative than the stuff i was used to around the time of beavis and butt head ren and stimpy and even the maxx were hitting tv sets via mtv usa put out two shows one of them was weird science and the other was i've always remembered a few key bits from the show and some of the lines are very quotable to those who haven't forgotten it completely luckily i found a tape recently with about six episodes i taped long ago and the jokes stayed very fresh and the delivery of the jokes are rapid fire a lot of the time in the better episodes br br in the voice department the choices in talent are top notch for the story lines which are usually just an excuse for crude fascinating parodies of pop culture politics movies and tv shows music detective mysteries and the dysfunctional family unit jason alexander is a wonderful choice for and his performance is a comedic 180 from his days on seinfeld even if there might be some similar characteristics here and there also the voices of gregg berger as the unmistakably monotoned and deadpan dweezil zappa as the hilariously inept ajax and nancy travis as the sex starved obnoxious sister in law bernice all contribute in a full amount along with some great writing even when a joke isn't sure fire the wit behind it compensates the animation style while a far cry from some of the computer enhanced product of today is inventive and often abstract it has that home made gritty quality that beavis and butt head or south park would later have and like those shows if you're a little kid i mean little as in younger than i was watching the show you may not understand most of the jokes i e there are enough stripper and vd references to fill two shows sometimes but it's inventive to catch if it's on tv late at night and it functions rather well in that time slot one can only hope for a dvd box set br br so to no one who's barely or even never heard of this program here's a general note think of this show as if dashiell hammett met up with walt disney and decided to go to slum part of vegas with a free mini bar and make a collaboration in the vein of luis bunuel and the simpsons combined not to mention it's by the group that did rugrats strong a
<START> so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly and i wanted to see how the new government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives behind each one the reasons behind decision to give the its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the fight for freedom saw a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so it's all the sadder because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the reason the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentence long statements and facts printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer point blank the main idea of what's going on completely over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things for instance there is the scene when is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with one that vilifies and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying orders there are three soldiers that speak in the scene uttering lines that show their points of view then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and that's that there's little telling through actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness it's hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact we never learn what these factions are what they're fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are one dimensional and flat unfortunately i don't know whether was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didn't trust it to tell me so the like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations fails to give proper attention to these details and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines
<START> in a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously and move into 'adult' films mr hughes gives us this film about a young married couple true it's got every cliche in the book in it silly fantasy stuff and all that but more importantly it's got elizabeth mcgovern br br clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a john hughes film she lends a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material kevin bacon and his hair is pretty good as her husband but mcgovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty the 'teen film' fun that worked so well in other hughes films falls flat here like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9 but keeps telling them when you are 15 and you wish he'd find some new material but i keep going back to performance because it's truly moving mr hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them some kind of wonderful breakfast club and when his material bumps up against a true talent some wonderful things can happen if only he'd trust that it doesn't have to be tarted up with the silly fantasy stuff
<START> terence stamp can carry off anything but this is still a shallow one dimensional movie it's nice to look at so are the actors and if you're into drag queens i guess you might like it a lot but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard it's one of those politically correct movies that warps everything else in order to make a 'minority seem warm and cuddly it gets a lot of mileage out of bitchy dialogue which is amusing in this sanitized form i guess br br ninety percent of the action is parading around in gaudy costumes in incongruous situations the dramatic content is a token appendage they hardly try to get you to take it seriously
<START> hollywood has turned the mafia in to a production line of output ranging from the banal to the excellent and despite some good acting and a reasonable script much of which is for a change true this home entertainment effort has to fall slap bang in the middle br br the script is not only obvious all of the checklist boxes end up being ticked but spends a lot of time trying to create a pastiche of the best of other people's work the godfather being the most obvious but there are other references too i won't bother naming them nevertheless it is a good taste borrower the producer seems to set a quota for gunshots and murder one at least every twenty minutes and the ending is weak and so what i am told there are various versions of this production so that maybe that is just the version i have seen br br gangsters don't make money they take money usually by fear some seem more in to the murder and mayhem side of the business than making money they were the ones that were the first to go in real life and here you can't make money with a gun in your hand says charlie 'lucky' luciano at one stage one of the smarter gangsters although all things are relative he was a skilled white slave trader and a drug dealer before being bundled home to italy br br the old school pete's were picked off by the new bloods who wanted the power and the money for themselves and to break free of the straight jacket of italian sicilian power rarely doing business outside themselves the young knew they needed to be allied with other groups most notably the jews who knew how to money and this is at least referenced and acknowledged what isn't made so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own mafia's but most of them made their money and went legit and why not who wants to die in jail br br joseph was a ruthless man prepared to kill if needs be but not an unfair or stupid one his story was tragic in that he could have made money in the over ground world and he showed a special skill in avoiding getting killed with a little bit of luck attached naturally br br despite the range of respectable names and three actors in the title role bruce ramsay martin landau and tony there isn't the charisma or the talent to bring us in and feel anything we are merely passive observers in a life we are glad not to have lead the people shown here were born in to a cruel world but their only mark was to make it crueler br br if you can't get enough of the gangster genre that will be better than watching godfather 1 2 for the tenth time and it is even better as basic entertainment than the horrible misfire that was godfather 3
<START> at the heart of almost every truly great crime thriller is a carefully considered methodically planned out high stakes super crime which 9 times out of 10 is committed by a bunch of likable grey scale morality underdogs for who life isn't fair for whom getting back at the man is well something worth cheering for first time screenwriter james v simpson's script for armored gets this half right he made extra double sure that we've got nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned iraq war veteran ty hackett stomp the yard's columbus short who's about to have his house taken away by an evil bank brother i've been there and he gave ty a good family friend in mike matt dillon who is super nice and gets him a job at the armored car company that he works at with lawrence fishbourne and some weird french dude jean reno these guys like to have fun and play pranks but they are also serious armored car guys too so that means they carry guns and are tough br br after a short while as one theoretically watches armored one might start to think as i did that maybe just maybe this is going to be some kind of awesome tongue in cheek cornball heist movie with some on the nose characterizations that move the story along its natural course cranking up the personal stakes of all involved in hopes of unveiling a really really clever plan with lots of potential 'holy sh t' moments i mean the music alone is textbook heist movie gritty edgy beats working overtime as we're treated to close ups of characters who say things like as a matter of fact i do and are you crazy for 45 minutes or so the movie had some serious genre flick potential br br then things start to really stink these dudes these idiots have no plan there's no ok here's what we're gonna do scene no blueprints no explosives no black van or ski masks despite their run' as can be seen in a trailer no these guys are going to steal 42 million dollars from their own trucks which are only being tracked by hourly contact over the radio despite being equipped with some fancy big deal technology' and they aren't even going to sit down and discuss it hell mike only tells ty about the plan the night before which is completely ridiculous but of course got his house to think about so as long as mike promises that 'no one will get hurt ' he's on board guess what though somebody gets hurt why because besides driving the trucks into an abandoned factory to hide the money they have no plan that was it that was how far they thought things out so naturally things start to unravel these cats deserve everything they get for being so unprepared br br this script frankly feels like it's like the product of some bad improv game armored car robbed by its own guards go despite some half decent buildup that could have maybe taken the film in a few interesting directions the story just completely falls apart and pretty soon nothing makes sense or is even remotely plausible br br when filmmakers don't have a cool hook for their heist their characters seem stupid and bungling and when characters are stupid and bungling it's hard for an audience to invest in them and their story and when that happens any suspense drains out the bottom of the movie leaving a laughable hollow husk br br skip it 3 10
<START> i like movies about quirky people one flew over the cuckoo's nest is maybe my all time favorite so one can imagine i had a blast with this one it's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling this movie is unpredictable and intense some scenes are downright frightening even after multiple viewings because this kind of stuff really can happen it will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride and after you see the ending if you're not deeply disturbed you really should check yourself for a pulse br br the acting was phenomenal marcy with her rather extreme case of tourette's shifts from quirky cute to utterly terrifying sometimes appearing so out of control that she looks like the undead seth was great too the focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on marcy though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character br br it's a classic love story with some unconventional twists and it's also my favorite love story next to true romance there are two bad reviews for it up here but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film while the other was just looking for some hollywood thrills without the deep characters and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store the point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something normal or lighthearted this one is messed up and indie as can be and won't let you go until the heavy climax
<START> this is definitely a girl movie my husband found it utterly boring but i think this is a really sweet movie it's amazing to think that just a note can bring so many people together this is a great get away for anyone who loves a cute funny romance
<START> as other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie keeping it kid friendly fx was low class they should of spent the 1 on a coke as is typical with these d movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead hope the money was worth it for really really big step down from babylon 5 nice to see what happened to buck rogers but damn this was low even for him ' it was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also don't watch br br warning spoiler below br br this thing chased down everyone it was after and yet boxlietner got away that was pure bs and the ending how in the hell did the kids end up right there with him that was just too much stupidity
<START> i am obviously disappointed so i'll be brief and won't waste your time first off the plot was uninspired at least the animation was even worse we're in 2008 for god's sake and it looked like a version of g i joe i won't even bother characterizing the actors' performance and the dialogs or maybe i will 'cause i just saw that in order to post a comment over here you need 10 lines where were we oh yeah the performance well it was totally flat lacking passion and talent if i am excused now as for the dialogs just like the acting no memorable quotes nothing that someone wouldn't expect let's just hope the movie will be decent at least
<START> with documentary films the question of realism always crops up how much of the film is real and how much is manipulated by the film maker in little dieter needs to fly herzog is far too absorbed in telling the story of a man telling his own story to even address the question of realism versus formalism from the beginning herzog's role as storyteller is obvious luckily he is a master storyteller little dieter is the finest most engaging documentary i have ever seen story is enthralling and herzog's efforts at reenactment putting dieter through the paces of reliving his story on location while it is being filmed are very effective the story that dieter tells is real but herzog is ever present wrenching absurdist commentary from the realism this film is a must see for any students of documentary film and or of werner herzog
<START> one should not be too critical about the director's second feature br br i really like the camera work of as mr shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things br br however howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images remember he has not got any education of any sort i don't think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos worse still looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14 br br any way if you overcome above mentioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work
<START> it's amazing to think that this movie came out only one year before star wars but seems a million years behind it in sophistication and special effects actually the art direction and set design nice victorian space ship aren't bad it's the monster costumes that are the most laughable resembling the guy in a rubber suit monsters from the lost in space tv show the evil cave man makeup reminded me of some of the aliens from ancient twilight zone reruns br br the script is stilted and outside of peter cushing's comic relief the acting is pretty miserable too this movie is only recommended if you really enjoy bad kitschy sf and the music yikes a horrible 70s experiment with synthesizers that doesn't fit the time period of the film and which sounds like someone rambling with a and a 2 track tape machine
<START> these writers are trying to re create the characters they have on scrubs in a different occupation however the characters they are stuck with have no charisma or acting ability not to mention the writing seems poor and effortless these guys are trying to create something that would be good if the writing wasn't so disgusting which is leaving the shows only lifeline to be two attractive teachers that that are barely keeping it alive the humor in this show seems like it is trying to target an audience with an i q of 40 or below another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the show scrubs is excellent and this show has to follow it up leaving the viewer in an odd position not knowing whether to cry or to just lose hope in new sitcoms all together this is just my opinion but i think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves anymore than they have already
