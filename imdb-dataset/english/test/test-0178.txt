<START> i only voted excellent because this film took two snapshots of americana one in 1970 and one for every year afterward br br nothing's really changed br br joe is actually a jerk a big stupid slob who's mad at everybody else in the world for his own idiocy this ain't really a spoiler but the key to the film is the big corporate never does wrong guy making friends with this semi joe and he gets some kind of validation from his bigotry and stupidity and sense of being wronged br br yet few would argue that the dealer boyfriend did deserve to die and those kids shouldn't have ripped joe and compton off and joe and compton were actually getting into the hash and the young skin until they got ripped off a simple film in many ways except that in 1970 new york city was par to a battle zone thanks to nixon's care and all of the money going to the war in vietnam as i write this 2 25 2007 there is a very long wait on netflix for this film which makes me happy because i think there are people out there who want to learn this was a pretty good snapshot not exact a bit caricaturist but actually pretty close to how it was back then and the scary thing is things haven't changed that much sure there's no more welfare but that just means the wage slavery has won out br br amazing how millionaires will complain about not making enough money then complain that 5 15 an hour is too much to pay their people
<START> what a great show a very underrated dramatic show it is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character s are the main character s i think the best character on the show is vern he is a tough bad guy and an aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be this show has many murders i think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show but i have to admit that is one of the reasons why i think the show is so great i think some characters were killed off a little early but some sure still made their mark you can't compare things like prison break to this show they are totally different i think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them a great show my favorite's a show that should be considered of the the greats for years to come
<START> the battle at gulch was griffith's longest and most expensive short he had made up to that point in it we see him trying to perfect the large scale action scene that would be necessary in his full length features packing in all the elements that had made his previous action shorts successful br br griffith uses the western format Â already the ideal backdrop for pure straight ahead action set pieces Â as the setting for his first epic battle like many westerns of the 1910s the starting point is a character from the east heading out west Â a device which perhaps helped ease the audience into the wilderness and here those easterners are a pair of children which was important for the type of picture this develops into for griffith you couldn't have action without a sense of vulnerability and here he crams it in with the kids from back east lillian gish as the distraught mother of the only baby in town and even some puppies that are at risk of ending up on the menu br br all this paves the way for an exceedingly complex and layered action sequence blending the trapped heroine scenario and the ride to the rescue with the battles that griffith had been depicting since his earliest civil war pictures in 1909 there is a phenomenal amount going on here and griffith does very well at maintaining the exhilarating pace throughout and keeping everything coherent and logical however juggling x amount of elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make it that many times more exciting no matter how skilfully they are balanced and griffith did create better tension soaked finales before and after this one br br but even a griffith picture so heavily focused on action would not be without its drama characterisation and atmospherics in the battle at gulch the emotional set up is dealt with briefly but economically first we have the scene in which the waifs leave their home the cart they travel on heads away from the camera making use of depth and distance to express their moving away from safety and civilization an equally effective scene is the one in which we are introduced to the young family of gish bobby harron and their baby the people of the town coo over the precious tot then off screen revealing that two indians were watching them from the background adding a sinister little note of danger br br of course many viewers today have pointed out the battle at offensive portrayal of native americans in contrast with the more sympathetic red man's view but perhaps all is not what it seems first of all take a look at the indian chief's son's Â it's black and covered in shiny white dots it looks to me like a pearly king's jacket perhaps modified slightly for the warmer climate now have a look at the war dance they perform later on Â it has a certain knees up mother brown air to it these aren't indians they're cockneys so it shouldn't be offensive to native americans just cockneys
<START> what a shocker for starters i couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying the jerky camera movements were also annoying the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot and then there's the ending i'm still not really sure what to make of it i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid br br the case had a couple of those little award winner nominations symbols on it so i figured it couldn't be too bad i was wrong if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
<START> but to be a little more precise i do not think that it is as bad as it actually could be eventhough the actors famous to semi famous didn't do a very great job directors fault could be the script as well hard for me to say anyway if you are after a lot of cool guns and action this is not the movie for you but they do run around with a lot of ww2 vintage guns sort of fun well i guess i could say more but it just doesn't feel as if it's worth it if you are desperate enough or a hackman freak see it otherwise don't br br live well and prosper
<START> i always felt that ms had never gotten a role fitting her skills familiar to millions as the lt on law and order she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases always in a supporting role hbo's lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna new york a suburb of buffalo br br the story could be set in any major african american community of the 50's and 60's from sweet auburn to new york's harlem but the segregation integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nanny's boarding house the story revolves around nanny's relationships with all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the business i purposely did not say black actors this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black except for jimmy of course i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day
<START> imaginary heroes is a 2004 film starring sigourney weaver jeff daniels emile hirsch michelle williams and kip br br the story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child commits suicide br br ordinary people has been mentioned often in relation to this film it's sort of ordinary people with a role reversal the mother in this case sandy travis weaver is more accessible than the father ben daniels who is clearly devastated and unable to cope like ordinary people the younger son tim hirsch is the focus of the film br br for me the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it there were some wonderful interactions mother and son mother and neighbor brother and sister williams and some good offbeat moments what never clicked was ben being any part of that family or having any chemistry with sandy this seems to have been the goal of director writer dan harris in one scene in a grocery store the checkout kid assumes sandy is about 30 and gives her his phone number in almost the next scene daniels asks sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday weaver was 55 when this film was made actually probably 54 and looks phenomenal so what is ben looking at however there's something askew about ben's complete detachment because the viewer doesn't really see how daniels ever was attached to that family br br the end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes everyone is very good with weaver and hirsch being the standouts br br there's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares the script could have been sharper but imaginary heroes is a good effort
<START> i honestly fail to understand why people love this show so much a friend of mine watches this and since i like sci fi i tried to watch along since the plot of the show sounded promising but in truth it really is a very boring show the only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the video game like cgi effects and the complete overuse of muppets note that i call it muppets because they actually really look like muppets not like the aliens they should be br br speaking of which the muppets and make up effects are horribly overused in this show you have this guy who could be best described as a alien dwarf hybrid you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vamp girl you've got a floating potty mouth frog alien it just feels very unnecessary and furthermore even to the point that you feel distracted from the whole storyline about a lost astronaut br br every episode is also too much of a stand alone the creators of this show directed this in such a way that every episode almost feels like a whole other show at least up until the point that you see the main characters muppets again that is the whole plot about the main character getting back to earth is way to much pushed to the background at points the acting is also quite bad br br conclusion if you want good sci fi just look somewhere else this isn't even real sci fi to begin with in my opinion since the show is more aimed at fantasy elements with all the puppetry and weird dreams going on and if you just want to see muppets then i suggest you watch the muppet show and feel glad that this abomination of a show has come to a end br br by the way doesn't anyone have with the concept of a living spaceship thats right doctor who started that concept almost about 30 years ago this show is like a collection of 'sci fi' leftovers scripts and events that were abandoned for a good reason only to be picked up by this horrible show
<START> how sad it is when a film as wonderful as jurassic park slowly into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise the newest sequel jurassic park iii has given no thought to characters a story or pretty much a script and instead relies on non stop dinosaur action which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch the dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology after 7 years of cgi advancements it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name the introduction of a pterodactyl does not a great movie make br br go see shrek again br br
<START> i quit watching the west wing after aaron quit writing and producing it just wasn't the same imagine my thrill at seeing a film that he wrote again it has been a long time the american president a few good men his script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy he made a compelling story believable and made me weep at the same time br br tom hanks was incredible as a small time texas congressman whose constituents only wanted lower taxes and to keep their guns not a hard job so he had plenty of time to fool around and that he did his office staff looked as if he were at the playboy mansion like he reportedly said you can teach them to type but you can't teach them to grow tits despite his sexist attitude which fits right in with a texas congressman they were fiercely loyal especially his aide amy adams junebug former hooters girl br br now add a rich texas socialite who wants something done in afghanistan played perfectly by julia roberts and a pain in his boss's ass cia agent superbly done by philip seymour hoffman and you have a movie well worth watching br br outstanding writing and superlative acting and a story that needed to be told what more do you want at the movies
<START> in spite of many positive reviews this is a very slow film with three essentially good actors improvising the most banal dialog you will ever hear this is another road movie that really goes no where the camera frequently goes out of focus and the constant panning in some of the over long scenes is annoying br br the three characters are attractive but note likable the cast also sets what must be an intergalactic record for the use of the tired word dude even howard stern has abandoned this tired pronoun br br the three primary actors and one supporting actor show great promise they are clearly comfortable and bravely allow themselves to be depicted as shallow and even goofy the character actors all seem as they are plucky amateurs who generously volunteered to speak a few lines indeed they all physically fit their roles well br br all in all a dull 90 minutes that seems more like an eternity this is among my ten worst films of all time
<START> mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more and you don't want most of it br br first and foremost this whole thing just doesn't make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a bus load of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades he has also vowed to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him br br however when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster bates looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burton's dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for Â£50 000 and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut he figures it is better than killing him br br a wealth of things arise here which just don't add up br br 1 why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing br br 2 not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke br br 3 hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off without protection i may add to take confession no way br br 4 rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why aren't the cops checking the place out br br 5 rourke hangs around the church and blind niece in particular for days afterward without anybody bothering him what he's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid br br 6 the cops actually meet rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing they don't even check up on him br br 7 why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat you'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other br br 8 why does bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not restrain himself for a few days at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states ridiculous br br 9 rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and besides she falls in love with him in record time a few days br br 10 the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates' point of view br br 11 things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in jest along bates' houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl br br 12 rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked br br 13 priest is an ex army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalled for and yet another cringe worthy scene br br i'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning rourke's hair so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing style br br i have just mentioned them br br overall a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director br br 4 10
<START> i'm not exactly sure why i ordered from netflix probably because i enjoy bbc dramas it was on a list of recommendations i had no idea what i was about to see the plot which i will only describe in general so as not to spoil it for anyone who will see it after reading my review has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the rockies of the sort that appear in caper movies they are very unusual in a period drama not having read the novel and i do not intend to do so i was totally unprepared for the surprise that ends the first segment on the dvd and equally surprised by the subsequent twists and turns nonetheless it is extremely well acted by the two young principals by sally hawkins in particular as sue and by elaine cassidy as maud and in key supporting roles by imelda staunton as the mother figure in a house of thieves and by charles dance as the rich uncle who collects pornographic materials and who rescues young maud from the mad house where her mother lived to be his secretary the lesbian affair between maud and sue is the big news in the movie but really not its centerpiece the centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune that maud is due on her 21st birthday the turns and twists in the plot add tension though not much credibility to the movie however no viewer is likely to doubt that maud and sue will somehow end up together improbably as the credits roll although one has been raised as a and serves a collector of pornography and the other is a pickpocket posing as a lady's maid the author obviously means for them to live together in the end it's a bit difficult to swallow since each has conspired to cheat the other despite these reservations i liked movie well enough it does not quite deserve the praise that others have lavished on it the most fearsome and interesting scenes take place inside the madhouse where one of the two young women has been confined until she is able to escape and return to london to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion sally hawkins sue is a very impressive young actress able to convey her character's cascading and changing emotions with her facial expressions and her eyes no doubt we'll see more of her i certainly hope so
<START> i give this a 10 out of 10 not because the plot was hard to uncover because it wasn't but because it leaves one caring for the characters the acting by all the cast is superb especially joan and it's a marvellous episode because of it's heart br br miss marple is called upon by jason dying request to investigate and solve a murder that happened some seven or eight years previously and she has to discover who why and when as she goes along mr is the same as was in a caribbean mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here br br nemesis is definitely one for the amateur psychologists among us and if you are one of those who is only happy with lots of blood guts and rip roaring action sequences then you won't like it but if you are like me one who loves knowing about people and discovering what makes them tick then nemesis is the one for you
<START> in a bizarre experiment an astronaut is abandoned on the moon as alice florinda bolkan a troubled translator living in italy wakes from a nightmare about a lunar mission mixed with an old movie that frightened her as a child she also has no recollection of the last three days except for a torn photo of the hotel she finds in her apartment fired from her job alice heads to that resort island to try and piece together the mystery br br often touted as a giallo due to it's director the fifth luigi and the presence of evelyn stewart and klaus kinski footprints is actually a deliberately paced psycho thriller with sci fi overtones blurring the distinction between dream reality memory and movies the disturbing story is beautifully photographed by oscar winner vittorio storaro with a pensive score by nicola piovani it also combines elements of such diverse films as armando and visconti's death in venice in it's depiction of alienation isolation hallucination and maybe madness brazilian actress florinda bolkan on screen all the time does a redux of her carol hammond in lucio fulci's a lizard in a woman's skin as alice a young woman thrust into a mystery that makes her question her sanity the locations mirror alice's unstable state of mind the island of off season with it's arabic influence and ancient ruins is a lonely almost mystical place unwilling to give up its secrets evelyn stewart has a bit in the beginning as a concerned friend and oscar winner lila kedrova are hotel guests peter plays a handsome biologist trying to help bolkan and the ever intense klaus kinski is in the film within a film footprints on the moon br br footprints is a classy case of guaranteed 100 euro weird but not for everyone there's only one murder toward the end but you won't see it coming as the film starts to come together
