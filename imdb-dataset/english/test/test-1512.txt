<START> a pre nerd robert carradine a pre desi arnaz jr and an almost pre pubescent melanie griffith take to the road and head for alaska with romantic dreams of becoming wealthy salmon well their dream is about as exciting as this lackluster youth road movie they aren't particularly interesting and the film doesn't exactly have much of a point beyond we got together the spawn of some famous people and made a low budget film about their misadventures ' out of the cannon of 60's and 70's road films and rebel youth films this one is mediocre under developed uninvolving characters not much wit not much freshness to the story which is as bland as the films muddy landscape br br but for those who care they head to alaska and apparently alaska was like the wild west in the 70's because everyone carries a gun and is rough and tumble robert carradine says charming things like i hope we can find a shower my nuts sure itch ' and he's the one with melanie griffith they are quickly robbed and forced to take jobs and the local bigwig their employer puts the moves on melanie and eventually fires desi for not being corrupt that's when they aren't smart and do not leave town opting instead to eat dog food or go hungry get beat up by the guys goons and then take a joyride in the bigwigs car the final half of the film abandons the evil bigwig as the trio commit a robbery go on the run and hatch a kidnapping scheme and so forth the film just sort of ends annoyingly and ambiguously but seeing as how they didn't bother to have much character development and story in the first place its rather appropriate worth a look if you are really into low budget 70's fare but ultimately pretty forgettable
<START> i have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life but none are coming to mind right now hell ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that tarantino brought back and did right in movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs the problem with hell ride is unlike pf and rd the story is garbage and so is character development how many movies does bishop think he can blatantly steal from the brief case in pulp fiction the air gun in no country etc etc speaking of bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie i couldn't help but laugh at those scenes where he's standing with his trusted out desperately trying to seem like some hardened biker nothing in this movie is believable and why dennis hopper did they really need the easy rider motif too i blame larry bishop for his horrible plot and dialogue not to mention his failed attempt at the leading role don't bother watching this movie it's a waste of time
<START> i went to see this movie mostly because it looked so good in the trailers robin williams and barry levinson should equal greatness instead it just continues williams' bad streak of movies lately what's wrong with the movie more like what's right the ensemble crew does a pretty good job around robin and like usual christopher walken is fantastic that being said this movie just plain wasn't good i really only recommend seeing it if you want to see what it would be like if jon stewart ran for president and won saying he won isn't a spoiler since it was in the trailer the concept and idea is really amusing but that's all most of robin's jokes are just recycled from old comedy bits of his and there are very few laugh out loud moments and most are just dumb like most comedies that turn out to suck all of the funny bits are put into the trailer really no surprises there but come on some of the movie reads like a tom clancy or vince flynn novel people were expecting this to be robin's return to greatness instead it's more a flubber
<START> a blackly comic tale of a down trodden priest showcases the economy that luis bunuel was able to achieve in being able to tell a deeply humanist fable with a minimum of fuss as an output from his mexican era of film making it was an invaluable talent to possess with little money and extremely tight schedules however surpasses many of bunuel's previous mexican films in terms of the acting francisco is excellent narrative and theme br br the theme interestingly is something that was explored again in made three years later in spain it concerns the individual's struggle for humanity and altruism amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue father however is portrayed more sympathetically than sister whereas the latter seems to choose charity because she wishes to atone for her perceived sins whole existence and reason for being seems to be to help others whether they or we like it or not the film's last scenes in which he casts doubt on his behaviour and in a split second has to choose between the life he has been leading or the conventional life that is expected of a priest are so emotional because they concern his moral integrity and we are never quite sure whether it remains intact or not br br this is a remarkable film and i would urge anyone interested in classic cinema to seek it out it is one of bunuel's most moving films and encapsulates many of his obsessions frustrated desire mad love religious hypocrisy etc in my view is second only to 'the exterminating angel' in terms of his mexican movies and is certainly near the top of the list of bunuel's total filmic output
<START> bobby and mikey are two little boys who move across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life soon after the family settles in their mom marries the king who ends up being an abusive stepfather especially to bobby so bobby decides that he will fly away from the abuse in his birthday present br br this movie was difficult to watch especially the abuse scenes it was hard to watch an innocent playful little boy become abused and turn into a sullen scared and withdrawn young man the acting is excellent br br i cried throughout the last half of the movie there were some funny scenes in it too like the monster brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles br br i wouldn't suggest letting little kids watch it it was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really really flew away
<START> i work in an office on weekends and there is a tv that only gets one channel so i don't have the option of turning to something better i keep it on though because it provides a little background noise sometimes i get a decent movie show not today today i got breaker breaker the city looks like a third rate set which of course it is all the actors and bad guys look like they just graduated from stuntman school i have seen better dramatic enactments at a carnival the special effects flames at end of movie are more fake then michael jacksons masculinity even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor a badly acted badly shot badly written movie
<START> ahh i didn't order no amazing hit show we'll you got one hack is simply the greatest television show ever made a little bit of me died when i flicked on the t v one friday night to catch a little hack and it wasn't on the show dug deep into key social issues of our culture i found that at the end of any episode i watched i walked away having been both entertained and informed i am actually dumber now that hack is gone i no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate since hack has been gone i see them as and an unneeded strain on so for the love of god we need to bring back hack
<START> as someone who used to spend hours driving around the backstreets of north london in an attempt to avoid the horrific congestion this film immediately appealed throw in my interest in what london was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of tv heaven on paper the film ticked all the right boxes and having just watched the knowledge the actual movie itself certainly lived up to if not exceeded my high expectations br br visually i was surprised how different london looked back then i lived in in the 90s long after gentrification had transformed the area it truly came across as grimy tatty and down at heel london may still have bad housing estates but the general feel of the place is much cleaner brighter and pleasant nowadays based on what this movie shows rather than my own memories br br as for the story and the acting well top marks obviously go to nigel hawthorne as the vampire absolutely brilliant he acts deliberately unpredictably alternating between total straight faced severity and surreal mindgames in order to unnerve the knowledge boys as he puts them through test after test br br all in all this was an excellent thoroughly enjoyable trip back into a very specific time and place that i find endlessly fascinating but even if you're not especially interested in london circa 1979 you'll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and likable characters of the knowledge
<START> this is my favorite horror film a close 2nd to 'poltergeist' i saw 'one dark night' when it first came out in theaters in 1983 at the theater where i worked br br i was born in 1963 so i have a certain love for '80's horror films despite them being a little dated and the dialog not well written what i thought was so original about it was that the phenomenon of has not been addressed at least to my knowledge at that time and is a very real phenomenon br br i didn't care if adam west was in it nothing against him but his supporting role was not memorable but thought meg tilly was good casting the little known donald hutton from and from mars' as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw studies on abilities was sadly overlooked as a gay guy i was paying more attention to david mason daniels meg tilly's unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend he's selling real estate in texas now br br i felt the film 'realistic' in two ways who was discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment had a funeral that was sparse in attendance reflecting the fact that not only was he mysterious a hermit but a killer as you know these types are buried without fanfare second if corpses were going to be mobile they would hover dragging their feet the filmmakers could have gone for the schlock walking groaning arms out stretched zombies but opted for what would be believable kudos the buzzing electrical discharge from eyes at his like he's overseeing his kingdom of dead cast an eerie light in the mausoleum that will stay with you for years if you've ever gone to a mausoleum even on a sunny day you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass windows don't get me started on the cavernous silence even himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric perverted old man the score was one of a kind and memorable and i keep kicking myself for not getting it on cassette when it first came out the track shooting was done where it was supposed to be i especially liked the carefully planned characteristics of each corpse the bride the badly child still holding its teddy bear the grandmother the tall thin black guy and the half faced world war ii vet and the green eyed elderly gent who was the first to greet the clique even corpses can be good actors i suppose the only thing i had to groan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choke julie's boyfriend couldn't possibly be done unless a corpse was put in laying on it's stomach and feet first but why it looked a little to fresh too br br the film begins eerie with us never seeing face until the last quarter of the film which is like unwrapping a birthday present as he is picking up teen girl runaways in his daughter's psychic flash we then see hauling his body away in his one bedroom apartment where we see he's experimented his telekinetic craft by dishes into his wall the rest does drag as the heathers like group baits julie into a final initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum but it is a well placed build up to the unleashing horror later the movie isn't bloody in any sense of the word the goriest part is when daughter uses a compact mirror to feed his power back to him and he bubbles then melts i've always felt that a power like could never die and a sequel could be worth looking into i can see it now one dark night ii turning in the grave but let's face it the film stands alone i heard the film had other titles but the original fits br br a remake would be pointless but if there were to be one i would write better dialog and lengthen some scenes such as show the studies on abilities done in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder in this information age something like that would be well documented on dvd and more corpses why just raise the ones in the mausoleum when power could spread to the graveyard too let's just say i'd hate to be one of the persons who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax something that too can be shown i think having one of the initiating sisters recognize one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good if disturbing character with cg effects some awesome scenes with animating cremated remains would be off the wall br br say what you will about 'one dark night' but it has it all so see at least once in your life or death
<START> i am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has it is a screwball comedy romance film rolled together by someone besides billy wilder but it does a really good job even won an oscar br br it is ingrid bergman's first film in the us since the 1950's even though she is no longer the young bombshell she was in her early films she brings off a difficult role quite handsomely this film proves she had multiple talents beyond her good looks br br goldie hawn who won an oscar in this her first film as supporting actress is very good as the modern sophisticated yet quirky latest mistress to dentist playboy love them leave them walter goldie is delightful to all the senses in this role which with a great cast set her up as a slam dunk for this early career award br br this film is not real deep but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well not sure why it's average is so low as i give it a solid 8
<START> there are so many more complexities to the plot of this wonderful thought provoking movie than just infidelity and cover up of responsibility for the accident i was struck by the initial seeming goodness of husband wilkinson who wanted the driver when he thought it was everett disclosed to the police and the change of heart and morals when he learned it was his wife as well was he indeed good and or was he attempting to redeem self by allowing her to go with rupert then things she decided the right ting to do was admit that she hit him most importantly the theme of redemption for the accident for the infidelity in her own odd flawed way is strongest in watson's care for everett i believe that is why she undertook that effort br br this seems to be a common theme in modern british novels brideshead revisited the end of the affair come to mind love it
<START> oh but this is woeful one good actor after another turns in lamentable dialogue in half hearted fashion under what must have been incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable i like robert carlyle and joanne whalley is one of my favourite actresses tom courtney can act well when pushed and david suchet is a professional of the highest integrity but they all around like fish in a barrel of watery gin i swear courtney was inebriated on painkillers or both br br was there a good performance in the whole thing well yes david hood as the junior underground engineer whose mate got washed away looked like he was taking the thing seriously and credit to him for that it can't be easy when all around are losing theirs so to speak or maybe his scenes came under the direction of the assistant director if there was one i just don't know what these people were doing in a film that was this poor other than paying the bills obviously i can't begin to say how disappointed i am in them you should be ashamed of yourselves br br any positives other than david hood the third yes the aerial shots of london largely submerged were very well done and the effects artists responsible deserved better than to have their fine work punctuated by such a shallow story if you'll forgive the expression as those few people that do see them will do so on a far smaller screen than would be to best advantage br br what's going on here why are british film makers trying to imitate such characterless spectacle driven tabloid level genres as the disaster movie and then doing it even worse than the americans gritty realism character integrity the capture of real emotion in a way that makes you feel it and care the family way spring and port wine get carter the long good friday trainspotting don't get me wrong i like a bit of escapist hokum the real italian job the adventures of tom jones but oh that it should come to this there was more realistic drama in carry on camping
<START> the numbers don't lie 109 people have voted for this film that says a great deal about the standing of one of the most intuitively insightful comedians of the late 20th century and for those of you who know the work of bill hicks if he were alive today imagine what he would have to say about the boy president from his home state that his short career remains unrecognized is a sad situation and this film or rather these two films explain why first you see how his talent was obvious from the start again and again those who knew bill hicks always say he was not only funny he was also unique the film also shows how the quality of his material was too challenging for many in the entertainment industry his drinking also contributed to his career problems but that is less evident in this film and then the second film is a complete performance if you have never seen or heard bill hicks this is a wonderful introduction to the person and his dark but intelligent humor especially due to the fact that the topics are now almost 14 years old yet remain ironically up to date is underlined by the fact that many of the events took place under the first president bush br br watching them together first the biography and then the performance makes you aware of how greatly talented this young man was how quickly his life passed and how the american media can sometimes act as the great big let's make sure nothing is too provocative nothing will be too interesting and the result well as the man himself said go to sleep america your government is in control in his lifetime at least in great britian this artist was recognized for his talent and was successful there 11 years after his death 109 people at imdb can say something about the film after you've seen them both i hope you understand why more people should be listening to bill hicks
<START> i couldn't stand to watch very much of this crap this is your standard junk that certain annoying women love old english era drama with lots of costumes and clichÃ© characters that seem to be plucked from either directly from oliver twist or some other dickens novel this uses the usual clichÃ©s from the victorian era certain idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of that culture being so bloody repressed is somehow fascinating and romantic this is sap pure and utter junk and boring as watching grass grow as such it is perfect for women who crave some sort of english countryside snoozer romantic drama in a victorian setting but for this man this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment to watch a bunch of drab boring scenes with unoriginal characters speaking in that wretched forced and fake english accent
<START> i first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on tv and i was up far too late i really lucked out there though it's truly incredible from the location as isolated as it's possible to be on this planet it made the abyss look like et in the council swimming pool through the interesting characters keith david is especially good as the reactionary childs what if we're wrong about him then we're wrong and the effects more yucky than alien br br moreover however the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects it's the people you start being scared of knowing that one of them may or may not be all they appear to be it's certainly got the feel of who goes there br br the soundtrack is great it really plays up the isolation fear and gravity of the situation br br finally the epilogue scene really really cuts even more than the but then again who does punchline of bladerunner enough said
