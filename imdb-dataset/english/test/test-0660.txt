<START> like a lot of people i loved the original american graffiti was one of the great movies of the 70s the sequel more american graffiti is a horrible depressing mess of a movie it wasn't funny the wide eyed likable characters had become cynical and jaded and the stories were contrived such as laurie's character having another brother because richard dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and terry the toad and pharaoh joe somehow managing to serve together in vietnam they even have a police officer by the name of harrison ford's character in the original who makes a cameo he doesn't even look like harrison ford who was way too big a star by 1979 to even bother with this garbage br br the operative word here is funny this movie isn't even amusing debbie candy clark is a stripper mixed in with a bunch of dope hippies and trying to bail her dealer boyfriend out of jail steve and laurie ron howard and cindy williams the lovebirds in the original have two kids and have become an annoying bickering couple adorable little tomboy carol mackenzie phillips has become rainbow yet another hippie child john milner paul is a loser race car driver whose fortune was foretold at the end of the original even wolfman jack whose voice was such an integral part of the original and gave it such a great flow only is heard sporadically br br perhaps it was different writers a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive story line that makes this movie such a dismal failure br br the episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere to be found in the sequel it was a movie that didn't need to be made and its best just to remember what a great movie american graffiti was and avoid the movie with more in the title
<START> let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover with that said anyone who says this is the worst film ever is being dramatic and anyone who says that the film is great is completely delusional the film is what it is and what is that a modest budget 4 million i estimate studio sequel the film isn't terrible but for road house fans it will be a disappointment and that brings me to problem one just as dirty dancing wouldn't been what it was without swayze road house isn't the same without him the lead lacks depth character and likability to carry the film i feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get patrick to do it if they were gonna do a sequel the other cast was uneven with outstanding actors like will patton along side day players who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag busey who i have seen do great characters seemed like he just mailed it in ellen was played well except for not being believable at all as a bayou raised chick sherri the dea agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped the writer totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters instead opting for a base one dimensional film which leads me to the biggest problem the script i got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an and and an it looked very amateur and that is what the writing was i heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core sucking began some cheezy parts of the film to watch for are during the first undercover meeting the obvious drug deal under the table hey lets meet at a crowded bar i will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table wait make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking second i love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a lark 10 minutes later there are some nasty editing cuts towards the end of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a patron which brings me to the realism of the dea training i won't both to get technical but jumping thru doors isn't standard training nor do typical female agents who bust their butts to make it in a male oriented field act like weak characters boring thanks for the chauvinistic view heir director there is other stuff i could teach a course at a school about it the sped up fighting the cheezy dialogue the recycled story etc but aside from all that you just cannot like ex mr applegate he totally lacks the humble zen coolness that made mr patrick swayze such a bad ass he just strikes me as one of those 5 foot nothing actors who think they are a bad ass but just like van damnit he runs into a real bad ass chuck in van don't case and he gives him a lesson about therefore that i feel is the major linchpin of the film if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass you don't have to try example swayze if you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things then well you are why your audience the average joe will not rent this film and if they do they will write reviews like this
<START> the original title always struck me as a rather overblown definition for a bunch of gun toting saddle tramps still their screen presence was at least underscored by a top quality group of actors to support yul brynner most were movie stars in their own right br br however this first sequel was a pale imitation with a group now composed of largely b and c list players who were more mediocre than magnificent it was a similar set up had to recruit yet another team of gun toting saddle tramps to sort out the mexican problems again another tyrant was giving them grief br br with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer the budget was evidently very limited this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic it was also more than half an hour shorter than john sturges' original yet we still had a reprise of the agonising and moralising that made even the first a little turgid at times however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up was less expansive it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original br br generally it just lacked imagination the first movie had been a smash hit and this pedestrian sequel was evidently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to cynically cash in on former success and it shows there's very much a 'made for tv' feel about it br br not recommended
<START> from the point of budget 2 cad isn't very much when you look at the animatronics puppetry in this film that alone being the reason for the 9 week shoot i was really keen to see this film and had hoped to catch it when it came out instead got it on dvd recently my main problem is it's just not funny at all it's better than tenacious d which hasn't got a funny bone in it's body but this was a truly disappointing film br br trevor matthews is a very strong physically performer but his acting sucks rachel gives what is possibly one of the most irritating and none funny performances i have ever seen the only really big star in this is david scott who's artwork for the monsters is fab his special effects work is the main reason this film is worth watching loved the cyclops and troll and and the prof monster was straight out of the henson library br br if you watch this it won't be the biggest waste of time but if you are looking to see this for a great horror comedy romp don't bother
<START> this is truly a re make that should never have gotten out of the stable it has two casts that are acting in entirely different strata at the top of their game are joan plowright and maximillian schell every nuance of the franks is in plain sight at the rock bottom are melissa gilbert and doris roberts i cannot imagine how schell and plowright manage to play so well when gilbert and roberts are working their anti magic gilbert ruins every scene she's in it's like father knows best in the ghetto she's ann frank light her run at helen keller was thin but not awful this is sacrilege doris roberts makes mrs van damm merely annoying she is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious dissatisfied presence caused so much trouble in het this needed to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what it was like to voluptuous her weight is not the problem joan plowright could have played this part beautifully roberts was on a career high when this was made getting lots of press and many opportunities her performance here displays her weaknesses as an actress shamefully br br james coco and clive have most of their scenes with gilbert and roberts and strong though they are they are completely incapable of undoing the damage done by their partners is a wily actor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by ed in the original film he gets no support from gilbert she drain the color out of every scene br br i've read with dismay the comments by those of you who grew up watching this version filled with attachment to these performances it's a lesson in how the version you see first to you it makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products i loved in my childhood i encourage you to watch the original it has very few weak spots and it's head and shoulders above this mess
<START> let's be fair there are no rules for scriptwriting so i won't say the movie should be something other than it is i'll just state my opinion ok i really liked the script the way things are told and characters are introduced however i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen it could maybe try and fit this other media since this movie was directed by joÃ£o the same man who directed the play it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical it's the man's first movie for out loud what i'm saying is there are parts in the film like the city of which slightly resembles the set of dia de maria that feel like we're not at a movie theater we're at the theater lines are spoken too formally characters are moving and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage sure maybe that was the intention but that's been done on stage wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie the beautiful closer for instance when i went to see this one though i didn't feel like i was watching a movie but overall it was a good one worth watching it's a nice love story funny at times and sad at others my vote is a 7
<START> owen david and chloe denise richards are a youngish couple living in manhattan owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while chloe is an aspiring actress happily for her chloe gets big role on a sitcom and temporarily moves to hollywood missing her owen books a flight to lala land as a surprise when he arrives at her set trailer however the house is shaking as chloe and her hunky co star are having a little romantic tryst the writer and the actress are through hurt and mad as a hatter owen goes back to nyc sympathetic friends decide to set him up on a blind date with nadine milla jovovich to get him out of his sulky funk but it goes badly as the duo mix like oil and water mostly due to each having a strong personality and owen's huge shoulder chip yet over the next few months astonishingly nadine and owen become pals who confide in each other and hang out can it turn into something more well who the heck cares this film is so stupid that most folks will yank it out of the dvd player after the first ten minutes the script is pathetic dismal and oh stupid too then again gives a very obnoxious and offensive performance as well jovovich is not much better but who could look good with the lines she has to spout william baldwin too reaches a career low with his crude and sex crazy role as owen's brother the only cast member who is any good is richards but she must cringe when she looks back at this one okay the costumes and production values are adequate then too there is one clever element in that occasionally the characters will speak their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they are truly thinking that doesn't save the film from bomb status don't be stupid dear film and romcom lovers do not rent buy or borrow this gigantic turkey i am the stupidest person on earth today for watching this thing until the bitter end
<START> if you have enjoyed the butterfly effect donnie darko or the machinist you will enjoy k pax too br br to me this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end spacey delivers a great performance as also lets not forget the appearance of saul williams in the movie who i am a big fan of br br after watching it i recommended the movie to lots of my friends and everyone was pretty much blown away br br but still it is very underrated maybe because of the lack of action and explosions i'm sorry this is not a movie about blowing things up it's about how humans behave and how people live in worlds that don't exist br br go on and enjoy
<START> the one who says that lucio fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of splatter is probably mad the italian director is a legend among hardcore horror fans and his work exceeds the barriers of the genre who can forgot his western crime or fantasy flicks this is probably his goriest film and unfortunately one the last a horror director fulci as himself starts hallucinating about gruesome murders he goes to a psychiatrist who makes him believe he is the criminal in this time the doctor begins a long chain of serial crimes with such a plot the movie should have been filled with something and there are corpses crashed or melted heads stabbings decapitations chainsaw dismemberment and many others kind of boring sometimes the film is saved by the excessive violence that will definitely please the gore addicts
<START> i awarded this presentation 4 stars they are all for the script which has been butchered beyond recognition in places what can possibly be said they took one of the finest plays written in the last century and methodically robbed it of its heart humor and humanity i don't really blame the actors who are probably doing their best with shoddy direction and incomplete characters because the very complete characters of the stage version have had their insides and insights ripped out i do very much blame the director who seems to strain to find ways to undermine the script there are so many awkward pauses awkwardly re staged moments and awkwardly re imagined line readings in this tv movie that at times i forgot ever loving the play i'm not one of these people who thinks that genius plays are automatically inferior on film quite the contrary but this particular genius play has been tremendously under served by this outing now i hope they'll make a real film of this play the world deserves it
<START> mas oyama was the most successful karate master of the late 20th century he rejected the training of the karate clubs of the time focusing on an intense no holds form of training he eventually built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools across the world without compromising his teachings the testing in the schools are still some of the most physically challenging tests any martial art school requires one non physical hardship oyama faced was prejudice due to his korean ancestry and he spent time proving that loyalties were to japan and japanese karate this movie series was part of that effort although anyone who had the chance to meet oyama i did would never question his allegiance to japan in this series most famous student sonny chiba is called upon to portray his master br br oyama arrives from the countryside where he has been training alone he challenges and makes short work of the established karate schools he encounters disgusted by the state of karate oyama returns to his lone training he eventually picks up a student falls in love and gets in the way of gangsters who are allied with the established karate schools in the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull how much of the film is true is questionable br br that oyama could kill a bull with his bare hands is true he was called on to repeat this feat numerous times there are filmed instances of oyama actually doing this although sometimes the bulls seemed to be tethered as oyama was getting on in years sonny chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is quite good chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner but at this point in time he was certainly above average br br as a whole the movie is good much better then most martial art films in the drama department i always wondered why it's not more well known possibly it the very realistic depictions of martial arts people are shown getting tired and hurt unlike 99 of action film where the hero is a limitless fountain of energy and each blow instantly dispatches an opponent to death chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch perhaps viewers rather not have their entertainment reflect reality so closely br br recommended especially for martial artists
<START> curse of the wolf starts as reluctant werewolf dakota renee manages to escape from her into the city where 6 months later she is working in a vet's the rest of pack are unhappy want her back their leader michael todd says she will come back to them but fat werewolf franklin brian heffron picks her scent up the pack decides to force the issue get her back using her affections for her human friends including her boyfriend danny dennis carver can dakota save danny finally rid herself of her werewolf pursuers i doubt you will care br br executive produced written directed by len who also had a fairly large role in the film as stick i was dreading watching curse of the wolf since was the man behind swamp zombies 2005 which is surely one of the worst films ever made ever unfortunately my worst fears were confirmed one has to say that curse of the wolf is a truly horrible film in every way both conceptually technically curse of the wolf is the sort of film where the low budget dictates what happens the script rather than the script dictating the budget you get the impression that everything was written conceived to take advantage of the few sets actor's they had you can almost imagine the makers saying we've got a few actor's some basic equipment a couple of locations so lets make a horror film around them the story is awful michael finds the location of dakota by looking at a large dog two women are taking for a walk the character's are awful a big fat werewolf guy who farts a lot the dialogue is awful just about every line in the thing there's never any motivation for anything that happens why are the pack so desperate to get dakota back people just do seemingly random things since director background is in martial arts he insists in inserting lots of random martial arts fight sequences into the plot no offence but this is meant to be a horror film not a martial arts one isn't it in fact apart from the presence of a few werewolves you would be hard pushed to describe curse of the wolf as anything approaching a horror film at almost two hours in length it feels like it goes on forever is so slow uneventful it's just not funny br br director was obviously working on a low budget but film making this bad should be a crime there's no continuity between shots the fight scenes look awful are so poorly staged it's untrue it's sometimes impossible to follow what's going on be it because of the choppy editing poor camera angles or the fact that it is sometimes so dark that you literally can't see a thing seriously there are times during curse of the wolf where the screen is totally black you can't see a thing i would hate to have to sit through this watching it on a fuzzy low resolution vhs the sound is awful too you can hear the wind breeze against the microphone there are also lots of other unpleasant unwanted ambient sounds during just about every scene did the production actually have any lighting gear while making this it doesn't feel like it the special effects mostly consist of werewolf mask's that look like the sort of thing shops sell at halloween for the kids basically they look awful br br technically curse of the wolf is as bad as they come i'm sorry because i know this had a low budget but it's truly horrible to sit through try to garner some entertainment from this is high school film student quality i'm sorry if that sounds unkind but it's a fact the acting is well you can probably guess so i'll stop myself right here before i say something else negative i mean i've done enough of that already i really take no pleasure in it br br curse of the wolf is terrible both conceptually technically this is a real chore to sit through curse of the wolf is the type of film where while your watching it time seems to stand still it's the type of film that lasts for almost two hours yet feels like two years one of the worst films you or i am ever likely to see definitely one to avoid
<START> the fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and of course more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie the story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out in one moment you think that something happens to coach jones or radio well it does but certainly not what you'd expect br br the film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by ed harris cuba gooding jr are some of their best in my opinion the ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right well i guess that was what michael mike rich were trying to do first class movie br br birch denmark
<START> the jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie the only sci fi part is the woolly mammoths living in the present day br br elephants are attacking villages in a part of india and these attacks are also killing people an expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this an american hunter blames these elephants are being frightened by woolly mammoths which are suppose to be extinct nobody believes him at first but they do when the mammoths appear at the end an earthquake finishes them off br br the jungle was shot on location in india and has a lot of nice scenery and some good indian music including some songs which keep the movie moving along nicely the mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks stuck on br br the cast includes rod cameron cesar romero the lost continent and marie windsor cat women of the moon br br the jungle is worth seeing just for the scenery and music very enjoyable br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> i wish i could find some good things to say about this animated sequel but not really a sequel to atlantis the lost empire but this would be a very short comment the magic that the first one had is nowhere to be found here the animation is pretty poor all over the characters themselves are not very well drawn the backgrounds and the foregrounds are also not good there's very little attention to detail here and instead of a compelling and engaging story we have 3 short stories which are boring and don't make a lot of sense i swear even the characters sounded like they were bored and would rather be somewhere else which says that the voice actors were bored and wanted to be someplace else at least that's the impression some of the same actors return for this dismal effort but an integral par of the success of the first one was michael j fox as the main hero milo thatch i get the distinct impression this movie was just thrown together to capitalize on the success of the first one without much thought or care but at least cree summer returns as the voice of kida that's probably the only good thing about this movie and even she doesn't seem to have her heart completely in it mind you i guess you couldn't blame any of the cast for not giving their all considering what they had to work with or rather not work with this is a straight to video movie and i use the term loosely which should have went straight to the nearest landfill anyway shame on disney consumers deserve much better than this this one gets a 0 10 and a well deserved one at that p u
