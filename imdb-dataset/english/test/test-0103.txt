<START> it's a bit difficult to believe that this came from the same director that gave us hellraiser where's the style the foreboding and the charm i mean hellraiser is not a great horror film but at least it had something is like a large ball of bad ideas poorly executed from the opening there is a problem with subtlety the monsters are shown in the first shot the opening dream sequence shows too much for too long our hero doesn't display professional acting skills but no one expected that from this bastard genre there are killings that one wishes were more interesting then we have david cronenberg the man was never really meant to be an actor he fills the role of the creepy psychiatrist adequately but what he should have done was step behind the camera and save this disaster then we come to a creepy fake graveyard with an over creepy fake gate this thing is not a huge improvement over the cemetery in plan 9 from outer space it gets worse when we meet the creatures in it there is nothing really wrong with the character design and make up effects here well except for the guy with no scalp the guy with a pointy chin and forehead and the fat guy with dark circles around his eyes the problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue that is given them barker's photography of the subterranean city is tired and this part of the story could have been made much better some might call what follows spoilers after our hero dies and becomes we wait around to see what he'll turn into there's talk of things that fly and werewolves but when the time comes for him to change they appearantly thought their hero too pretty to give a decent creature design with the turn in cronenberg's character the story just gets less interesting until the battle of freaks vs norms which is just bad barker's mythology failed him here there is no genius and little originality behind any of the picture could have used a larger budget a serious script and character design that doesn't leave you saying oh oh how lame what a waste not scary not cool not even very dark just weak
<START> when i watched this movie it was an afternoon after i got home from work i love horror movies and have seen some really cheesy ones but this takes the cake the plot presented to the viewer in the beginning of the movie seems a little intriguing but as the movie progresses the script makes a wrong turn with horrible cliches and bad presentation which in turn makes the movie completely dull and boring i don't mean to keep criticizing the script and plot because believe me that is not the worst part i have to say as a whole the acting was not terrible for beginning actors and i was impressed with taylor locke this being one of his first movies the worst part of the movie was the special effects they reeked of low budget and really ruined the viewers entertainment even if he had been remotely interested in the plot i do recommend you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors
<START> for years i hesitated watching this movie now i know why not only is it a comedy that fails at being even remotely funny but there's also just nothing to laugh at about the movie it was even worse than i'd expected i rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money i have never seen a film that annoyed me that much it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie i have used imdb for some time but felt obligated to register just to help prevent poor unsuspecting folks from renting or worse buying this stinker really a waste of time and money i must say that the plot line is awful
<START> bronson and ireland in their last film together make a likable pair he is more restrained than usual and she has become a winning actress but as a thriller the film is totally worthless its premise is downright silly and its pace is much too rushed
<START> a ridiculous comedy given an arms flailing direction i love one of the comments here couldn't be made today well neither could the philadelphia story without a car chase or two nonetheless does that mean the picture is worse for the wear for being old fashioned i don't think susan slept here was good for any generation and it should fester peacefully in the memories of debbie reynolds buffs there is no sparkle in this story of a screenwriter who latches onto a much younger girl for dick powell makes his farewell screen appearance in what must have been an embarrassment to him reynolds is pallid produced by one harriet parsons who gives her famous mother louella a number of inane plugs 1 2 from
<START> this film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the kennedy assassination the are far too many mistakes in this film for me to point out it is a film of the kennedy assassination but many of the important facts have been altered there are missing scenes and many of the scenes after the president's limo passes the sign don't fit in both kennedys move noticeably slower then the other four people in front of them next time you watch this film look for things that don't add up such as the texas gov and his along with the ss men in the front lunge forward but you can see that the limo is not stopping or slowing down in fact is is accelerating this film is clearly an attempt at a cover up
<START> this is one of the best looking films of the past few years the fact that it was done on a virtual shoestring 1 8 million or so they say on the dvd they infer that they ended up with even less financing makes it all the more impressive not simply the photography but the design and particularly the locations eastern montana which are at once authentically american and otherworldly br br too bad there isn't a coherent movie to go with it an extremely promising setup of the last 48 hours of clearing out a rural town in 1955 before it will be flooded for a dam is washed away with pretentious mumbo jumbo alluding to angels and a dying child and what is presented as the real world is hopelessly arch note to the polish brothers the coen brothers are funny you are not br br no doubt many cineastes will find northfork 's abundant symbolism and as marks of some sort of profundity the sort that sophisticated types wrestle the night away with in while the braindead masses watch charlie's angels or something sigh if you insist br br in the meantime recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its' impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty
<START> first i rated this movie 10 10 to me it's simply one of the best i saw since i was born i'm 23 but i saw numerous films the story is cruel but reality is too not it went deep into me and stirred my bowels i saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me and i still remember it br br second there is no 'national this expression is a direct translation from the french for this movie i mean it's not because it is a french movie that i put it so high it has really caught me when i saw it furthermore i don't know well marcel carne's filmography so i don't know if it is or not his best movie but i know it is not his most famous hotel du nord quai des brumes and les enfants du paradis are the most famous br br third the movie's in b w but it deals with inter temporal problems of youth not acne like love friends and studies in a modern way it could even be remade frame by frame with actual young actors a dolby tm sound and special effects a car crash it would still be a great film br br problem maybe is it a film to be seen by young adults from 16 to 25 years old and above of course for its message to be well understood did i say it was a great movie
<START> i can't remember the last time a movie was so boring that i walked out the weatherman and the island were both so bad that i thought about it but i even stayed to the end in those this movie was incomprehensible not funny and just went on and on and on like some other commentators i wondered if parts were just french humor that i didn't get or if the characters were serious i finally just gave up and tried napping because i didn't want to disturb my husband if he was enjoying it but he noticed and let me know that it was okay if i wanted to leave and out the door we went he would like to know how it ended if lived or died etc i don't even care
<START> there are moments when you don't want those deep drama series when you don't want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on there are moments when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of action and cool characters for those moments you have cleopatra br br i was one of those who actually enjoyed charlie's angels critics said it was to superficial and silly but the thing is that's the point people who can't relax and expected a serious movie hated it it's exactly the same with cleopatra it is superficial it has silly and unrealistic characters and that's why i like it it isn't like any other series br br the first season wasn't very good the character cleo was irritating and a little too much the story was a little lame and you didn't get to know the characters very much but hey they only had 20 minutes in every episode br br in the last 5 6 episodes of cleopatra they finally gave the series full 40 minutes length and it was here i started to love it the series finally started to grow into a very qualitative series too bad they had to cancel the series because the last episodes of cleopatra actually was very good i will never forget hel sarge and cleo unique characters that only the creators of xena could have created
<START> the according to this mockumentary is a mysterious br br creature that has been killing and eating hispanic goats in latin br br america and mexico for years one has crossed the border into br br southern texas and a cute intrepid no i did not br br make up that word go to an isolated ranch to find one her uncle br br was killed by the creature and some grainy video footage of the br br monster exists she takes a badass black guy with a gun and two br br cameramen for easy to edit coverage and they go for br br ten minutes into the film they find it br br the rest of the film has the team of documentarians getting br br attacked by the bloodthirsty monster and stilted dialogue at one br br point the team runs into a couple of hottie witches who lead them br br to the nest for 100 if only the fbi knew about how br br cheaply tex witches could be bought as informants whole br br decades of mythical beast reports could be cleared up with a br br blank check br br in the end after the bloody deaths of characters you don't give a br br goat's patoot about a is captured killed and br br autopsied the only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the br br makeup department's efforts in such a cheap film br br the film is shot on video just like bwp yet the cameraman br br characters never reload their tapes or their camera br br batteries the lead actress here is awful the beauty of the br br average bwp was its use of improvisation during the production br br here all the lines are written and are delivered like a poorly br br rehearsed christmas pageant br br the film is tinged with racism as well the only african american br br here is a loudmouthed gun nut at one point as the crew breaks br br into an abandoned house they find a trio of illegal immigrants who br br comically ask them if they are from the ins chortle chortle br br the monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit and nothing more for br br such a lumbering and awkward beast he is able to sneak up on br br the cast pretty quietly whether they have idiotically locked br br themselves in a giant cage as bait or cannot seem to get their br br only vehicle started br br the gore is gruesome but when surrounded by this kind of br br stupidity it loses all of its effectiveness i do not know if this was br br shot before or after bwp but i can honestly say this is the worst br br film ever made in southern texas about a mythical beast pray br br there are not any sequels i will start a letter writing campaign to br br troma br br this is rated r for strong physical violence gun violence strong br br gore and profanity br br
<START> every saturday morning at 11 a m i watched superstars all the biggest events happened on this show at the time challenge which aired sunday mornings was decent too but all the big stuff happened on this show wrestlers would do all their interviews with mean gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a background that promoted them the matches were usually but sometimes you would see 2 mid square off in the main event there were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a feud these segments ranged from pipers pit the body shop the flower shop the snake pit the brother love show the funeral parlor and the barber shop i don't recall any titles changing hands on this show that usually happened at pay per views and saturday nights main event
<START> as muppet movies go this is easily and clearly the best it features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age a solid script and some great disneyesque songs and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of henson's talent the story is basic and the jokes are many leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable br br this is simply fun but it is also a well made well written beautifully endearing classic br br it rates an 8 9 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i was actually satisfied when i played this game the graphics were something new the missions were great but yet i felt i wanted more out of this game for a james bond game its pretty good but not as good as his other games it would be great if they could make a for it it would be much better then this may just be cuz i'm into games as resident evil dead rising and those kind of games so it could be better but it was ok to play one thing i absolutely hated about this game was she was irritating dying all the time and she couldn't run either i recommend this game for those who like fps games more than i do 7 10 stars
<START> an american werewolf in paris wasn't really that good compared to the original the original didn't use computer effects for the werewolf and they looked more realistic the werewolf effects in this film looked too cartoonish most of all the movie did not have enough for me for a horror film to enjoy
