<START> for all the viewers who have seen 'the cure' would agree with me on this comment that it is a superb movie and is very heartwarming joseph and brad prove their star quality in this movie along with dexter's mother annabella sciorra br br when i first watched the cure on tv i didn't know what to expect but as i watched this masterpiece it soon became clear what it was about dexter an 11 year old boy who is plagued with aids sits around his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his next door neighbour eric which at first is a little awkward for the 2 boys but they soon became good friends br br during the film i kept wondering what would happen to the two boys as they kept me wondering i wondered how the heck they would get to new orleans sitting a door with a sea biscuit under it pulling an crocodile behind it there were other great scenes throughout the movie br br but the part that reached out to me was the part when dexter's health started to deteriorate you just couldn't help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out i thought at the first prank they played that dexter was really dead he obviously wasn't silly me but when they play the third something is very wrong dexter doesn't get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter at that point the victim of their prank soon announces that poor dexter had died at that part i lost it i balled my eyes out and from that scene onwards i was crying you just have to as the end nears you start to understand eric's loss and then the movie ends on a nice note with dexters shoe floating ever so slowly down the river br br overall this movie was excellent it has laughter adventure emotion and sadness etc when you put that in a blender you get an excellent must watch film peter horton has done a great job directing this film and i believe its certainly one of his best but for now i will try to search for this movie on dvd if it exists that is once again a superb movie that will take you on an emotional
<START> journey to the far side of the sun aka doppelganger is an entertaining twilight zone style sci fi offering from gerry and sylvia anderson the team behind space 1999 ufo thunderbirds fireball 5 and others in the film roy thinnes of the invaders tv show and ian hendry star as astronauts sent on a flight to a planet which shares an exact orbit of the earth but on the opposite side of the sun hence previously hidden from view a pushy european space flight director over acted by the late patrick gets the flight fast tracked and after rigorous training the astronauts are good to go thus begins the best sequences in the film the launch flight and landing on the 'other' earth dazzling rocket miniature work by derek meddings and a dream like elegant spaceflight somewhat reminiscent of the best moments of 2001 a space odyssey are easy highlights of the movie the landing on the doppelganger earth is both exciting and eerie after this the twilight zone aspect of the film kicks in with a plot lifted almost whole from the classic tz episode the parallel that aside the film is still solid sci fi with some intriguing world' stuff to chew on backwards writing and left handed handshakes for example less successful are the scenes depicting a mid 21st century earth where all the men wear and nehru jackets and all the women wear mini skirts some of the relationships with women in the film are very 'non by today's standards as well and in the most consistent failing of most 20th century sci fi the computers telephones and other hardware are all big colorful and clunky right out of patrick the prisoner no one the digital age if one can accept these failings in foresight the movie is very interesting with a solid lead performance by thinnes as the troubled astronaut and with a nice 1960s early '70s style nihilistic ending for fans of retro sci fi like myself this is a journey worth taking
<START> it just goes to show how wrong you can be i had not expected to like this film i was disappointed by both the kill bill films although i preferred the second and death proof although it was better in the shorter cut of the double bill release i love reservoir dogs admire pulp fiction and think that jackie brown is tarantino's most mature piece of film making technically his most superior including the last great performance elicited from robert de niro since then it seems to me while his films have been okay i haven't hated them he has been treading water in referential reverential self indulgent juvenilia br br then i read the script last year for basterds and i hated it sure it had some typical qt flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful there were a couple of great characters but on page it was more juvenile rubbish largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting basterds of the title it made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film the trailers did nothing to convince me i only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a tarantino q a following in london i figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in q a as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person br br so little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of basterds br br easily mr tarantino's best work since jackie brown it is a triumph br br yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story they are not the driving force yes eli roth is stunt casting but he works fine with little to do but look aggressive and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared while i admired mr tarantino for using stuntwoman zoe bell as herself in death proof in order to amp up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film the same could be said of tarantino's own appearances in several films especially robert from dusk till dawn which tarantino wrote br br what really makes this work is how big it is the spaghetti western vibe to much of the style dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of kill bill the violence is so big the audacity so big brad pitt is so big in the trailers the hitler moment and pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious pitt is actually brilliant here exactly what he needs to be he is blustering samurai in yojimbo he is robards cheyenne from once upon a time in the west there is a very james coburn vibe to him and of course a suitably lee marvin edge br br christoph waltz who i did not previously known and melanie laurent who i first noticed in a brilliant french language british short film by sean ellis are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting which seemed to desert him in death proof waltz is equally large in his performance chilling yet theatrical he is fonda from van cleef from good the bad the ugly and laurent is suitably cardinale innocence but tough a fighter they both dazzle here br br that every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously the laughs and there are loads come organically only mike myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough with the help of a fantastic michael who seems pulled directly from the mold of attenborough's great escape leader br br all the actors shine and tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes but ones that work with the story the introduction of hugo is a riot after a sensational slow burn opening and a glorious intro to those basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by br br it also looks beautiful marking this as a return to real film making rather than just self indulgent silliness the musical choices as always are inspired from morricone on br br the film is audacious and hilarious after a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining but also involving and impressive film should be this one when i would never have believed it from script form welcome back qt
<START> all in all an excellent movie from that time and source coming from warner brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before wwii provided you don't take it at all seriously the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say jfk this one may actually be more honest about it though as it essentially admits along the way that it's not to be taken as particularly fact based but more of a stylishly semi heroic portrayal it's worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today the ny times review conceded that audiences would dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film described the biographical account of custer's life as fanciful and pointed out that the presentation of custer's motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts they could have really gone overboard in building up custer one supposes but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around but appropriately determined principled and inspirational br br flynn and dehavilland doing their 8th movie together in 7 years and their last are so comfortable together and play off each other so easily at this point that it's not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here with a first time pairing it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to custer but these two make it work the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together the greatly underrated michael curtiz but given that he had worked with them on the previous year's similar themed santa fe trail it's understandable if he chose to opt out of this one they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light brigade both terrific so we can't really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh br br raoul walsh the director here is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences which are outstanding and everything else outdoors the interior scenes are a little more uneven but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well as does warner bros' outstanding cast of usual suspects and new faces greenstreet gene lockhart anthony quinn arthur kennedy etc i would have liked it better if kennedy's character had been a bit less standard i generally like his work but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene the part could have been better written and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle as he'd only been in films for one year walsh probably took him for this after doing high sierra together br br various highlights include the depiction probably imagined of the genesis of as the cavalry theme the last half hour is particularly outstanding especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership followed by the final battle scenes a thoroughly rousing adventure br br 8 of 10
<START> i was lucky enough to grow up surfing in san diego not the biggest waves in the world but it was a hell of childhood i'll tell you that and i have seen a lot of so called surfer flicks in my life after watching north shore for the first time just now all i can say is thank god i never saw this as a kid if i had seen this and mistakenly thought that this was a realistic portrayal of the surf scene i would sold my board and totally gotten into i don't know accounting or something br br seriously this movie has a as much in common with real surfing as top gun has was real military life the acting is terrible the music is worse the cinematography is iffy at best and oh my god what was laird thinking wow do not see this movie it sucks if you want a real surf flick see riding giants hell watch surf's up instead of this seriously sucks sucks bad sucks real bad br br ps had to change my summery from wtf to wtf because apparently we are supposed to whisper on this site no yelling d
<START> usually i have a lot of luck with these small scale movies i looked at the cast leary lovitz delpy wuhrer estevez how bad could it be unfortunately the answer was pretty bad i have a hard time remembering a movie that had such poor execution of a plot that had potential
<START> martin lawrence is not a funny man i he just has too much on his mind and he is too mad which trips his puns pretty early in the game he tries to make fun of critics which boils down to f them then he goes on to rather primitive sexual jokes on smokers with throat cancer and it just goes downhill from there 3 10
<START> i saw this movie with very low expectations i didn't know a lot about it so i wasn't sure if it was going to be worth it br br the story did an ok job of getting you curious about these ruins they travel to the suspense continues when the mayans show up and force them to stay at the ruins br br then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless the amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock value br br the fact that they didn't make any attempt to fight the vines from hell they had fire and didn't try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not they quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real it reminded me of the old horror movies where the people just scream and yell and don't have half a brain to try to fight back
<START> that was one of the lines in a trailer about this film and for once the publicists did not exaggerate all six of the featured players here are on the screen 99 of the time so they have to be good br br it's always fascinating how certain plot premises can be worked for either comedy to a deadly serious situation mary boland of the ditzy and charlie of the henpecked play their usual characters who are planning to motor all the way to california to share expenses they advertise for someone to share the ride they get burns and allen and a monster of a dog that same premise was a deadly serious one several generations later in kalifornia br br of course if you're traveling with gracie allen you know you're going to be going absolutely nuts trying to figure her monty reasoning about the whole world and if that ain't enough you get to run into w c fields part time sheriff and full time pool hustler who's living in sin with alison but back then we didn't delve into such things br br a real classic comedy from the thirties not to be missed
<START> i watched this film recently for the first time in over 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised i remembered a film that caught the mood and feel of britain in the mid 1960s without falling into the britain' clichÃ©s that so many other films thought they had to propagate my memory proved correct those who feel that this is like a tv play are not entirely wrong but while andrea newman was to become famous for risquÃ© tv drama this film is more in the tradition of the 'kitchen such as 'saturday night and sunday morning' but with an emphasis on middle class rather than working class life rod steiger is excellent as the middle aged angst ridden lead unhappily married to a repressed and apparently barren wife claire bloom the onset of the is the the backdrop for the drama in which old values and are challenged this is the stage for the central character played by judy geeson a role which at the time was a shocking departure from the typical prim behaviour of contemporary heroines the reversal of roles with the girl rating her conquests in a little black book was a precursor to the feminist movement and was criticised at the time for promoting promiscuity among young girls the irony of these criticisms is to be seen in both claire bloom's and peggy characters who are both dissatisfied peter hall made few films and on this evidence that is a great shame steiger is exemplary and wholly credible showing why he was so highly regarded
<START> a bland title disguises this solidly example of old fashioned hollywood entertainment this film proves a largely successful hodgepodge of several disparate elements a period piece a romantic drama a crime movie and a political thriller interestingly though made by fox its protagonists Â robert taylor and barbara stanwyck Â were both usually associated with other studios their on screen chemistry here is palpable and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years' time while a bit too young taylor is a dashing hero a marine personally appointed by president mckinley to uncover the culprits behind an organized clean up of numerous banks unsurprisingly no sooner has he tracked them down led by smooth brian donlevy and thuggish victor mclaglen that he falls for a chanteuse naturally stanwyck who has thrown her lot with the gang Â although truth be told singing is far from being the actress' forte similarly apart from having to prove his worth to make it into their fold he has to vie with mclaglen for stanwyck's attentions by the way the practical joker persona of the former reminded me a lot of charley chase in sons of the desert 1933 which incidentally was likewise directed by william a later on taylor is in two minds about involving stanwyck in the impending bait and tries to offer his resignation to the president while eloping with the girl Â but the jealous rival disrupts his plans the robbery gone awry we find donlevy dead and the other two in jail taylor's hopes for intervention Â having meanwhile learned the identity of the elusive and obviously prominent 'inside man' Â are seemingly dashed when the president winds up assassinated himself a great plot twist though the resulting eleventh hour suspense feels contrived to get back to the film's jumble of styles even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste the romantic triangle slows things up and it somewhat on the thriller aspect this emerges a handsome production indeed Â with the actors already mentioned ably supported by the likes of john carradine who unaccountably disappears after just one scene douglas sig and as two american presidents sidney the bubbly theodore roosevelt and frank conroy mckinley
<START> being warner brothers' second historical drama featuring civil war and battle of the little big horn general george armstrong custer they died with their boots on warner brothers 1941 was the far more accurate of the two especially when contrasted with santa fe trail warner brothers 1940 which really didn't set the bar very high br br although both pictures were starring vehicles for errol flynn there was a change in the casting the part of general custer whereas it was dutch himself ronald reagan portraying the flamboyant egomaniacal cavalryman in the earlier picture with mr flynn playing and later confederate hero general j e b or jeb stuart errol took on the custer part for they died with their boots on br br once again the warner brothers' propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the warner's repertory company are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity and all is really happening right before our very own eyes major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses such as elizabeth bacon mrs custer co star olivia de havilland ned sharpe arthur kennedy samuel bacon gene lockhart chief crazy horse anthony quinn charlie major stanley general phillip sheridan john litel the bacon's maid hattie mcdaniel br br the rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited though skilled players such as joe sawyer eleanor parker minor watson tod andrews irving bacon roy lane chandler spencer charters frank ferguson francis ford william forrest george russell hicks william hopper hooper eddie keane fred kelsey sam mcdaniel patrick mcvey frank eddie parker addison richards ray teal jim all american himself minerva urecal dick wessel gig young and many many more br br the film moves very quickly particularly in the early goings then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the post civil war years the assignment of custer as a colonel in the 7th cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the little big horn in montana under the guidance of director griffith veteran raoul walsh the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions from the very serious exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes looking as if they were matthew brady civil war photos as with most any of mr walsh's films he punctuates and the end of many a scene with a little humor but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy farce actually br br as previously mentioned this is much more factual than its predecessor santa fe trail last time we'll mention it honest schultz honor however that is not to say that it wasn't without a few little bits of artistic and literary license as indeed just about any biopic will have it would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious of literary license is that business about custer's being accidentally promoted to the rank of brigadier general it just didn't happen that way yet the gag both helped the film to move along while it underscored the whole light carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film br br director walsh and mr flynn collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary civil war hero that was very close to the real life man and they did this on top of the recreation of an incident being the massacre by the sioux the cheyenne and the of custer and his 7th cavalry at the little big horn at the time of its occurrence june 25 1876 custer's last stand was as big an incident and shock to the americans' national psyche as were the japanese attack on pearl harbor december 7 1941 or the atrocities perpetrated by the islamic fascists to new york's twin trade towers and the united states' armed headquarters in the pentagon arlington virginia on september 11 2002 br br just as so many films of that period of world war ii and the years immediately before there were so many incidents in it that were if not intentionally done were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another global conflict such as we were in by the time of they died with their boots on was finishing up its original theatrical release period br br poodle schnitz
<START> i hate this movie i have never seen such utter complete trash in my life i live in france so it turned out that i was in the front line to watch this awful movie at first it seemed cool kind of like something about a cursed forest that chomps people unfortunately it turned out it was something quite different a good start with a girl that meets a guy and all that whatnot then the girl gets threatening messages in the form of ravens shut up in her bathroom closet ludicrous from that bit and on the movie starts to slide downhill very quickly with a lot of desperate thrashing in the process the movie ends with sacrificial druids galore and ancient ugly stinky creatures coming back from the past to kill a few people many questions were rushing around my head by then why the heck did they bring back that scummy monster do druids look like maniacs dressed in bedsheets why did they even bother making this movie the climax of the movie was so goofy i laughed all the way through it the awful stinky monster does battle with the two young women who appear to be expert kung fu masters and the professor gets sliced in two or something what surprised me was that the monster was so slow and ungainly in battle wasn't it supposed to be a god of war or something anyway the movie in it's death throws was a pitiful sight a brief of the contents of this movie kung fu mayhem druid stones mysterious murders Ã  la thriller ancient prophecies shabby ravens old clumsy war god nutty professor complete and utter diseased worm eaten godforsaken goddam recycled fake wannabe ludicrous sh t things i learned from this movie ancient war gods are lousy at kung fu all young women who study archeology at university in france are kung fu experts professors are so resistant they can survive being sliced in two by a saw mass without any injuries
<START> this is my first comment on a movie in here i have to say that of all the bad films i ever seen including braindead for an example this is really worse i promise don't even look at it it is boring bad acting bad script and plot bad effects the whole movie is one big piece of crap if i could i would give 0 stars out of 10 but since the lowest is 1 which is awful i need to vote that but i would say the movie is worse than awful br br don't pain yourself by seeing this movie and hoping it will get better because i can tell you already now it wont i hoped that there might would come one single scene which would be worth watching there didn't came any good scene at all br br what an excellent piece of crap br br and coolio as a vampire lol lmao
