<START> on paper this looks a good film michael caine plays a tough and ruthless boxing promoter who's son is up for a title the pity is that when the story is transferred from paper to my television screen it loses a certain everything i had hoped we'd be seen emulating his definitive role in get carter and as the film progresses it does seem to take on the qualities of a tough gritty revenge thriller but the whole tone of the film jumps around so much you'll be confused as to what genre it's trying to fit in to for example caine who you can't believe in as billy shiner simpson he's simply michael caine has a laugh out line as he refers to someone as hattie jacques then in a supposedly humorous moment has his henchmen break someone's arm oh how i laughed i mean it's supposed to elicit a laugh the way it plays out on screen isn't it but these seems at odds with the way the rest of the film plays out br br obviously director john irvin doesn't know what approach to take with scott screenplay irvin isn't a bad director and is well regarded for his war films such as the dogs of war and hamburger hill but he's ill suited to this type of violent drama and one can't help but feel he might have been intimidated somewhat by a living legend like caine caine does give the impression he's just doing it for the money and the well known faces in supporting roles like landua and are basically just cameos who could be played by anyone
<START> i usually love teen high school genre flicks but this film was really lacking in originality the only premise this film has is four friends cheating their way through high school and the strain it puts on their friendship there's just not enough depth in the story or the characters to keep the viewers attention for the full length of the film the acting isn't all that bad although the actors don't really have much to work with as the dialog is tripe and clichÃ©' after watching this movie one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think i must make this film no wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release andrew is a hack avoid or burn
<START> wow umm this was a very how to say it different type of movie it calls itself a comedy but it wasnt really out loud funny at all it was insane if you are willing to accept that 3 people survive a calamity of a global scale why not 4 or 5 and why did it suddenly end without anything happening they could have made this much better by simply having another element in the plot such as a dumpy female for the ugly dude or something ahh br br i dunno watch it it wasnt that bad sorta funny at times i guess br br schneider
<START> as long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever it's not bad br br it's on par with sam raimi's hercules the legendary journeys as far as plot acting humour and production values are concerned you'll see the similarities at several points most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that br br jack palance commands the screen as well as ever and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best same for oliver reed the problem is that their strong performances make square jawed don less than stellar acting skills seem even more awkward perennial bit player was very good as well playing a character much like in the aforementioned hercules br br if you enjoyed the low budget swords and sorcery movies of the early 80s you're probably going to enjoy this show as well it's actually a shame they attached the marco polo name to it it really has nothing to do with life contrary to the expectations of most of the people who will want to watch this movie
<START> stan laurel regarded putting pants on philip as the first l h film the second hundred years was the first 'official' l h film but this was the one where stan completely resigned himself not only to performing he had signed on with the hal roach studios as a director and man' before certain situations among them oliver hardy's accident with a leg of lamb leading to stan having to replace him and the extra money that performing would provide for himself and his new wife lois brought about his historic return to performing as well as writing directing editing and involvement in other areas of production but also realised the fact that he was part of a team that worked well together this therefore is an historic and very important film in the history of comedy br br it is also a surprisingly funny little silent film rather different from what laurel hardy would become known for and from what they are more immediately associated with today the characters of 'stan ollie do not appear scottish stan laurel plays the nephew of oliver hardy a respectable man about town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange looking fellow with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls there are some very funny moments in this well made charming little movie and the performances of these two kings of comedy are spot on watch stan's little and smile that says well know when he sees girls or the hair scene at the airport for instance hilarious br br watch this film if you can with backing music from the beau hunks orchestra available on the video releases which enhances the 1920s feel and is very very pleasant to listen to it's a brilliant and underrated little film which is why i said it was 'surprisingly' funny
<START> i kind of like jag it do have itÂ´s charm but lately itÂ´s to much propaganda in it for an outsider a non american the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much br br i donÂ´t like that and mackenzie goes from being lawyers as they were in the early parts of the tv show to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents its almost like watching a recruitment video from the us army br br i still watch the show so itÂ´s not that bad but i would prefer more episodes when and mackenzie investigates military accidents and donÂ´t save the world in the future
<START> i saw the mst3k version of this film and it is a bad movie but its not nearly as bad as its low imdb rating currently 1 8 out of 10 at least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is that it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is so pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isn't very smart either or he would have figured out to stay away from the conniving girl betty and even more pathetic than marv is his father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of the film is the heist sequence at the end but even that is so weakly executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very funny mst3k episode as mike and the do a great job making fun of it
<START> 1969 was the year new york city was the place was the second robert downey film to achieve some recognition the first was elbows 1966 achieved a much wider release pound 1970 and palace 1972 were even more profane and obnoxious those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the prince's feature film career for several years br br the subject at hand is and it is a mad farce satire that has to be seen to be believed i'm not going to go through the plot here what plot people looking for a plot are going to be scratching their heads keep scratching this film is not about plot one could compare this to a mel brooks movie only without the hollywood parody party that mel always threw i also see a little bit of monty python in this by the way this film was shot before monty had debuted on the bbc br br i notice that the gags and lines that are drop dead hilarious do not transfer well by word of mouth you have to see them within the context of the film there are some flaws in the film but even the flaws are unique for instance actors often repeat the same line over and over again and somehow it works how many syllables mario says the six girl has got to have soul etc br br the b w photography is outstanding the sound score is even better the editing is only so so the acting is above average the script is priceless the jokes are as un pc as you can get mr bad news says sonny williams just got caught in a motel with a 13 year old girl says well at least he's not superstitious uptight conservatives beware the anti establishment mindset of this film will drive you straight out of the room nothing is sacred br br there are many things in this film that pertain to today no smoking reverse racism with african americans treating caucasions like trash the manipulation of mass media over the masses madison avenue hollywood intentionally pedaling something that any 8 year old can tell is pure garbage the internet i'm talking about the drum interracial dating i could go on and on br br i should also mention that there is about 8 min of this film that was shot in 16 mm color these are the commercials shot by agency the spots work fairly well the first time around they get tiresome though on repeated viewings the real magic here is within the b w sections of the film it's the non lines they stay with you rent yourself a schmuck i love you i love you i love you did you take your pill anything that i have to say would just be redundant and a host of others i also really like the bit with the mounted up on the wall the game warden wanted me to throw it back i put up such a fight i decided to have it mounted br br standouts in the cast include buddy as bodyguard 1 he should have been a much bigger star antonio fargas as the arab he did go on to stardom on tv and in films arnold johnson has the right look as robert downey used his own voice instead because arnold couldn't remember some of his lines also downey realized that he could fill in any additional dialog jokes later on if he dubbed his lead actor br br the film does have some shortcomings the short run time is one i wish the beginning with the white board members would have been extended stan and allen garfield are outstanding the ending seams to have been thrown together as if he just couldn't think of any more gags all in all this is one of the best low budget independent films of it's time a time when very few played outside of new york chicago san francisco and l a anyone who loves satire and comedy should see this at least twice downey's is ahead of and beyond it's time
<START> this film stars peter lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who to america unfortunately shortly after his arrival he's in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned because he looks so awful no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness where exactly the film goes from there you'll just need to see for yourself br br i scored this movie an 8 because for the money spent to make it it's a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting the film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises in addition the excellent acting by lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles this is an excellent film and delivers more than most a pictures of the day
<START> this movie is a real low budget production yet i will not say anything more on that as it already has been covered i give this movie a low rating for the story alone but i met the director the night i saw the film and he gave me an additional reason to dislike the movie he asked me how i enjoyed it and i told him that it was not easy to like my main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters i was never convinced that they were close i also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children becoming friends was too late in the film br br he told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script that they were added because he felt like i did that the two main characters did not appear close he went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction as they were out of money i agree that they did not do much for the film br br another fact about the movie that i was not aware of is the actor who had the lead wrote the script based on his own personal experience this is usually a bad move as some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction the viewer the story is so close to home that the writer make too many assumption as to the audience's reaction to his own tragedy and the story is tragic however it did not work for me as i never cared for any of the characters least of all the lead what was presented were two evil people out to make a buck by any means regardless who gets hurt when ms young's character decides to give up he evil ways it appears that she does so because she is ineffective not because she knows she is doing wrong if the movie has a message then i suspect that only the writer is aware of it
<START> boring rank nefarious plot some of the worst direction i've ever come across inane acting and horribly clichÃ©d the movie ends with one of the main characters waking from a dream what's with that even jr from dallas couldn't survive that lame twist br br you have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship developing between a main character and a young girl which is ostensibly meant to be fatherly but which comes off as perverse you have freshman community college movie school special effects with loopholes the size of the kimberly hole this is like children of the corn meets passion of the christ imposed on an endless loop of government administration training video by the end of it if you aren't contemplating ending it you have no brain br br don't bother
<START> this is a tv movie based on the murder of martha in greenwich in the mid 1970's based how much on truth it's hard to tell this much is certain it is based on the book written by mark anyway the movie depicts the crime in flashbacks and its aftermath including the arrest of a suspect some 25 years after who was never considered a suspect at the time in the movie of course is largely responsible for the arrest and closure of the case for martha's surviving family in particular her mother the narrative of the film is by the ghost of martha talking in the first person this is a very effective device in this movie to me it adds more impact to the movie and puts a human face on the murder victim if only an actress playing the part maggie grace plays martha and i was really impressed with her there is no way for certain to know mark motive in investigating the crime it could have been out of a sense of justice and maybe he really cared or maybe he just saw dollar signs from a future bestselling book either way it makes for an interesting movie it's well acted and fairly fast paced i don't think there was a lot of extra unnecessary stuff in the movie just what was needed to tell the story one could argue that they left out things that would have shed a bit more light on the proceedings and one would be right also one may argue that the ending was abrupt and again one would be right but as i said for me i think they told the story with at least most of the essentials anything else would have likely required a miniseries as an aside there is a miniseries entitled a season in purgatory which came out 6 years 1996 which this movie has some parallels to even if only faint however if you like this movie then you may be interested in a season in purgatory it is my belief that a season in purgatory is in fact a fictionalized account of the same crime anyway for me murder in greenwich is an 8 10
<START> man i had my doubts i love kathy bates but i thought how good can this be i had never even heard of this thing you know it was one of those things we gave it 20 minutes and we'll turn it off if it sucks and we were locked in from the get go this is a very winsome fun movie it's quirky you know i mean you've got a lounge singer a murderer and a believable one you have farce then kathy bates in all her acting splendor rupert everett finally acting to his real potential dan ackroyd and a dwarf that will make you laugh out loud i tell ya you'll laugh you'll cry br br maybe i had a weird week but i think this film is on the level of fried green tomatoes if you don't like that movie maybe you won't like this but i think it was a great movie i went out and bought the dvd
<START> four guys jacks go into the restaurant business with a fifth guy and lose all common sense they allow themselves to be abused worse than textile workers at the turn of the century without simply leaving the situation this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen i just hope i can resell this item to someone who might like it br br it is true that it holds your attention if you can let the illogical plot developments not bother you too much it is very silly throughout however especially once a stranger enters the restaurant who is he guess br br
<START> the last person who dies before new years is cursed to drive the phantom carriage for a whole year picking up the souls of the dead br br i saw a scene from this old silent swedish horror film on youtube and decided to track down the whole movie it was well worth the work finding it because it's an absolutely amazing movie for the time it was made it has a wonderfully eerie atmosphere the old time horror film makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere sadly many of today's film makers don't seem to understand how important setting and atmosphere are and go for the cheap jump scares the visual effects are excellent considering its date of production if you can find a copy of this i highly recommend giving it a watch 9 10
